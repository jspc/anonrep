don't really know why Deep Purple are so popular in the States all of a sudden," says Jon Lord, organist, backstage. "We've been around for five years playing roughly the same type of music."

With massive followings in Europe, the Far East, Scandinavia and Australia, Deep Purple have been one of the world's top groups for some time now, one of the prototype heavy-metal bands. America, where only last year their records began to turn gold and where they did six tours of mostly sold-out concerts, was the last to catch Purple Fever.

The reason may lie in the band's own erratic, feverish, hepatitis-ridden history:

Deep Purple began in the summer of 1968 with a hit single, "Hush," on Tetragammatron Records. The band, not quite yet metallic in sound, included Rod Evans on lead vocals, Nicky Simper on bass, Jon Lord, organ, Ritchie Blackmore, lead guitar, and Ian Paice, drums. Three quick albums brought them mounting recognition until late 1969, when the Hollywood-based record company suddenly folded.

Deep Purple decided then they needed maybe a year off, for some self-evaluation; in the interim they fired singer Evans and bassist Simper, hiring Ian Gillan and Roger Glover in their places.

"Rod," said Paice, "is very good when he tries," but he wasn't hot to be a raving rocker. "He's much happier on ballads and lighter sounds. Ian is a rock & roll singer." As for Nicky: "Well, I won't go into too much detail about him, but we had so many differences with him it was inevitable that he went."

By the time the group resurfaced, the label was Warner Brothers and the album was Deep Purple and the Royal Philharmonic, a rock-classical concerto written and scored totally by Jon. Firmly rooted in the classics since childhood, Lord had been "itching to do something like it for a long time."

Next was In Rock, the precise representation of second-generation Deep Purple and, in the eyes of many, the definitive heavy-metal masterwork. For the most part ignored in the US, the LP was a smash throughout Europe and insured the band's comeback. Deep Purple themselves still consider In Rock their best effort to date.

"The album came quite easily for us," said Paice. "The hardest thing about it was following it up. We were working so much due to the success that when we tried to do the next album, Fireball, we realized we had no ideas whatsoever. Fireball turned out to be a bit of a 'Let's hope we've got an album's worth here' type of thing."

The band finally took off for their first major American tour in 1971. But then Gillan fell ill with hepatitis, and they went back to England and eventually to France to try and cut another album, renting out the empty, acoustically perfect Montreaux ballroom.

But two days before recording was to begin, the ballroom burned down.

"We got diverted to the local theater," said Lord, "but that started shaking to pieces with the volume. The people who lived in the neighborhood kept calling the cops. Finally we found a hotel that had been shut for the season. We soundproofed all the windows, sealed off one hall and made Machine Head in the corridor."

Machine Head was the one that broke open the US market, and back came Purple again for another try at an American tour. This time they lasted four days until Blackmore came down with hepatitis and flew home. Attempting to complete the tour with Al Kooper as a temporary stand-in, things went well during a hasty pre-show rehearsal. Shortly before showtime, however, Kooper had a nervous breakdown and canceled out. Randy California was the next to step in and fill the vacant guitar spot in time for a Quebec show. Just prior to the group's boarding the plane to deliver them to the show, Air Canada went on strike.

Jon Lord squints into the dressing room lights as he remembers. "Randy was brilliant, God bless 'em, but everything had gotten to be such a bitch that we had to go home. We just couldn't take it any longer."

"Our morale was really low when we got back home," said Paice. "We had developed lots of internal problems because we had become stagnant. We had been forced to stop the momentum and of course our tempers started getting short."

As soon as Blackmore recovered, Deep Purple were back in the States making up the many, many cancellations. They somehow got out another studio LP at the same time, Who Do We Think We Are!

Paice: "Originally we were gonna do it in Rome, in June of last year. We got there, as usual, with no ideas. But, it was sunny there. Lovely moon. We'd all just spend our time in the swimming pool. Things weren't planned well either and the building we were gonna record in wasn't properly soundproofed. By the time everything was ready, we all realized that there was only three days left. So, we only got one track out of it, 'Woman From Tokyo.' We had to go all the way back home again, with all that cost. . .  $24,000 I believe, and do it all again in Germany. That cost us another $24,000. We had no time planned for that second session, so we had to cancel concerts here just to find the three weeks it took to record the album."

"It's a weird album," confessed Ritchie Blackmore. "The way we did it was to put the backing tracks down and Ian would come in the following day, which the rest of the band had off, to put the vocal track down. We never got together once during the recording."

Why?

"Because we're very lazy."

The future for Deep Purple looks somewhat less than serendipitous. Those internal complications have to be resolved, and after their current world tour (to promote their latest album, Made In Japan), they'll stop for three months. Self-evaluation time again.

Asked if personnel changes are imminent, Lord asks back: "What can I say?

"There's a need to reestablish ourselves from within," he says, "because all we've done in the past three years is work. So in those three months we'll make a lot of changes. Changes that we've wanted to make for some time, but have been unable to."

As for Blackmore, who stays in a separate dressing room, he is forming a blues power-trio as an alternative to Deep Purple. While maintaining that both bands will hold him as their lead guitarist, Ritchie is already speaking about his involvement with Deep Purple in the past tense.

"I want to play the blues," he says firmly. "I know there's so many bands playing it, but Deep Purple is too 'poppy.' I've been through being a big star and all that. I've made my money that way, now I'm gonna do something which I like. With Deep Purple it was always 75% liking what you did and the rest was. . .  making money."

It was 1972, and "Take It Easy" was on the charts. The Eagles came to San Diego, where I was working for a local underground paper. I grabbed my photographer buddy Gary from school and made a plan. We were going to sneak backstage and grab an interview with this new group. I loved their harmonies, and the confident style that charged their first hit.

Eagles Glenn Frey: 20 Essential Songs »
Glenn Frey introduced the band: "We're the Eagles, from southern California." They were explosive, right off the top, opening with their a cappella rendition of "Seven Bridges Road." Then, this new band, filled with piss and vinegar, launched immediately into their hit. There was nothing "laid back" about them. No "saving the hit for last." They were a lean-and-mean American group, strong on vocals and stronger on attitude.

Gary and I talked our way backstage with ease and found the band's road manager, who threw us all into a small dressing room where drummer-singer Don Henley, bassist Randy Meisner and guitarist Bernie Leadon took us through the story of the band. Every other sentence began with "And then Glenn. ..." Glenn Frey was the only guy not in the room.

After about a half hour, the door whipped open and Frey walked in. He had a Detroit swagger, a memorable drawl and patter like a baseball player who'd just been called up to the majors. He was part musician, part tactician and part stand-up comic.

It was immediately obvious that Glenn had his eye on the big picture. He'd studied other bands, how they broke up or went creatively dry. He had a plan laid out. He even used that first interview to promote his friends — Jackson Browne, John David Souther and songwriter Jack Tempchin. His laugh and demeanor were infectious. Immediately, you wanted to be in his club.

At the end of the interview, I asked the band to pose together. The photo is one of my favorites. It captures one of their earliest, happiest, freest moments. A band that would later brawl memorably was giddy and happy that night, arms wrapped around each other. The look on Glenn's face is priceless: This is my band, and we're on our way.

Glenn and I exchanged phone numbers, and he stayed in touch. He brought me in early on the making of the Eagles' second album, Desperado. As I'd begun to do more and more work as a correspondent for Rolling Stone, he began to complain to me about the magazine calling the band "soft" or "laid-back," along with much of the East Coast literati. The Eagles, in my time around them, were many things, but "laid-back" was not one of them.

Glenn's jocular street wisdom was pretty addictive to a guy who'd never had a brother. It was easy to share your personal stuff with Glenn. He'd help you plot out the answers to your problems like a seasoned coach. He once laid out the psychology of getting and maintaining a buzz at a party. ("Two beers back to back, then one every hour and 15 minutes. ... You'll be loquacious, and all the girls will talk with you.")

I found that I went to him often for gender-specific advice that would have stumped or even horrified my sister. When I once told him about a girl I was in love with from afar, a girl I was sure I needed to impress with a better "act," Frey reacted hugely. "No!" he said with a pirate's smile. "You don't need an act — all you need is to be you." He leaned in close. "If she can't smell your qualifications, move on."

Frey was a big character, and as I began to write fiction, I often plucked liberally from things he'd told me. The above quote I gave to Mike Damone in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

Glenn valued camaraderie, which was apparent whenever he was around crew and friends or in a recording session. Glenn and Don would coach the vocal takes like seasoned pros, giving sharp directions, as well as nicknames and athletic truisms worthy of John Wooden. Along with longtime friend and manager Irving Azoff, Glenn was also careful about keeping his band above financial water. He'd read too many biographies about genius musicians who were now broke. Early in the band's history, he took me aside. "I don't want to be super-rich; I don't need the big money," he once said. "I just want 1 million to spend on a house and a life, and 1 million to put in the bank and live off the interest. And then I got a life."

Six months later, before playing a sold-out show in Oakland, he casually told me the good news. "Cameron, remember what I told you about the $2 million?" I nodded. "Got it. Now all I gotta do is make a buncha records that I would buy myself!"

The sound of those records made for scores of hits, changed the way concerts and the music business would be conducted in modern times, and also redefined what we now know as country music. None of this was by accident. Glenn was the playmaker. His and Henley's deep knowledge of sounds, of R&B and soul, country and pure rock, warmed up three different generations. Their success never even flagged during the decade-plus hiatus they took starting in 1980.

Their 2013 documentary, History of the Eagles, told the whole warts-and-all story. And in it, you see the Frey that his friends knew. Funny. Tough. Cynical. A ruleskeeper. Along the way, these scrappy carpetbaggers from Texas and Detroit wrote about Los Angeles with a clarity and wit that few have matched, in novels, music or movies. Critically, the East Coast critical intelligentsia continued to slight them, and sometimes even mock them.

Frey gave up trying to please them long ago. The Beach Boys had the far more media-attractive tale of Brian Wilson and a troubled young genius' mythology of pain. The Eagles had Glenn and Don, an avalanche of public acceptance, fewer scandals and a cleareyed adult's view of the same California. They were, frankly, a winning team. Some never forgave them for their success. But that success, as Frey would explain to you, was always part of the plan. "You can be in the gutter talking about all your missed opportunities," he said, "or you can be successful, and pull the other guy out of the gutter."

Frey made success look like a ballgame anybody could suit up and play with him. Within a half hour, he'd have given you a nickname. Because I made him laugh with an imitation of James Brown's MC ("Ladies and gentlemen, it is star time tonight. ..."), I was "Get Down Clown." And Glenn, who along with Henley made a regular habit of charming the ladies with gallant good manners, was "the Teen King." Because of his ability with charting Eagles harmonies, he was also "the Lone Arranger," and once, because he'd collected a small garbage bin filled with weed in his backyard, he was "Roach." Don Felder, his guitarist, was "Fingers." The other band members had a psychedelic ever-changing collection of nicknames that each had deep and swirling meanings. I forgot most of 'em, but Glenn never did.

When I later moved in with Glenn and Henley for a couple of weeks while they were writing the One of These Nights album, we talked about life and love and music for days on end. I watched as they incorporated their nighttime adventures into daytime classics. They worked meticulously on songs like "Lyin' Eyes" and "One of These Nights," often spending hours on a single word.

And at one point, Glenn took me aside. We had the very conversation that appears in Almost Famous, when William is guided to leave some stuff off the record. Frey eventually capitulated. "Everything's on the record," he said. And then the famous Glenn smile. "Just make us look cool."

In Jerry Maguire, Glenn played Dennis Wilburn, the general manager of the Arizona Cardinals. I had auditioned several other actors for the part. Somehow they all had a problem harassing and beating down Tom Cruise's character, who was then at his low point. Many were intimidated delivering soul-crushing lines to such a superstar. Glenn came in and had more fun harassing Cruise than a kid at summer camp. "It's just sports to me," he said.

His turnaround at the end of the film was far sweeter for the vigor he put into the performance. He was an excellent actor with generous people skills, friends with the entire crew. For all those who worked with him, from the beginning to the end, he was the team captain who you could call late at night. Glenn was also never far from the Teen King, awash with the enthusiasm and wickedly fun humor of his youth.

After the enormous critical and commercial victory of the band's masterpiece, Hotel California, Glenn also became a family man. He approached that role with the same verve of the kid who first got in a car and drove from Michigan to Laurel Canyon, spotted David Crosby on his first day and never looked back.

For fans of Frey feeling the pain now, I have a simple suggestion. Enjoy a long-neck Budweiser, and put on some soul music. Something with great vocals, like Johnnie Taylor's "I've Been Born Again." Or a song that Glenn was so intent on playing for me that he drove back and forth on Sunset Boulevard, again and again, just to listen and study: Eddie Hinton's "Get Off in It."

A last image. Working on our show Roadies, I was set on hiring Glenn to play the band's skilled but flighty manager, Preston. The word that came back was upsetting. Frey was in tough shape, hospitalized but fighting. I tried not to worry too much. Glenn Frey is, and always was, built for the fourth-quarter win. I last saw him over the summer, and I told him I wanted him to act again. He was enthusiastic. "I got an idea for a TV show," he said. "Kauai Five-0. I'm Hawaii's toughest cop, and I live in Kauai. And in the off-season ..." There was that pirate smile again. "... I get to be in the Eagles. It's a good life, right?"

"Take It Easy" had only been out a few months in the summer of 1972. I was a big fan of the song, and was still in high school when the Eagles came to the San Diego Civic Theatre. They were the opening act on a bill with Procol Harum and Cold Blood, and the Civic Theatre was a few blocks from my house. I bought a ticket, and brought my tape recorder. The idea was to slip backstage and talk the band into an interview for a local underground paper, The San Diego Door.

The Eagles opened the evening without an introduction. The lights lowered, and they began with an a cappella version of "Seven Bridges Road," quickly adding instruments and swinging into "Take It Easy." They were fierce and joyful, playing with all the piss and vinegar of a young band hitting its early stride. I slipped backstage with my photographer friend from high school, Gary Elam, and asked their road manager if I could interview the band. They were eager to talk. Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner all hung out in a tiny dressing room and spent hours detailing their history and their dreams of hitting the big-time. "If you like us, you should check out our friend Jackson Browne and John David Souther," Glenn Frey said excitedly, clutching a long-neck Budweiser. They posed for a photo by the amps, arms around each other, and we exchanged phone numbers. I stayed in touch with them. (Little did I know, that fuzzy group shot would be one of the only known photos of all four original members hugging each other. Looking at it today, it has the same slightly surreal quality of one of those photos of the Loch Ness Monster.)

When I started writing for Rolling Stone the next year, the Eagles became one of the bands that I regularly covered for the magazine. As they became more and more popular, I saw how they chafed over the magazine's assessment of their music. The band felt marginalized as a "California laid-back" band, and they regarded the whole "mellow L.A." moniker as an East Coast critical prejudice. The band could be tough as nails personally, but always spirited and very serious about their songwriting. Business-wise, they had studied all the pitfalls of bands that preceded them and vowed not to end up on the trash heap of history. With manager Irving Azoff at their side, they were driven with ambition, and boisterous in the pursuit of good humor and authenticity. From the very beginning, they exuded a quicksilver spirit — forward motion was everything. Up close, the Eagles were many things, but "laid back" was not one of them.

For the Rolling Stone cover story, I spent many months with the band: sitting in on their exacting studio session, joining them on the road, tagging along with them at bars and clubs and around Los Angeles, watching them take in the social nuances and inhabit all the haunts that would later turn up as iconography in their songs. To compose their then-new album, Henley and Frey moved in together in a home atop the Hollywood Hills, a place with a night-time vista they dubbed "The Million Dollar View." They invited me to move in with them, and I did for a couple weeks in 1975 as they wrote the songs that would become their album One of These Nights. I was there, with tape recorder on, as they wrote "Lyin' Eyes" and "After the Thrill Is Gone," the title song and many others, including an unrecorded gem called "When a Bad Boy Meets a Bad Girl in the Night." Though Henley was from Texas, and Frey from Detroit, their goal was to capture the California zeitgeist. As they looked out on that glittery horizon, the songwriters kept topping each other with ideas and phrases that could have layers of meaning. "Nothing can just skim the surface," Henley told Frey. The partnership was electric, a guided missile of creativity. I had a front-row seat for their process, and wanted the RS piece to show their chemistry from the inside out. For a notoriously press-shy group, this was way off the grid. They left no doors closed and no avenues off-limits. It was journalistic nirvana, and the Budweiser flowed as we talked for many hours over many nights.

Frey was hungry for new influences, and a big fan of soul. He loved the Thom Bell–produced hits by the Spinners, the Teddy Pendergrass records cut in Philadelphia, and some of that spirit landed in the song "One of These Nights." In fact, one of the discarded titles for the album came from a tip Frey had heard Thom Bell used in the studio. To gain the perfect drum sound, Bell often instructed the drummer to put a wallet on the snare drum. Wallet on the Snare was one of the working titles for the album.

It was a different time for journalism, a long way from our current world of quick sit-downs or rote, 45-minute junket interviews. The piece became one of my favorites, a sprawling look at life inside the band as they laughed and brawled and buckled down to make the very best of what they knew was now their time. I was on duty throughout. Frey and Henley wanted the article to be completely representative of how seriously they took the mantle of being a premier American band. It was thrilling to watch them chart their course and hit all the marks. As many other bands fractured and fell around them, Henley and Frey charged forward, taking a firm grasp at the helm of the band, changing members when necessary and always staying focused on the songs. Always, their conversations returned to songwriting. I still have many of their discarded yellow legal sheets, filled with lyrics that were honed and refined until the words were up to their very exacting high standards. It occurred to me at the time, and many other instances afterward, how their trajectory never veered very far from the game plan they first laid out in that tiny dressing room in San Diego, with Procul Harum thundering on the other side of the wall. The group photo by the amps says it all. From the very beginning, they were built to soar.

"They left no doors closed and no avenues off-limits. It was journalistic nirvana."

Neal Preston, my then-roommate and best friend, was the photographer for the Rolling Stone assignment. Neal and I spent a lot of time on the road with the band, shooting candid shots of the members and planning the cover shoot with them. There were a few memorable group portraits that could have been used, particularly one taken outside their dressing room at the Day on the Green concert — it's the band at their mugging best. Later, Frey had the idea to get out on a boat, put some oxygen into the mix and take some shots out at sea. Just the band, relaxed, eyes on the horizon, with a lot of blue sky. That was the session that made the cover but Preston had many alternates, some of which I think he's sharing with you.

Of all the artifacts I saved from the research, my favorites are that first group shot, Neal Preston's outtakes of the cover shot, and of course a cassette with "Lyin' Eyes" scrawled on it. It's a two-hour real-time document of the writing of one of their biggest hits, and an audio snapshot of the collaborative process that would produce so many of the Henley-Frey songs that still fill the airwaves. Looking back, I think the article caught the excitement, dedication and humor of the end of the Eagles' first career act. These were the early adventures of, as they joked, "Those Darn Eagles." Just around the bend was "Hotel California" — more angst, more peaks, more fireworks and many more hits — but in 1975, they were still newcomers to the West Coast, still young men aiming to stake their claim and make good on all the promise of the future, shimmering ahead of them like the lights that made up "The Million Dollar View."

The year was 1973, and I'd just walked through the San Francisco offices of Rolling Stone magazine for the first time. Before this I had been a voice on the telephone, a freelance journalist dealing with music editor Ben Fong-Torres. Now Fong-Torres was taking me to the office of the magazine's founder and publisher, Jann Wenner. (The hand that shook John Lennon's hand, I remember thinking, is now shaking my hand.) Annie Leibovitz's original photos lined the walls. All around me were the real-life versions of names I studied in the magazine's hallowed pages. I was sixteen, with an orange bag strapped to my shoulder, and I felt every eye in the place on me. It felt like a scene from a movie. Twenty-seven years later, it was.

Standing on the Los Angeles set of Almost Famous, in a room outfitted to look exactly like the old Rolling Stone offices of '73, I quietly took in a big whiff of my past. Standing nearby was a sixteen-year-old unknown actor from Utah named Patrick Fugit. My orange bag was strapped across his shoulder. I watched him walk the hall-way, every eye on him, moving into an office where he would meet actor Eion Bailey, as Jann Wenner. We were halfway through filming, and it was just one of the daily time-trippingly emotional moments that came with making a movie based partially – OK, totally – on my life. Personal movies, just like personally based records, have always been my favorites. Albums like Joni Mitchell's Blue or movies like Francois Truffaut's The Four Hundred Blows and Barry Levinson's Diner are timeless. They make it look easy. But the hardest part – and I say this with a note of caution to any future inward-looking directors – is casting yourself.

It is January of 1999, and it's there in the little ways people are looking at me. The gentle manner with which friends and loved ones place a lingering hand on my shoulder and ask, "How you doing?" It's there in the extra looks of concern all around me.

They think I'm going crazy.

How I'd gotten to this point, I wasn't sure. After the surprise success of Jerry Maguire, I'd had a couple decent script ideas. One was an homage to my favorite TV show, Hawaii Five-O. I'd been writing a psychedelic Jane's Addiction-filled thriller set on Kauai. It sounded good in my head. On paper . . . hmmmmmm. I hit a rough stretch and went flying back into the arms of an idea I'd been returning to for years. It was a warm blanket of a script. I'd been circling it for a long time. It was an autobiographical movie set in 1973, featuring the music I'd loved and a host of vivid characters I'd met as a fifteen-year-old journalist. The problem had always been the character at the center of the script. The one based on me. Again and again, I'd left the "me" character to fill in later. I even gave him a colorless name that screamed, Better name to come – William Miller. I mean, come on. I can barely listen to my own voice on the answering machine.

Then, in a burst of creativity, it started to fall together. The key had been to get more personal with it, rather than less. I began to write about my own family in fairly raw terms. How my schoolteacher mother had banned rock from our house, how my sister had heroically smuggled it in and how rock changed my life . . . and changed our family. Before I knew it, I had an untitled, 172-page script. I showed it to Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald, the heads of production at DreamWorks films, who liked it immediately and in turn showed it to Steven Spielberg. Half expecting them all to consider it more a novel than a film, I had returned to the warm creative waters of the Hawaiian thriller. I was visiting Walter and Laurie one evening when Walter handed me the phone. "It's Steven," he said.

"I read your script," said Steven Spielberg. "Shoot every word."

And so began the journey of actually making Almost Famous. I began casting each part meticulously, seeing tens upon tens of helpful actors and working on every tiny character in the script . . . except the one based on me. Gail Levin, our peerless and soon-to-be-sleepless casting director, had put feelers out all across America and England. I delayed diving into the videotapes that were starting to flood our office. "I'll get into it next week," I'd say, every week. Somehow, next month always seemed like the best month to begin meeting . . . me.

The months clicked by as I carefully cast parts like New York Bellman, Fan #1, Long-Haired Guy in the Lobby and other seemingly crucial parts. Increasingly, Gail would slip in a young actor to play William Miller. The process was always otherworldly. A young, pale, long-faced actor would shuffle in and face me, the older, pale, long-faced version of himself, and we would look at each other, making uncomfortable small talk.

"So, do you like music?" I'd ask, thinking, This is strange.

"Sure," the actor would say, thinking, This is weird. We'd read the scenes for a bit, and then later I'd invariably tell Gail, "Let's keep looking."

"What are you looking for?" she'd ask.

"It's not quite right," I'd say. "Now  about the part of the Third Groupie . . ."

We were in New York for further casting when a call came in from Walter Parkes and Laurie MacDonald. We chatted cheerfully about how well everything was going with the smaller parts.

"Great," said Walter. "But do you have the kid? Because the kid is in every scene."

"I'm still looking."

"We're running out of time," Walter implored. A cheap shrink could have figured this one out long before. Very elegantly, in the way only we can delude ourselves, I still believed it was a movie about rock, family, groupies, musicians and music . . . everything but the elephant in the room. "You gotta cast yourself," said Parkes. "Because the kid is the movie."

Late at night, Gail had been poring over the hundreds of hours of audition tapes. We knew we wanted a fresh face, someone who would personify pure fandom and the look of a kid who'd run away and joined the rock & roll circus. Our models were Louis Malle's protagonist in the incredible Murmur of the Heart, and, of course, the granddaddy of all cinema doppelgängers, Jean-Pierre Léaud, the star of Francois Truffaut's autobiographical films. But finding a young discovery who can carry an entire movie is the holy grail of casting. Most filmmakers who conduct nation-wide searches invariably give up and go with a proven commodity, someone with credentials. As the pressure ratcheted up, I began to watch more and more audition tapes with Gail. English boys. City boys. Southern boys. A fourteen-year-old from Idaho sent a tape of himself playing Nirvana's "Lithium" on guitar, followed by a brilliant monologue on why music matters. (We later hired him for the Topeka party scene.) All of them trying hard to hit a bull's-eye, and I hadn't even hung up a target.

That's when the gentle hands started resting on my shoulder. That's when I started to realize the train was thundering down the track. I was a long way from the comfort of that Hawaiian thriller. Holy shit. I was making a movie about me.

There was a tape, though. A tape from Utah that Gail had been impressed with, watching on one of those late nights in New York City. Only one problem. Somehow, in the packing and transporting of umpteen boxes back to Los Angeles, the tape had vanished. Frantic calls went out to the New York hotel, the airfreight company that had shipped the tapes, the production assistants who'd boxed them. The now-mythical Utah tape was nowhere to be found. Finally, after searching every box from a now double-nationwide search, the tape appeared, misfiled in a stack of rejects about to be destroyed. On a Sunday morning in February, we watched the audition of a kid named Patrick Fugit.

He was a pure soul, an authentic Utah kid with a bowl cut and a funny put-upon manner. He waved his arms around a lot. He made us laugh. A day and a half later, he stood in my office. His parents, Bruce and Jan, waited patiently downstairs. It was Patrick's first visit to Los Angeles, and he was very cool about it. But his saucerlike eyes gave him away. He took in every photo, every shred of everything in sight. He was a skateboarder but not a rock fan, not yet. He was a beginning drama student. He'd done two tiny walk-on parts for Touched by an Angel, the TV show that filmed near his hometown of Salt Lake City. He was sixteen. His favorite movie was Forrest Gump. Even his name was utterly real. Fugit. I could only imagine the nick-names he'd endured.

We spent an hour reading scenes and videotaping his performance. I shouted directions from behind the camera, in the middle of his acting. He rolled with it. "More angry," I'd say. He got angrier. And then, during a scene where the guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) is trying to convince William to come along to Cleveland for one more show, Fugit hit a stunning note. "I am not going to Cleveland!" he shouted. "I want to go home!" And he repeated it again, loudly, into the camera, emphasizing the words in sign language. He was not me. He didn't look or act like me. But his face, and the way he took in the world around him, reminded me of something more important – how it felt back in 1973. It was the first time I felt freed from the "me" of it all. He was the character, that boy at the circus, William Miller.

We gave ourselves a grace period. Patrick returned to Salt Lake, and I watched the tape a hundred times or more. I played Led Zeppelin and Neil Young tracks along with his audition. His face soaked up music. There was no mistaking it. This was our guy. Inexperienced and untrained as he was, he was joyously and unashamedly real. But there was one moment on the tape I kept returning to. It was Patrick's simple wave goodbye. His wave said more than my script. It was a young man's goodbye to the past, a split second before the future would change him forever. It's captured in the finished movie, too, when William Miller bids farewell to Russell Hammond in the hallway of the Topeka airport. To me, that wave was Pet Sounds, all in a gesture. It won Fugit the part.

"I'll call him tomorrow and give him the job," I said.

"No," said Gail, with the power of Zeus. "Call him now!"

I picked up the phone and called Patrick Fugit in Utah. The experience to come was deliriously fun and certainly tough. I learned more than ever about the privilege of being given a huge canvas on which to paint a film, a love letter to music. I did many takes. Shoot every word. I shot scenes from many angles. Shoot every word. I worked on every detail, large and small. Shoot every word. The great cinematographer John Toll, our producers, my wife, editor Joe Hutshing and the actors showed the patience of Job. Shoot every word. I didn't quite shoot every word; we came close. And rock would even invade Patrick's soul, too. The kid who once thought Led Zeppelin was "a singer" now craves Physical Graffiti. But this was all an unknown future as I sat waiting for Patrick to come to the phone.

"Hello," he said. His young, unchanged voice reminded me of someone I used to know.

"Patrick," I said. "It's Cameron. Do you want to come make a movie with us?"

I could hear him breathing on the other end of the line. Both our lives were about to change. "Wow," he said. "I'd love to come make a movie with you."

And onward we went. Fugit's performance in Almost Famous is his own creation, beyond all I'd imagined. In the course of the movie, Fugit's voice changes . . . he joins the circus . . . he gets tired . . . he rallies . . . he grows up a little, just like William Miller. And several months into filming, on a New York street where Jann Wenner had come to make a cameo appearance, I introduced the two. It had all come full circle.

"He's better looking than you were," cracked Wenner.

"Well, he's not exactly me," I said. "Thank God." 

There are two Eddie Vedders. One is quiet, shy, barely audible when he speaks. Loving and loved in return. The other is tortured, a bitter realist, a man capable of pointing out injustice and waging that war on the home front, inside himself. On a warm and windy late-spring day in San Rafael, Calif., it's easy to see which Eddie Vedder is shooting baskets outside the Site, the recording studio where Pearl Jam are finishing their second album. It is tortured Eddie, the one with the deep crease between his eyebrows.

"Your shot," calls Jeff Ament, the group's bassist. He bounces the ball to Vedder, who takes a long outside jumper. It rattles into the basket and rolls away. By the time Ament retrieves the ball, Vedder has already disappeared into the studio. His mind is on a new song, "Rearviewmirror." This is the last day of recording at the Site, and the track's fate hangs in the balance. It's a song about suicide . . . but it's too "catchy."

The choice of studio seemed perfect back in February, when the band decided to record the new album here. This idyllic studio compound in the hills outside San Francisco offered privacy and focus. Keith Richards had recorded here; his thank-you note to the studio is framed on the living-room wall. This is gorgeous country, where locals look out at the expansive green horizon and say things like "George Lucas owns everything to the left." This is where Pearl Jam would face the challenge of following up Ten, one of the most successful debut albums in rock. There was only one problem.

The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Pearl Jam, Ten

"I fucking hate it here," says Vedder, standing in the cool blue room where he is about to sing. "I've had a hard time." He places the lyric sheet on a stand between two turquoise-green guitars. "How do you make a rock record here? Maybe the old rockers, maybe they love this. Maybe they need the comfort and the relaxation. Maybe they need it to make dinner music."

Frustrated, Vedder shakes his head. He pulls at his black T-shirt, uncomfortable in his own skin. A long moment passes. Finally, producer Brendan O'Brien speaks over the intercom. "Ready to give it a shot?"
"Sure," Vedder says quietly, turning his back for the vocal. He slips on headphones, and for a long time the only sound in the room is his tapping foot.

"Took a drive today," he sings. "Time to emancipate/I guess it was the beatings/Made me wise . . ." He holds a shaking hand to his head. "But I'm not about to give thanks . . . or apologize."

Now listening carefully, his weight shifts from foot to foot. He growls and begins spitting on the floor. "Divided by fear . . ." Louder now. "Forced to endure/What I could not forgive . . ." He's bellowing now, eyes shut. "Saw things . . ." The room is filled with his anger. "Clearer . . . once you were in my . . ." Eight feet away, a snare drum leaning against the wall starts to shake. "Rearview . . . mirrorrrrrr!"

In another part of the building, Ament, the band's resident artist, prepares for a group meeting about the new album cover. For months, the unwritten rule had been Don't talk about it. Just make the record. Forget about the pressures on the other side of that hill. But now decisions must be made, and the band slowly gathers in the kitchen to look at Ament's ideas.

"I've been thinking about windows," Ament says, fighting nerves, passing his artwork ideas to the other members. Ament's distinctive hand-scripted style adorns all the group's T-shirts and record releases. On the table before them is a complex collection of his photos and sketches.

"Cool," says Vedder softly, just returned from the studio and still hunched from the emotional vocal. Stone Gossard and Mike McCready, the band's guitarists, study the ideas with growing enthusiasm. Buoyed, Ament continues. He likes the idea of contradiction. Conflicting images. The five members kick the concept around until it sticks. Contradiction. There is the lull that follows a winning idea.

"So are we talking about 'Daughter' as the first single?" drummer Dave Abbruzzese asks casually.
Suddenly, all air leaves the room. The other four members dog pile on Abbruzzese. What single? One meeting at a time! What do you mean, single? Abbruzzese shrugs. Perhaps it's still a little too soon to mention the unmentionable. Soon, the subject returns to the album-cover art. Abbruzzese suggests adding a battered and bolted New York City apartment window to the artwork. The idea is instantly accepted and the meeting ends on an exuberant note. The band disappears to play softball while Brendan O'Brien finishes the mix of "Rearviewmirror."

Abbruzzese stays behind, nursing a sore wrist. (He occasionally suffers from carpal-tunnel syndrome, which causes numbness in three of his fingers.) "To me, when I was younger and I heard about a band selling a million records, I thought the band would get together and jump up and down for at least a minute," he says with a wide-open East Texas laugh, "and just go, 'Wow, I can't believe it.' But it doesn't happen that way [in this band]. Me, I flip out. I jump up and down by myself."

For Abbruzzese, who co-wrote the album's opening track, "Go," it's sometimes hard to watch his band mates deal with success. "There's a lot of intensity over decisions," he says cheerfully. "And I think it's great. But every once in a while, I wish everyone would just let it go. Make a bad decision!" He looks out at the same green forest Vedder had raged at earlier. "Look at this place! It's paradise."

Sitting in a downtown-Seattle coffee shop a few weeks later, Stone Gossard analyzes the combustible nature of his band. "I think we're doing fine," he says in the clipped rhythm of an athlete. "I think we made a great record. Nobody's out buying limos and thinking they're the most amazing thing on earth. There's a natural balance in the band where we need each other. Everybody sees things from their own angle, and all those angles are the archetypes of the things you need to really cover your ass. It's what makes a band to me."

And he has heard the criticism of Pearl Jam's success. "If somebody wants to say, 'You guys used to be my favorite band, but you got too big' – to me, the problem with getting too big is not, innately, you get too big and all of a sudden you stop playing good music," Gossard says. "The problem is, when you get too big, you stop doing the things you used to do. Just being big doesn't mean you can't go in your basement and write a good song. I think people are capable of being a lot bigger on that rad big scale." He laughs. "A lot more people are capable of being big out there that just don't give themselves a chance."

At first, the songs on the new album, Pearl Jam, came in a burst. The initial week of recording at the Site had produced "Rats," "Blood," "Go" and a slow, potent version of their previously unrecorded stage favorite, "Leash." Then the band hit a wall. Vedder disappeared into San Francisco, often sleeping in his truck to preserve his fighting spirit. Hiking, he'd even picked up poison ivy. "He needed to get in the space of his songs," says Ament. "Soon we were back on track."

Album Reviews: Pearl Jam, Vs.

Pearl Jam is the band's turf statement, a personal declaration of the importance of music over idolatry. But the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity has fallen most solidly on Vedder, who spent much of his off-season wondering about the effects of being in such a high-profile band. Vedder had – uncharacteristically – even gotten into a barroom fight defending the band. (In a Waits-like voice, he offers a snippet of an unrecorded song that he has written about it: "Gave myself a black eye/To show off just how I was feeling.") And one night, while sitting out on a deserted coastal sand bluff, contemplating life after the death of a friend, guitarist Stefanie Sargent of 7 Year Bitch, he heard strange voices coming from the hill behind him. They were singing "Black," the fragile song that to Vedder had come to symbolize the overcommercialization of the band. He'd fought to keep it from getting overplayed, didn't want a video made of the song. Vedder hiked out of the bushes to ask the surprised hikers not to sing the song. Months later, he still remembers their odd and concerned looks as they faced the angst-filled author of the song.

"I had a hard time getting away," Vedder says now with a laugh. But as Ament says, the struggle is everything. "The push and pull," he says, "is what makes our band."


"Let's do 'Black,' says Gossard.

It's rehearsal time back in Seattle, June 1993. Later in the summer, Pearl Jam will do a brief "fun" tour of Europe, opening shows for Neil Young and U2, and the band has rented out the downtown Moore Theater for practice. Half-seriously, Gossard asks that the stage lights of the empty theater be darkened. (They are.) He begins strumming the simple chords that open this anguished song to a former lover. Then, hands in pockets, Vedder eases into the words. He gives himself, wrenchingly, to a thousand empty seats. When it's over, there is a buzz in the air. The band is clearly energized.

Soon Pearl Jam are racing with a new riff by Gossard. Abbruzzese tries a few different feels, locks in on one with Ament. Then McCready adds a spitfire lead. Like McCready himself, his playing is quietly expressive, marked by sudden explosions. Now Vedder joins in, trying random lyrics ("When it comes to modern times/You're standing in line"). His omnipresent yellow-tweed suitcase, the one filled with journals and lyrics and masks and tapes, is open and spread out onstage. He selects phrases and thoughts as the band blazes behind him. Before long, they've honed loose versions of two new songs.

At the heart of Pearl Jam is the relationship between Gossard and Vedder. "I consider us to be very different people," says Gossard, whose razor-edged wit is far different from Vedder's deadpan irony. "Almost polarized in a lot of ways. I mean, name any given issue, and we'll take opposite sides of it. We give each other the total different end of the spectrum so we can always somehow find the middle. My goal, what I really want to achieve, is not to need him. Because he is needed by so many people who don't really understand him."

Later, Vedder grabs a pitcher of beer at a bar next door, the Nightlite, and unwinds from the rehearsal. He reflects on singing "Black" for the first time in months. "There are certain songs that come from emotion," he says. "It's got nothing to do with melody or timing or even words; it has to do with the emotion behind the song. You can't put out 50 percent. You have to sing them from a feeling. Like 'Alive' and 'Jeremy' to this day – and 'Black.' Those songs, they tear me up."

Ament is sitting next to him. The two have not been out together socially since the 1992 Lollapalooza tour. They share the easy camaraderie of music lovers. "My relationship with the band," Vedder says, "began as a love affair on the phone with Jeff." Soon the two musicians are recalling the early history of Pearl Jam, the scuffling days of only two and a half years ago.

It had all begun with an unassuming tape marked stone gossard demos 91. The guitar-god magazines have only recently discovered it, but most Pearl Jam songs began life as a Gossard riff. One of his early favorites was a song called "Dollar Short," an unfinished track that he'd started working on back when he and bassist Ament were in Mother Love Bone. Love Bone was the promising Seattle hard-rock band they'd formed after the breakup of their previous group, grunge pioneers Green River. When Love Bone singer/songwriter Andrew Wood died in 1990 of a tragic heroin overdose, Ament – the Montana-born son of a barber – downshifted, playing around town with a group called the War Babies and returning to his other love, graphic arts. Gossard – a Seattle native whose father is a lawyer – barely put down his guitar, playing constantly, moving away from the trippy atmospherics of Love Bone and toward a hard-edged groove. Part of the new blueprint was "Dollar Short."

Eventually Gossard called in McCready, an explosive lead guitarist who had been so bummed out by the breakup of his own Seattle band, Shadow, that he'd started turning into a Republican – literally. He'd cut his hair, was working in a video store and was reading a book by archconservative Barry Goldwater. "I was becoming a staunch conservative," McCready says, "because I was so depressed." Gossard saw him more as his new secret weapon for the band he wanted to form. "Whatever you're playing," says Gossard, "'Cready comes in and lights the fuse."

As the Seattle sound started to gather momentum around them – Nirvana were about to enter the major-label arena, Sub Pop Records was flourishing – Gossard and McCready jammed in the attic room of Gossard's parents' house. That room had already been the musical hothouse for Green River and Mother Love Bone. When Ament joined the Gossard-McCready jams, inspiration struck again. "I knew we had a band," McCready says, "when we started playing that song 'Dollar Short.' "

Dave Krusen joined the band later, playing on Ten, but soon left to deal with some domestic problems. He was replaced by Abbruzzese, who had been playing in a funk band and co-hosting a radio show, Music We Like, in Houston. At first, Abbruzzese was tentative about playing rock full time; after two shows, he'd tattooed Ament's stick-figure Pearl Jam logo on his shoulder.

Today, listening to Gossard's original '91 demos is not unlike hearing Ten without the vocals – powerful but incomplete. The missing piece, it turned out, was in San Diego. Originally from Evanston, Ill., Vedder – better known on the San Diego music scene as "the guy who never slept" – had brought a Midwestern work ethic to the sunny beach community. Working at hyperspeed, laboring days at a petroleum company to finance his budding career as a singer and songwriter, Vedder had befriended Jack Irons, formerly of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons passed along Gossard's tape.

The demo tape from Seattle contained five instrumentals, Vedder remembers, but there was something about that one song, the one with that great bridge, that was triggering things that Vedder had kept long contained. It all came to a head one morning in the fog as he was surfing, the morning "Dollar Short" became a song called "Alive."

Vedder raced back to the Mission Beach apartment of his longtime girlfriend, Beth Liebling. Working from yellow Post-it pads lifted from his job, Vedder taped himself singing over three of the instrumentals. Together the three songs told a story, as Vedder recalls today, "based on things that had happened, and some I imagined." The "mini opera" tape was carefully designed by Vedder, the graphics Xeroxed at work and the package entitled Mamasan.

Sitting in his apartment in Seattle, Ament listened to the tape three times and picked up a phone. "Stone," he said, "you better get over here."

By the time Vedder arrived in Seattle, he'd already written "Black." All he'd requested in his earlier, lengthy phone conversations with Ament was not to waste time. He wanted to come straight from the airport – right to their rehearsal room – and make music. And that is what happened. The first song they played together was "Alive." Within a week, they were a fully functioning band. And Vedder's creative floodgates were wide open. Most of his songs, from "Why Go" to "Oceans," were real stories about people he knew. Some of them contained riddles, private messages to himself or friends. Even the lyrics printed on Ten are only partial, but it's hard to dispute the pain in his delivery of such aching lines as "Daddy didn't give attention/To the fact that Mommy didn't care."

"I don't know where all those songs came from," says Ament. "I know a little about his childhood. I know he loved [the Who's] Quadrophenia . . . I guess I don't know many details."

"Alive" set the tone for everything that would follow. The first song on Ten was also the first song to bring attention to the band. It was clearly Vedder's creative breakthrough, and the band's initial video celebrated a cathartic live performance of the song. In an early Los Angeles Times review, writer Chris William had even compared the song to the Who's "My Generation." Today, "Alive" is a Gen X rallying cry, but tonight, sitting in the Nightlite, Vedder reveals the true meaning of the song.

"Everybody writes about it like it's a life-affirmation thing – I'm really glad about that," he says with a rueful laugh. "It's a great interpretation. But 'Alive' is . . . it's torture. Which is why it's fucked up for me. Why I should probably learn how to sing another way. It would be easier. It's . . . it's too much."
Vedder continues: "The story of the song is that a mother is with a father, and the father dies. It's an intense thing because the son looks just like the father. The son grows up to be the father, the person that she lost. His father's dead, and now this confusion, his mother, his love, how does he love her, how does she love him? In fact, the mother, even though she marries somebody else, there's no one she's ever loved more than the father. You know how it is, first loves and stuff. And the guy dies. How could you ever get him back? But the son. He looks exactly like him. It's uncanny. So she wants him. The son is oblivious to it all. He doesn't know what the fuck is going on. He's still dealing, he's still growing up. He's still dealing with love, he's still dealing with the death of his father. All he knows is 'I'm still alive' – those three words, that's totally out of burden."

Elvis' "Suspicious Minds" blasts on the jukebox as Vedder continues. "Now the second verse is 'Oh, she walks slowly into a young man's room . . . I can remember to this very day . . . the look . . . the look.' And I don't say anything else. And because I'm saying, 'The look, the look,' everyone thinks it goes with 'on her face.' It's not on her face. The look is between her legs. Where do you go with that? That's where you came from.

"But 'I'm still alive.' I'm the lover that's still alive. And the whole conversation about 'You're still alive, she said.' And his doubts: 'Do I deserve to be? Is that the question?' Because he's fucked up forever! So now he doesn't know how to deal with it, so what does he do, he goes out killing people – that was [the song] 'Once.' He becomes a serial killer. And 'Footsteps,' the final song of the trilogy [it was released as a U.K. B side to 'Jeremy'], that's when he gets executed. That's what happens. The Green River killer . . . and in San Diego, there was another prostitute killer down there. Somehow I related to that. I think that happens more than we know. It's a modern way of dealing with a bad life."

Then he smiles as he says, "I'm just glad I became a songwriter."


Sitting next to Vedder, Ament listens like a fascinated brother. Perhaps he is remembering the first impressions Vedder made upon arriving in Seattle. Friends from his early days up north recall a different Vedder from today, a desperately shy surfer, a guy with a lot of heart and little irony. One friend even called him Holy Eddie. "He was genuinely quiet and loving Eddie when we first met him," says Ament. In the band's earliest shows, Vedder had been so self-effacing, he barely looked up. "And at a certain point, he changed."

An early turning point came onstage at a club called Harpo's, in Victoria, British Columbia. It was Pearl Jam's maiden tour, their first appearance away from a nurturing audience of Seattle friends. But this Canadian crowd was far more interested in getting drunk. In midset, Vedder decided to challenge the jaded audience, to wake them up. Unscrewing the 12-pound steel base of the microphone stand, Vedder sent it flying over their heads, like a lethal Frisbee. The steel disk crashed into the wall of the back bar.

They woke up.

Vedder would never fully be the same. Gossard credits the influence of Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, who had asked Vedder to sing on his tribute to Andrew Wood, Temple of the Dog. "Cornell had already transformed himself in an intense way," Gossard says. "Eddie looked to him as a guide to help us through that time."

Vedder soon developed a new stage habit. He began climbing the stage scaffolding or the wings of the theaters the band was playing, falling into the hands of an often worshipful crowd. "I think the first time I got really worried, we were in Texas," recalls McCready. "Eddie climbed up on this girder, about 50 feet in the air. Nobody knew where he was. And all of a sudden you look up – some guy had a flashlight on him – and it was like 'Fuck!' He's up there clinging to a girder. I'm thinking, 'This guy is insane, but I'm so totally pumped.' "

"That whole thing almost turned into a circus event," adds Ament. "People weren't looking at his eyes when he was doing that. I think they were looking at the fucking freak, you know. The guy who was dumb enough to put his life on the line. Evel Knievel. But if you looked at his eyes, man, there was an intensity in what he was doing. That was his belief in himself. He was saying, 'This isn't just "rock" to me.' "

The band returned from a European tour and taped a stirring edition of Unplugged. There was a particularly galvanizing, unforgettable moment at the end of "Black." "We belong . . . together . . . together," Vedder sang. It was simple, a guy sitting on a stool, ripping his heart out, drowning emotionally, right there in front of you. After Unplugged, letters to the band's Ten Club almost doubled, many were about "Black," and they began in an eerily similar fashion: "I was recently considering suicide, and then I heard your music. . . ."

Vedder answered many of the letters himself, sometimes leaving the band's office in a wreck. But there was more work to be done. Almost immediately, the band returned to Europe to play some of the big summer festivals in front of 30,000 to 50,000 people. It was trial by fire.

"The whole thing culminated in Denmark," says Ament. "The Danish, I think, were playing Italy in the World Cup, so the city was crazed. Nirvana was playing there, and they were dealing with their fame, too. We played the show in front of 70,000 people. Eddie went into the crowd, like he usually does, and he came back, and the security didn't know who he was. They started beating him up. Half the band went down. This was during 'Deep.' I remember we stopped, and I was ready to jump down, seeing this total riot happen . . . and Eddie and Eric [Johnson, tour manager], they're totally swinging. And Mike's down there, and Dave's down there."

The previous night in Stockholm, Sweden, Vedder explains, the band had played a longer show than usual. A group of Americans had reportedly broken into the dressing room and, among other things, stolen Vedder's lyrics and journals. He had intended to give them away at the end of the tour, just as he'd done on an earlier European visit (with a backpack personalized by handwritten accounts of each show). But the theft weighed on him; it felt like a breach of trust, a bad omen. For Vedder, it was a metaphor for the growing success of Pearl Jam. The band about which Ament had once written, "Add water, watch Pearl Jam grow," was growing wildly, far beyond the small-scale plans for a small-scale debut. "It made us feel like playing those huge shows maybe wasn't as important as we thought it was," says Ament. "We packed our bags, and we left the next morning."

Sitting in the Nightlite, Ament and Vedder recall the bruising end to that 1991 tour. The band had seen their unassuming debut album, Ten, sell into the millions. Only Billy Ray Cyrus had kept them from the No. 1 slot, thankfully saving at least one achievement for later. Pearl Jam had been designed for a slow build. Instead, they were strapped to the rocket. The band held numerous meetings: "Where do we draw the line?"

The line was drawn at "Black." Eddie Vedder refused to turn the song into a video, wouldn't listen to the corporate coaching that told him the track was, as Vedder puts it, "bigger than 'Jeremy', bigger than you or me." Vedder held firm, and the band backed him up.

"Some songs," he says, "just aren't meant to be played between Hit No. 2 and Hit No. 3. You start doing those things, you'll crush it. That's not why we wrote songs. We didn't write to make hits. But those fragile songs get crushed by the business. I don't want to be a part of it. I don't think the band wants to be part of it."

The subject soon turns to video, and Ament describes a recent encounter with Mark Eitzel from the group American Music Club. Ament and McCready jammed with the band in Seattle, but within 30 seconds of conversation, Eitzel took the opportunity to challenge Ament on the "Jeremy" video. "I liked your hit," he'd told Ament, co-author of the song, "but the video sucked. It ruined my vision of the song."

The exchange stuck with Ament. "Ten years from now," he tells Vedder, "I don't want people to remember our songs as videos."

Vedder agrees. He promises that the new album will be released before any videos. "I don't even have MTV," he says with a shrug. "I don't know why I'm commenting. People stop me in the streets and tell me about this band Stone Temple Pilots. I don't even know who they are. I'm buying a sandwich, and they go, 'What's going on with the Stone Temple Pilots?' "

"You haven't seen the video?" asks Ament. "You have to have seen it."

"I haven't," he says. "I don't have MTV."

Ament tells Vedder about the "Plush" video, with the singer's uncanny appropriation of Vedder's mannerisms. Vedder's heard it before. In fact, he hears it daily. From fans, from friends, even from a French musician who complimented him on the song and his new short orange hair. (Vedder's hair is still longish and brown.)

"Apparently, it's something that the guy is dealing with, too," Vedder suggests. "It's like, am I supposed to feel sympathy? Get your own trip, man. I don't think I was copping anybody's trip. I wasn't copping Andy Wood's trip. I wasn't copping Kurt Cobain's trip, even though Kurt Cobain's one of the best trips I could ever cop. But Beth and I were part of the San Diego scene. We knew everything that was going on, and it was small enough to know. Those guys came from there? I never heard of 'em." End of subject.

For several more hours, Vedder and Ament reminisce over the strange daze of the last few years. Vedder admits to Ament that it's no longer as easy, the stage appearances are tougher now. It's harder, he says, to gear up to sing the songs the way that they must be sung. And although Vedder is only an occasional drinker, he has taken to slugging at a bottle of red wine onstage. When the conversation turns to the late Andrew Wood, though, Vedder becomes reflective.

"I wonder about Andy," he says. "I relate sometimes. Not the drug part – I don't need drugs to make my life tragic – but the fact that things were going so well for him. He didn't know." Vedder pauses. "There's one song of his that I'd be proud to sing. I won't tell you which one. But there was one song of his that always got to me. Someday I'm going to sing it."

Vedder excuses himself to visit the restroom. Ament shakes his head. "First time I heard that," he says with a private smile.

It's 2 a.m. now, a chilly night in June. Ament and Vedder stand shivering on the corner outside the Moore Theater. Neither seems anxious for the night to end. Fingering their car keys, they continue talking under the darkened marquee. Tonight is Grad Night in Seattle. Last-call barflies and late-night prom couples brush past them on the street, no one recognizing the two musicians, save for one woozy grad in a crimson tuxedo. For a few minutes, he stands watching them from nearby, softly repeating a drunken mantra to himself. "Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie," he says and then moves on.

"I don't know if it was the beer or the company or what," Ament remarks, "but I got to a place tonight I hadn't been in a long time."

"Me, too," says Vedder. "So much has changed around here."

"There's going to be a point where it'll revert back to the way that it was," says Ament. "We'll get through this whole period right now. We'll get back out there, playing. We'll get back to actually being five guys who want to work it out together."

Vedder thrusts his hands deep into his pockets. "I'd really like that," he says.

The two band mates stand in the dark for another 10 minutes, talking about Oliver Stone, about Reservoir Dogs, about attitudes in the band and sexism on the road, about their pride in the new songs and about Vedder's ultimate meltdown plan. He can always sell solo cassettes out of his house for $1.50. Finally the cold overtakes them.

"See you tomorrow," says Ament, heading for the parking lot across the street.

"Wait," says Vedder, "I'll go with you."


"Fuck you," yells a chorus of fans near the front.

There is little poetry in the Italian crowd. Forty thousand fill this Roman soccer stadium today, but there isn't much they're interested in seeing outside of the group on the ticket – U2.

"Fuck me?" repeats Vedder, out on the lip of the stage. "Tell you what – you fuck me, and Bono will fuck you!"

The band launches into "Even Flow" and attempts to build a consensus, good or bad, anything. The struggle for acceptance ends in a draw. This is one of the few countries in the world not to have fallen under the Pearl Jam spell, and the band feels the chill in its first of two shows opening for U2's Zooropa '93 road extravaganza. It would be easy to write this audience off as lackadaisical, but within seconds of leaving the stage, the Zooropa DJ spins Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust," and the entire stadium thunders along in beat, instantly.

Back in the dressing room, the band mills about, somberly picking at food. Abbruzzese already has a game plan for tomorrow: "I'm gonna lower the drum riser so I can see the audience. I'm gonna connect with those people."

Within a few minutes, Vedder emerges upbeat and finds some American fans. "I wish we'd played a club here," he tells them, signing some shirts. He and Beth Liebling head out to the mixing platform to watch U2 with the rest of the band. Before long, a cluster of super- and semi-supermodels position themselves just behind him, clucking and whooping, taking pictures, trying to get his attention. Vedder remains fixed on the spectacle ahead. Finally one of the models manages an introduction to him. She speaks earnestly to him, shaking his hand. Vedder nods politely, turning back to the show. Total time investment – three seconds.

Later the band rides the tour bus back to the hotel. Stuck in traffic, a crowd of Italian fans discovers the bus and strains to look inside. Their expression is unmistakable. "Oh," they seem to say, "it's the other band." But still they stare, as if looking inside a fishbowl. "Wish we'd played a club date here," says Vedder to no one in particular.

The conversation turns to Neil Young and the upcoming show with him in Dublin, Ireland. The band is soon talking about its next chance to jam with Young on "Rockin' in the Free World." But even this venerable topic is soon exhausted. And still the Roman faces stare inside the windows of the stalled bus. It's unsettling. It is as if Zoo TV has gone off the air, and the test pattern is Pearl Jam.

Until about a month before release, the album was going to be titled Five Against One. The name comes up during a meeting in a hotel room in Rome as the band approves the final mixes of the record. There are already rumblings from the record company. Can you raise Eddie's vocals? And there is the issue of video. Can we get a decision on a director? And the press interviews. You gotta do some. The answers to the questions are Not really, No and Later. Decisions swirl around them hourly, but Pearl Jam are intent on doing it their own way. The album title feels appropriate. The phrase comes from a new song, "Animal."

"For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record," says Gossard, who picked out the phrase. "Your own independence – your own soul – versus everybody else's. In this band, and I think in rock in general, the art of compromise is almost as important as the art of individual expression. You might have five great artists in the band, but if they can't compromise and work together, you don't have a great band. It might mean something completely different to Eddie. But when I heard that lyric, it made a lot of sense to me."

It's now Day 2 in Rome. Vedder sits at the top of the stadium bleachers on this blazingly hot afternoon in July. He wears a tourist shirt that says I ♥ GRUNGE. He is rather anonymous in this country, and it agrees with him. "The whole success thing, I feel like everybody else in the band is a lot happier with it than me," he says. "Happy-go-lucky. They kind of roll with it. They enjoy it, even. I can't seem to do that. It's not that I think I'm better than it. I don't know. I'm just not that happy a person." He shrugs. "I'm just not. What I enjoy is seeing music, getting to watch. Watching Neil Young. Or I get to watch Sonic Youth from the side of the stage. That's what's been nice for me.

"Music is an incredibly powerful medium to deliver a story by. But the best thing is, you have to have volume. You're supposed to play it loud. I would do anything to be around music. You don't even have to pay me."

Vedder confesses having some recent difficulties in writing for Pearl Jam. As Gossard had pointed out earlier, the other band members now call him their spokesperson, and with that comes a certain Eddie ethic. Vedder works hard with manager Kelly Curtis to keep ticket prices low and to police the powerful promotion machine of Sony Music. But therein lies the grand contradiction. The artists he most admires are the very ones who have turned their backs on the machinery of big-time rock – like Henry Rollins and Ian MacKaye of Fugazi.

And Vedder, the guy who never slept, still doesn't sleep. "Never have," he says. "Never have, and now I really don't. I have that spasm thing. I wake up and go, 'Aaarrrgh.' I'll get up and start pacing. I'll walk through a room, and the TV's on, and my face is on, and I start to freak out. I want to call a friend and say: 'Did I lose my mind? I need perspective.' I talked with Henry Rollins one day. I said, 'Dude, I need some perspective real quick.' And I really felt bad doing it. Because I was calling him up for the same reason kids call me up."

You wonder, of course, if this is all part of Vedder's elaborate defense mechanism. How can you attack the man who attacks himself? How can you doubt the credibility of a man who won an MTV Video Award for "Jeremy" and then told 50 million viewers, "If it wasn't for music, I would have shot myself in front of that classroom." For all his open-wound honesty, there are many mysteries that Vedder still clings to. Even a close band mate like McCready says: "No, I don't know if we've ever had that big, bonding talk yet. Our relationship is still growing. We'll probably have it sometime soon."

Asked about his childhood, Vedder plays it close to his chest. He tells an anecdote about waiting tables back in Chicago. He tells of moving to San Diego and buying beanbag chairs and his first bad stereo. He tells of bootlegging shows, something he still does with a pocket-size microrecorder. All perfect sound bites for populist myth making, but when confronted with questions about his childhood, Vedder becomes vague. Of his earliest memories, he says only: "I'm confused. I'm mixed up about everything. I don't know what's happening now."

He still answers fan mail, though less frequently, and tour manager Eric Johnson sometimes visits the Seattle office late at night to find Vedder calling back troubled fans. But as Vedder had carefully told one fan in San Francisco after a show: "I'm really not in your head, I'm not thinking all your private thoughts." The fan had looked so disappointed. Vedder, in turn, has learned the public effect of writing well about damaged personalities.

"I was surprised and a little upset that so many people did relate," says Vedder. "Everyone's fucked up. Actually, now I understand those religious channels more. Everybody needs something." He pauses for a long time. "There should be no messiahs in music. The music itself, the music, I don't mind worshipping that. I've done that. And with that comes a little bit of admiration for the people who make it – or awe or whatever – but I never asked for nose hair from Pete Townshend."

Back in Rome, on the second day, Pearl Jam offer a combative performance. "I'll meet you back here at a club next time," Vedder says, to sprinkled applause. Later, he begins to goad them, telling them their stadium was built for soccer, not music. And below a neon Zoo TV sign, he playfully taunts further: "Are we animals?" Let it never be said that Vedder doesn't enjoy the fine taste of the hand feeding him. His green T-shirt contains today's gaffer-taped message: Paul is Dead. (Look up Bono's real name.) The set closes with Vedder donning a huge fly mask, dancing as if caught in a web. It is Pearl Jam's own lo-fi answer to Zoo TV. Not many fans here get it, but one who does is Bono, who watches curiously from the pit.

Bono responds later that night, onstage. "So you can't play music in a soccer stadium," he muses. "Well, if you do, it better be good music. . . ." But before the set is over, he hails Pearl Jam as "a great rock & roll band." And Vedder, Liebling and Ament will stay up all night with Bono and the Edge, talking passionately in a diner, debating the issue of the day, the emotional exchange rate on success. And at 6 a.m., there are Vedder and Ament exchanging hugs with Bono on an empty Roman street, arriving at the bus just in time for the trip to Dublin.

"I got all my questions answered," Ament confides. In the course of the dates with U2, he had discussed the hugeness vs. purity issue with all four members of that band. "And they basically told us this: 'We used to be like you. We used to be anti-anti. . . . We used to be angry. But we love technology, like you love what you love. Next tour we might only play 3,000- seat halls. But this is where we are today. Ten years from now, you tell us where you are.' "


Today in Dublin, the day before Peal Jam play for an estimated 50,000 at nearby Slane Castle, Abbruzzese stands and watches as 30 or so young Dubliners sing resolutely to street-busking versions of "Black" and "State of Love and Trust." Abbruzzese is grinning, handing out flowers on Grafton Street, playing with street kids. Gone is the bleachy sunshine of Italy. In its place is rain . . . pale faces . . . romantic beery arguments in the street . . . it feels like home.

Elsewhere, there are rumors that McCready has fallen off the wagon, running naked through the streets of Dublin late the night before. McCready, shopping for bootleg tapes today, does not confirm or deny this behind his reflector shades. "I love this place," he says.

Backstage the next day at the show, there are few of the trappings of big-time rock. No open bar, no stereo rack pumping psych-up music, no bodyguards, no supermodels. Just Vedder talking about why he couldn't care less.

"I'm embarrassed for some of the 'veterans' of music," he says. "They had their original [macho] image, and they're still hanging on to it. The sex thing, they're still working it. This-dude-looks-like-your-grandpa kind of thing – it's so silly, it kinda makes you sick. These guys are still using that ancient version of what's sexy, the bikinis and tongues. It's over. I relate to the people that are coming up now, and that's not there, that's long gone."

Vedder's relationship with Liebling, a writer, is the strongest one in his life. They've been together nine years. Perhaps soon, he says, they'll be married. And when it's time to start a family, he predicts he'll be a devoted parent. He cites Michael Jordan's father, then still alive, as a perfect example. "The ultimate parent is, if they've made a decision to have kids, that means they're going to give someone else a chance, and they're going to do whatever they can to boost that kid up so he can really shine," he says. "I feel like, in the last 20 years, that's been drained out of parenthood. I'm into real life. I'm into getting the most out of real life."

Sitting now in the shadow of the 200-year-old Slane Castle, the hazy sun shining on his face, Vedder is asked about his own youth. What about his father?

"I never knew my real dad," he says. "I had another father that I didn't get along with, a guy I thought was my father. There were fights and bad, bad scenes. I was kind of on my own at a pretty young age. I never finished high school."

He was Eddie Mueller then. After moving briefly to San Diego, both his parents had returned to Chicago. Vedder, who subsequently took his mother's maiden name, had stayed behind to pursue his career in music. There was a rough goodbye to his stepfather. They haven't spoken since. Later, Vedder was living in San Diego when his mother visited from Chicago with some important news for him.

"She came out with the specific purpose," he says, "to tell me that this guy wasn't my father. I remember at the time I was like 'I know he's not my father, he's a fucking asshole.' And she said, 'Oh, Eddie, he's really not your father.'

"At first I was pretty happy about it, then she told me who my real dad was. I had met the guy three or four times, he was a friend of the family, kind of a distant friend. He died of multiple sclerosis. So when I met him, he was in the hospital. He had crutches, or maybe he was in a wheelchair."

Vedder plays with his ripped-out shoe. Somehow, a half-world away, the words flow easily as he recalls, as he puts it, "the day I found out."

"There was a piano in the room," he goes on, "and I remember really wishing I knew how to play a happy song. I was happy for about a minute, and then I came down. I had to deal with the fact that he was dead. My real father was not on this earth. I had to deal with the anger of not being told sooner, not being told while he was alive. I was a big secret. Secrets are bad news. Secrets about adoption, any of that stuff. It's got to come out, don't keep it. It just gets bigger and darker and deeper and uglier and messy.

"Musically, I tried to think if I had a goal, what it was, and I think more than anything it was to leave something for my kid, if I had one, to listen to. I'm actually a junior. My real name is something-something the third." Fans can find it in the song credits to "Alive," on Ten.

Vedder's biological father, it turned out, was a musician himself, an organist-vocalist who sang in restaurants. Once Vedder knew the truth about his heritage, other relatives stepped forward.

"There were all these things they wanted to say," he recalls, "like 'That's where you got musical talent,' and I was like 'Fuck you.' At the time, I was 14 or 15, I didn't even know what the fuck was going on. I learned how to play guitar, saved all my money for equipment, and you're telling me that's where it came from? Some fucking broken-down old lounge act? Fuck you."

Vedder says this quietly, but time has barely mellowed his emotions. It's no surprise that Quadrophenia, the Who's 1973 classic tale of disaffected English youth, was Vedder's Catcher in the Rye. (He once told an interviewer, "I should be sending Pete Townshend cards for Father's Day.") Music saved his life, he says, but the turbulence of Vedder's youth still fuels the music. It's a painful circle. "My folks are very proud of me now," he says. "And again, I'm thankful that they've given me a lifetime's worth of material to write about."

(Recently, a meeting with his real father's cousin left Vedder with a sense of closure. "The strange thing," he says, "is that there are so many similarities between my father and I. He had no impact on my life, but here I am. I look just like him. People in my family – they can't help it – they look at me like I'm a replacement. That's where 'Alive' comes in." He pauses. "But I'm proud of the guy now. I appreciate my heritage. I have a very deep feeling for him in my heart.")

Have fun with it. You hear the phrase often around Vedder. He rarely has a response. Have fun with it. Certainly, his rock dreams are coming true: to sing "Masters of War" at the Bob Dylan tribute concert last year, to sing with the Doors at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and to finally meet his hero Pete Townshend. But to have fun with it, it seems, would put him one step closer to those rock stars in the magazines, the ones flipping their hair, the ones who caused him to write Pearl Jam's defining statement in "Blood" – "It's my bloooood."

It's way too late to be Fugazi, and Vedder knows it. Still, Pearl Jam offer fans a challenge: Bootleg us if you can, take our album, pass the music around, don't glorify us. Vedder long ago traded away the brown thrift-store jacket given him by Gossard, the one remade and marketed by the fashion industry as a $1,000 piece of grunge wear. The band no longer condones stage diving for safety reasons, and even Vedder's scaffold climbing appears to be history. He offers an interesting perspective:

"That climbing happened out of me saying: 'Look, this is how extreme I feel about this situation. This is how fucking intense I'm taking this moment.' You can't do that for long, because what they really want to see is, they want you to chop your fucking arm off, hold up your arm, wave it around spewing blood, and believe me, if you did that, the crowd would go fucking ballistic. You only get four good shows like that, though. Four good shows, and then you're just a torso and a head, trying to get one of your band mates to give you one last hurrah and chop your head off. Which they probably wouldn't do, which would really be hell.

"But," Vedder says with a laugh, "they'd say, 'Sing from your diaphragm, at least you still have that going for you.' "

The Dublin audience is fierce, awake, fueled by anger and ale. Van Morrison performs to the hometown crowd, and he is greeted like a beloved uncle. He is offstage only a few minutes before the audience, in anticipation of Pearl Jam, surges to the front. "I love some kind of pressure in the air," says McCready, peering out at the boiling mass of Irish fans. "Some kind of weirdness in the crowd, good or bad. That's what we thrive on."

Pearl Jam take the stage, and the crowd packs closer, straining the barriers. It's brutal down in front, and security is already pulling the semiconscious out one by one, before a note is even played. Vedder walks on in a gorilla mask, pulls it off and hurls himself into "Why Go."

It is a crowd happily perched on the edge of danger, and today they get the best out of Pearl Jam. Onstage, the band is narrowly missing each other as they all, in different ways, leap for joy, pogoing and twirling, just missing each other's skulls with the instruments. The volatile crowd does not scare Vedder; he's seriously singing to those serious faces listening to him the way he listened to the Who – with their whole lives attached. He stands on the edge of the stage, just watching them, and turns to share it with Liebling, who catches it all on Super 8.

It's the show they've been waiting for, a glimpse of the future. "If it all ends tomorrow," Abbruzzese says, "I will be the happiest fucking gas-station attendant you ever saw."

Best of all, Pearl Jam are no longer a band with only one very, very big album to their credit. "There's no school to go to for some of the weird shit that happens," says Vedder. "The fucking weirdness of it all. But some of these guys, they can help out a bit. Bob Dylan's advice was 'Go to Dublin.' I wrote him a postcard today.

"It said, 'Made it.' "

ndy's dead" the voice said flatly, It sounded so unlike my old friend Kelly, this dispassionate monotone on the answering machine. Kelly was one of the most excitable guys I knew. In recent years he'd become a rock manager, guiding the career of a fledgling seattle band named Mother Love Bone. It's lead singer and frontman, Andy Wood, had been successfully battling a nagging heroin problem. But the night before Wood was to meet his boyhood idols Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons of Kiss, he'd scored some deadly heroin on the street. They found him comatose in his apartment, his favorite T-shirt mysteriously ripped to pieces in the washer. After several days on a life-support machine, Andy Wood slipped away."I'm still at the hospital," Kelly said with a sad sigh. "I'll be at home later."

My wife and I stared at the answering machine. Within a few minutes, we'd psychoanalyzed Kelly's voice. He was in trouble. No, worse, he was a ticking time bomb. He needed help. He needed friendship. We got in the car and drove to his house – immediately.

Rounding the corner to Kelly's place, it was obvious that his other friends had the same idea. Cars lined the streets. Inside the small house were Andy Wood's friends, his band mates, members of other bands from throughout the city. The same odd look on all their faces – I've never had a close friend die before. And still they kept arriving, these dazed Seattle musicians – a breed all their own, the inspired children of pro basketball and Cheap Trick and Led Zeppelin and Black Flag and Kiss.

I was thirty-two at the time and felt a part of something. Somewhere around midnight, warming over a barbecue pit, I felt rocked by the whole experience. I'd been working pretty steadily since I was fifteen, and looking back, most of my friends were made through work. They were acquaintances more than friends. And here were these disconnected single people, many from broken homes, many meeting each other for the first time, forming their own family. In the coming years, many of the musicians in that room would see success far beyond their early dreams, beyond even the arena dreams of Andy Wood. But that night it was mostly about staying warm, pulling together. It was almost instinctual. And I thought about Los Angeles, where musicians would already have slipped audition tapes into Kelly's pocket.

I was in the process of rewriting an old script of mine at the time. It was called Singles, and that night it took a different course. I wanted to write something that captured the feeling in that room. Not Andy's story but the story of how people instinctively need to be together. Is anybody truly single? I knew I'd soon be rewriting the rewrite of my script, and I knew I had to direct it, too.

Three years later, Singles is a movie in the can. It's the story of six Seattle urbanites, their lives in and around the apartment complex where they reside. A lot of the music was provided by local musicians and bands, but contrary to some advance reports, it's not a movie about the birth of the now-hot Seattle scene or even the story of how Mother Love Bone gained a new singer (Eddie Vedder) and became Pearl Jam. It's the story of disconnected single people making their way, forming their own unspoken family. Everything about the movie screamed obsession. Making it in Seattle became an obsession. Getting it perfect became an obsession. And early on, I started obsessively keeping a journal.

Looking at the stacks of pages of diaries, I feel like the guy on The Outer Limits who revisits the home he lived in 300 years earlier. Printed journals often have a self-serving sheen over them. Like bad date talk, they're often a laundered version of reality. I wanted this to be different. Some of my earliest reading pleasures were Pete Townshend's 1970-71 essays in Rolling Stone about his work with the Who. His writing gave me the feeling that he was sending a letter to a friend, and in drat spirit, I wanted to keep a running account of Singles.

Some nights making the movie, I'd write for an hour, other times only a few minutes. (One entry reads only: "Aaaaaaaaagh!") These raw, nocturnal entries were more like a cleansing ritual than a guide to intelligent filmmaking. To anyone offended, please know that I intend to offend myself as well. So for whatever reasons, perhaps in the spirit of preventing you at home from developing a need to write and direct a collagelike movie with eighty-seven speaking parts, I present this to you now.

10-15-90: Campbell Scott will play the part of Steve Dunne, the traffic engineer at the center of Singles. Everything is exploding at once for Campbell. Today he got the part opposite Julia Roberts in Dying Young. He's playing a leukemia victim who falls in love with his nurse. A problem surfaces – in Dying Young he loses his hair. Many nervous calls are traded between our movie and Dying Young. Toward the end of the day, it's resolved. Dying Young will not actually cut his hair; he'll wear a bald cap with a wig over it. Whew.

2-24-91: Campbell has arrived in Seattle. We meet for dinner. His hair is very, very short. He is pale. He looks like a leukemia victim. Sitting in a dark restaurant, my early fears slip away. We'll do something about his hair. Campbell is psyched to play the part of Steve. We're in sync. I raise a toast. "Don't jinx it," he says.

2-25-91: First day of rehearsal goes smoothly. We blast through the scenes. Kyra Sedgwick and Campbell Scott have a nice chemistry together. Around lunch time, we step out into the daylight I see problems. Campbell still looks like a leukemia victim. We still have two weeks. What kind of vitamins make hair grow?

Today, Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon arrive in town. Matt, who will play a Seattle musician named Cliff Poncier, has already spent time in New York with Mother Love Bone's Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard and their intensely shy new lead singer, Eddie Vedder. Their new band is called Mookie Blaylock, after the New Jersey Nets basketball player. [Later they're renamed Pearl Jam] In the movie, they will play Cliff's fictional band, Citizen Dick. Matt has already got a lead singer's walk down – all attitude, chest puffed slightly out. I wanted rehearsals to begin weeks early so the cast could soak up the local atmosphere and the music.

Tonight we go to see Mookie Blaylock and Alice in Chains performing at the Off Ramp. The cast meets for the first rime in the lobby of our hotel. For a few minutes, nobody says much. ("I hope this isn't a yuppie movie," Matt announces, picking an odd conversation opener.) We go to the club. It's sweaty and packed, and the cast slowly makes friends as we sit in a corner booth.

2-27-91: We read through the script today, and it sounds good. Afterward, the cast hangs around in my office, with downtown Seattle as a backdrop. They've become friends. Six months of casting is paying off. It's still mind-bending, though, to see the characters you've written sitting around and talking in character.

3-1-91: Campbell's hair is shaped. It's like shortening the legs of a table. In the process, more is mistakenly cut.

3-9-91: Campbell's hair is becoming a flash point. I sense he's picking up on it. Rehearsals fall apart.

3-10-91: Nancy [my wife] tells me I talked continuously in my sleep. "Sick hair," I said, over and over.

3-11-91: Kyra is in the first scene, and she's like clockwork; she's excellent. We have a celebratory lunch with the cast – except for Campbell, who has disappeared.

3-12-91: Campbell shows up this morning to report that he married his longtime girlfriend Anne over the weekend. What a way to start a movie called Singles.

3-13-91: No sleep. Warner Bros. sees the dailies. "Campbell Scott looks sick," they say.

3-14-91: I'm keeping the studio's panic from Campbell, but he senses something is wrong. He's starting to make odd cracks and barbed jokes; they fire in every direction. It's getting under my skin. I take him aside and ask him what the problem is. He is instantly apologetic."It's my sense of humor," he says. Later in the day, a WB executive calls and suggests replacing him. I stand by Campbell and hope for sun and speedy hair growth.

3-17-91: I call Campbell and suggest a wig. He takes it well, but just beneath the surface I feel his angst. I admire actors; it can't be easy approximating real life with a huge, glowing camera in your face.

3-18-91: Jim True, the celebrated stage actor from Chicago, is loose and funny as the maitre d' and amateur Francophile named David Bailey. True has had tough luck in movies. His performances in smaller parts were trimmed from The Accidental Tourist and Fat Man and Little Boy. It will not happen in this movie.

Campbell says there is a wig he wore for a photo in Dying Young. It looked very realistic. Calls go out: Get that wig. In the meantime, he finds a strange long-haired wig on the set and casually strolls around wearing it. His self-effacing move defuses the pressure. He wins everybody over. What a roller coaster.

3-22-91: The Dying Young wig arrives. Campbell and I work on his look in the hair-and-makeup trailer. Nobody is allowed to see him. Finally, when the wig is right, we test it out. Seattle actor Johnny "Sugarbear" Willis arrives for a small role and, knowing nothing of the hair crisis, tromps into the trailer. He chats with us for five minutes about crab fishing. We seem to be getting away with it. Then Johnny leans forward, eyeing Campbell carefully. "That is not your hair, man," he says.

I meet Campbell out in the hallway and tell him we're going to go with his real hair, shortness be damned. Back to the trailer we go. In the three days we've taken to find his wig, Campbell's hair has grown just enough to work.

3-27-91: I'm starting to sound like Matt Dillon. It's infectious, his New York jukebox accent. For all his tough-guy parts gone by, he is a loved actor on the street. Strangers tell him they're "chillin' like Matt Dillon." He takes it all in with a bemused grin. He was slow to commit to the part of Cliff Poncier, but now he's here, and it feels right. Walking around the set in his Green River T-shirt, he looks perfect. A dedicated music fan, his trailer blasts with Tyrone Davis, the Replacements and the Clash. He's brimming with ideas.

"I love Bridget," Matt says several times today. "I'm in love with her." I drink he means it. He's anxious to play a reversal on the usual romantic male lead. In this movie, he will pursue the girl. ("And I don't want to smoke; I see my old movies, and I'm always smoking.") He's almost always dead-on with his first take, and if he isn't, somewhere around take 5 he might disappear around a corner. Then you might hear the sound of someone slugging a wall with his fist. Returning with laserlike concentration, Dillon's next take is usually perfect. His knuckles are bulky reminders that he's been acting almost nonstop since he was fourteen. "Sometimes I'm hard on myself" he says. "No big deal."

3-31-91: Easter, a day off. I look out the window at the water, and the sky goes blue. Two things about Seattle: One, this whole town is jacked on coffee, and two, on the right day it looks like the cover of Houses of the Holy.

4-1-91: The Bridget Fonda phase of filming is kicking in. She plays Janet Livermore, the architecture student killing time in an espresso job. Janet is in love with love, and I wrote the part for Bridget. For months, in person or on the telephone, we've discussed every aspect of Singles. Like a dry young Barbara Stanwyck, she nailed down every small detail of Janet's life. Seeing her finally do the part, I realize she's deceptively low-ball. From three feet away, it appears like she's not even acting. Seeing the same thing on film the next day, she explodes.

The dialogue involves the love-struck Janet trying to figure how and why Cliff could be less than electrified by her. Very directly, she asks him a private question: "Are my breasts too small for you?" In the script, it was surprising and funny. As performed by Matt and Bridget, it's achingly real.

4-4-91: Tonight the studio calls to say the movie is getting serious. This is probably not a compliment.

4-8-91: "Kyra is in tears," says the production assistant. In her trailer, Kyra confesses that she's not sure how she's doing playing Linda. Haven't I been telling her all along? "Yes," she says, "but you're so enthusiastic that when you get quiet, I get worried." She's right, of course. I have been quiet. My working relationship with Campbell is deteriorating daily. The air is thick with the unspoken. I know it's not easy for him. Steve Dunne is the hardest part in the movie. All around him are characters with odd and interesting quirks. His is the Curse of the Normal Guy.

4-9-91: The day ends with the last scene of the movie – Matt and Bridget alone in the elevator. It's a romantic scene, and it has some intricate timing. We film it fourteen times. Between takes, Bridget pluckily explains that kissing scenes are much easier when she actually likes the guy. "He's a sweetheart," she says of Matt.

4-10-91: Finally, the confrontation with Campbell. The hostile humor is creeping into his performance. "And who are you?" he says, when I try to talk with him. I am mystified again by human behavior, even as I stand here trying to direct a movie about the mysteries of human behavior. A few minutes later, while the camera is rolling, Campbell cavalierly flips off camera assistant Shawn Hise as he snaps the slate. (Shawn looks wounded; he's a Campbell fan.) That's it. I take him aside and tell him again to knock off the endless sarcasm. Campbell goes off, his voice booming. He's pissed off at the way actors are treated. He wants me to understand him. He wants actors everywhere to be understood. The sheer volume of his voice is astounding. And then it sort of sinks in . . . He's yelling at me. I cut loose myself. I start yelling at him. It's freeing, and he backs down. In fact, he seems grateful. Now we just want to make friends again, like two guys who just had a fender bender and, their hearts racing, have to bond over the crisis. He tells me he respects me, he thinks I'm a great writer. Pointedly, as thirty waiting crew members pretend they're not listening, he doesn't add the occupation I'm currently pursuing – directing. Maybe I'll just be a writer. This part of it, when blood is in the water, is not my favorite.

4-11-91: Mark Arm from Mudhoney brings Sonic Youth to the set. They arrive on an important day. Today is the French Club scene. It has been the target of countless assassination attempts in story meetings at the studio. ("Take it out. It'll never end up in the movie.") The scene survives because they are wrong. Proudly, I collar [Sonic Youth guitarist] Thurston Moore. For some reason, I feel the need to explain the French Club scene to him in great detail. He nods courteously. His eyes glaze. Thurston invites us all to their big concert tonight with Neil Young. Can't wait for this show.

4-12-91: Passed out in the hotel and missed the show.

4-19-91: This movie is a freight train. Eric Stoltz has joined us for a few days. During Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Stoltz once promised to be in "everything you ever write." In Singles he plays a Bitter Mime. Typically, he is twisted and savagely funny in the part. Stoltz and Bridget are a couple in real life, they're good together, their relationship seems destined for a life outside of news photos.

It's a loose and goofy night, and we finish a ton of work. By 4:00 a.m., Campbell, Eric Stoltz and I are doing Michael Bolton impressions. Bolton sings Zeppelin. Bolton sings Guns n' Roses. We are all so tired that just the word – Bolton – sends us into hysterics.

4-22-91: The studio calls and floats a (lead) balloon. Isn't the title Singles "dated"? Isn't there a popular song that would be better? I hope this issue goes away. Jeff Ament comes to the set at lunch time with the first rehearsal tape of potential songs for the movie. Mookie Blaylock is now Pearl Jam. The first song, "State of Love and Trust," is ferocious. It's about battling with your instincts in love (". . . help me from myself . . ."). Somehow it matches the movie-in-progress. The tape contains four other new Pearl Jam songs. A little over a year after losing Andy Wood, Ament walks with quiet pride. Like maybe lightning is striking twice.

4-28-91: We film Alice in Chains playing live at the underground club Desoto. It's a boost. I can't tell you much about the precise filmic style of John Ford's westerns, but I can tell you about the pure emotional perfection of Todd Rundgren's Hermit of Mink Hollow or the Replacements' Tim, Mother Love Bone's "Crown of Thorns" or even the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. To get that feeling watching Singles, that would be something.

4-30-91: The Car Crash scene goes well. Today I overhear two grips having a conversation about me on the radio-mike headset. I hear that I look especially happy today, that I must have gotten laid last night and that after all the talky scenes it was great to get out there today and "T-bone that fuckin' car."

5-24-91: Tonight is the wrap party. Extras are starting to get drunk now, telling me how this has been the best time of their lives. Where was I? I feel like I blinked and the whole thing was over. I am proud to have made a movie in which Bridget Fonda shares a scene with the legendary Sub Pop thrash rocker Tad. But now our de facto family is breaking up. Movie-crew people are nomads. They'll go on to three or four more movies, and I'll still be with the child – Singles.

7-23-91: Today is the day we look at the first cut of the movie. It's two hours and forty-five minutes long. Parts are thrilling; parts make me squirm. Back in the editing room with Richard [Chew, our editor] and Art [Linson, executive producer], we attack the problems. Nothing is as funny as we'd hoped. Everything feels long. Oddly enough, I don't feel panicked.

9-9-91: I'm starting to panic. Perspective is slipping away. I'm lucky to have Richard, a careful editor, a protector of characters. Forty minutes have been taken out of the movie. I hope it's the right forty minutes. I know this – the French Club scene is staying in.

10-4-91: I have reached tunnel vision. It's a strange syndrome. All I do is watch Singles. The only people I see are crew people who watch Singles. I want to go out with my wife, maybe to see The Fisher King, but I can't. It's too dangerous. I might feel bad about Singles. I am Bubble Man. All I can see are bona fide classics from another era – which don't count – or very bad contemporary movies. I stay home and watch Elvis in Live a Little, Love a Little, and all is right with the world again.

10-30-91: Whatever cockiness that surfaced, and was deliciously enjoyed, a few months ago is disappearing fast. Every conversation with the studio lately is about the Cards. The future course of this movie will be set by 400 Glendale [California] moviegoers between the ages of seventeen and thirty-four, recruited mostly at malls. They will fill out . . . the Cards. The Cards are then tallied, and the result is what WB is truly after . . . the Numbers.

11-6-91: Today is the first preview. I get a speeding ticket. I'm a mess. I inch toward the preview, feeling very nervous. The movie begins on time; the audience seems to really pay attention. Then, a restlessness sets in. I die with every walkout. I study the way they walk. Are they going to the bathroom? Will they come back? Come back! (Most do.)

The Numbers are average. There is an immediate and powerful desire to point fingers. Typically, I think I've run from the raw emotions in the movie. I went for the jokes. I'm reminded of words I've heard from close friends my whole life: "I don't know when you're kidding and when you're being serious." Tonight, I think it's true of Singles.

11-11-91: I show the movie to a trusted friend, and his reaction is eye opening. "I'm with the movie," he says, "and then something gets lost. You don't ever fully explain why Steve and Linda break up."

11-24-91: It's true. We're still missing a definitive breakup sequence. I've asked WB to let me shoot these new scenes. Since our first preview, I've felt the unmistakable studio chill. It's predictable. WB is in the business of making big, big hits. They are in the rhinoceros business, and I am an ant. It's not us, they seem to say; it's the Numbers. An old friend sees me; he's shocked at my appearance, tells me to get some sleep.

12-7-91: Paul Westerberg records a new song, "Dyslexic Heart," in Los Angeles. It's classic Westerberg, all about love and confusion, and it's the perfect song to end the movie. Elsewhere, Warner Bros. agrees to the shooting of the new breakup sequence.

12-19-91: I agree to take the French Club scene out for one screening.

1-1-92: Soundgarden's Chris Cornell sends in a rich collection of incidental music. This movie takes music like a sponge. For me, Cornell is the very soul of Seattle music and its endearing darkness. I remember him the night Andy Wood died. He put a hand on Jeff Ament's shoulder. "I'm gonna call you tomorrow," Cornell said, angry at the world. "We're gonna ride bikes and fucking smoke cigarettes." It's an odd moment to remember so clearly. Something about it just nailed this city.

1-8-92: Back in Seattle, shooting the new material. Campbell's biggest scene takes place in a pay phone, as he leaves a lengthy, impassioned message for Linda Powell. After a handful of takes, we have it; it's finished. I walk Campbell up the steps. I still have a little wetness in my eyes from the scene. It's one of those awkward moments. We're probably supposed to hug, do something emotional, but we've burned each other out. We nod respectfully and quickly head off in opposite directions.

1-20-92: Sadly, I agree to leave the French Club scene out for one more screening.

1-23-92: "This is a good theater," whispers Art Linson. "Even Bonfire of the Vanities previewed well here." My heart sinks. This second marketing preview takes place in Marina del Rey. (Can we ever show this movie outside of Los Angeles?) I feel like I'm in court. I sit at the back, right behind WB president and COO Terry Semel, who is seeing the movie for the first time. Singles plays well; the audience is alive. Then, heading into the dramatic section of the movie, two 15-year-old guys in Harley shirts get up and head for the lobby. Executive heads turn. They're not seeing two 15-year-olds leave; they're seeing a nation of 15-year-olds leave. I look down. I'm dying. I turn to Nancy. "I'm dying," I say. She reminds me that it was worse when we previewed Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

"What did I say then?" I ask her.

"'I'm dead.'"

In front of me, Terry Semel twirls a piece of popcorn and brings it slooooowly to his lips. This more complex version of Singles holds the audience's attention, but there is only tepid applause at the end. Standing, waiting for the Numbers, the mood is dark and brutal. The Numbers arrive. The scores go up modestly. "We're not reaching the Young Males," says one executive gravely. (I heard this on Say Anything.) "But you got yourself a star," says another. "Campbell Scott."

1-24-92: WB has offered new title suggestions: In the Midnight Hour, Love in Seattle, Leave Me a Message and a grim selection of others. It's all done politely, of course, but the pressure is unmistakable. Now, with the success of Nirvana, they've come up with yet another titlee: Come as You Are. I am powerless to stop them.

2-7-92: There is confusion about how to sell a realistic movie about love in a Lethal Weapon world. I tell the marketing executives that Singles is a movie for college-age audiences. They don't believe me. Their research says the movie appeals to Young Girls. We have lost our April release date. Singles is adrift.

I have to put all this out of my mind. We have looping to do with Campbell Scott. Our past scrimmages still hang in the air. He asks about this journal. I tell him if it ever gets published, it shouldn't be a fluff piece. "Write about us fighting and everything," he says.

2-10-92: My stealthlike attempt to return the French club scene to the movie is thwarted by Richard Chew.

2-13-92: L.A. is in the midst of an intense thunderstorm. Our third preview goes well nonetheless. The Numbers inch upward. (Tonight, the rating goes up with Young Males and down with Young Females. A new corporate panic sets in.) I'm happy, although I feel that there is still something missing at the end.

I read the Cards for an answer. I get the creepy feeling that the same 400 people are shaping this movie . . . and every movie. To read their comments, they seem drunk with the power . . . or maybe just drunk. "More wicked tit," says a fourteen-year-old, who also adds that he's married. A nineteen-year-old who checked the boxes "Male" and "Female" ("I'm bi") as well as "Black" and "White" ("Nabisco Oreo") writes in large, looping letters: "I love the sexual activity and the hooters. I love the Anal Fury. The music was awesome, bra." This one goes on my refrigerator. It's hard to read this stuff. It's like hearing people talk behind your back. I've got to remember the goal . . . a personal movie about relationships, a collage of lives and emotions. "It's honest," says another girl. I want to kiss her. I've got to sleep a little, wipe the stress off my face. What is Anal Fury?

2-16-92: Sleep comes in small bursts, as I dream of an intricate movie version of Hawaii Five-O. Even my dreams are trying to be more commercial . . . . The studio is not impressed with the Numbers. They are full of suggestions on how to make the movie more palatable. I have made the right movie for the wrong studio.

This is the biggest crime of test marketing. It hits directors at their most vulnerable time. You start out proud and alone, defending your vision. By the end, you're wobbling on two rubbery legs, obsessed on how to reach Young Males. It's a trap. Suddenly, all poetry is replaced by equation. All you want is to survive, to get those Numbers up. To get your movie released.

4-1-92: The last marketing preview will help determine our release. The screening goes well. The Numbers change only slightly – but supposedly in important ways. "We've got the Young Girls back," declares one executive, but it's clear they've written off their highest expectations. They have pigeonholed the movie as appealing to Young Girls, and that's that. A flash of perspective hits me during the screening. The movie needs to be set in context. Privately, I vow to restore the original ending, a voice montage of people all over the city, everywhere, obsessing about love. Singles is not just about six characters; it's about a world of people needing to make that connection. That's the last piece in the puzzle.

4-9-92: Still no release date. A year after filming, the world has caught up with the bands and the music we built this movie around. Pearl Jam and Soundgarden and Alice in Chains have all exploded. Epic, the label releasing our soundtrack, moves to put the music out now. WB agrees, and they quietly default into the only real title of this movie, Singles. The hometown music that helped inspire the script is now our best ally in getting the movie released.

4-13-92: New York City. Campbell and Kyra have come in for the last of many looping sessions. On their faces is the same look I'm seeing from almost everybody . . . . Let go. "Is the French Club scene still in the movie?" Campbell asks. Agonized, I can hardly tell him no. We wish each other the best. There is plenty that could be said; maybe we'll say it another time.

5-15-92: Today, we will screen the movie one last time for ourselves. It's the first time we will view the new ending, with the myriad of voices (provided by friends and nearby assistants). We've been mixing it for days, crafting the level of each voice. If it doesn't work, we don't have the time or money to fix it. Watching the complete movie for what must be the sixty-third time, my foot bounces wildly in anticipation of the new ending. It arrives. The voices build, all over the city, until it's one glorious din. Finally the movie makes its case for love. Finally we have an ending – and just in time.

5-22-92: We're in New York for three screenings, the first time the completed movie has been shown outside of Los Angeles. It is the first time we'll show it to a (mostly) college-age crowd. There is loud, heartfelt applause. Hearing it now, in New York City, is a real high. Jokingly, I later tell Richard Chew that I want to put back the French Club scene. "No," he says. A good-humored man, I have rendered him humorless on this subject. I will say this about the French Club scene, and then I will let it go. There's always laser disc.

5-23-92: When will filmmakers fight back against the damning effect of market research? Why is Singles still adrift? We continue to fight the currents. First, the Numbers . . . then the Cards . . . then the Release Schedule. Maybe this is Anal Fury.

6-2-92: "Congratulations," says the smooth voice on the telephone. "You have a release date."

I'm packing my desk to move out of our office. We've been in postproduction for over a year. There are stray artifacts from the filming – Steve and Linda's pregnancy test, Cliff's guitar picks and then a strange-looking white hatbox. I reach inside.

It's Campbell's wig. I pick it up. Except I don't see a wig, I see the making of this movie. I see every expectation, dashed hope, every exciting and exhausting aspect of filmmaking. How fragile the whole process is. The movie is finished, and I'm proud of it. Soon it will have a life of its own. I pack the wig in the back of my car. Like any great obsession, Singles dies hard.

Tonight, I'll sleep.

veryday life for Sissy Spacek began to take on a unique quality three years ago. Passing cars would screech to a halt. Teenagers at the local Jack-in-the-Box would panic. Children clutched their parents and screamed: "It's Carrie!"

So disturbingly effective was the actress' portrayal of Carrie White, the high-school outcast with secret telekinetic powers in Brian De Palma's drive-in epic Carrie, that Sissy won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress and received an Academy Award nomination for same, followed by a barrage of cover stories trumpeting her incredible promise in two other films released the next year — Welcome to L.A. and 3 Women.

Then, with the enigmatic timing of one of her characters, Sissy Spacek disappeared from the screen. In January, that will change.

First arrives Heart Beat, in which Sissy portrays Carolyn Cassady, the wife of Neal Cassady (Nick Nolte) in a love triangle with beat novelist Jack Kerouac (John Heard). Then, in March, she will appear in Coal Miner's Daughter, based on the life of Loretta Lynn from ages thirteen through thirty-five. It is Gary Busey as Buddy Holly one better; Spacek acting and singing in the biography of the queen of country music.

Loretta Lynn and Carolyn Cassady are two roles far removed from the unstable cast of characters she portrayed up through 3 Women. And that is the point. Originally assigned in 1977, this was meant to be a story of Sissy Spacek's followup to her first wave of success. "I'm holding out for a good part, or else I'll become a mountain climber," she vowed then. It seemed a flippant statement from such an insatiable acting talent. But Spacek's incredibly malleable personality could run, in the course of several minutes, from innocent tomboy to savvy young businesswoman. In the next two and a half years, her story would turn into one of Sissy Spacek holding out.

Mary Elizabeth Spacek (the nickname Sissy came from her two older brothers, Robbie and Ed Jr.) is remembered by childhood friends as a born ham. A Christmas Day arrival in 1950, hers was never a cold or neglectful childhood, and she flourished under all the attention. By age nine, she and Robbie had formed a Charleston and banjo duo that was popular around their hometown of Quitman, Texas. By her early teens, Sissy had saved enough baby-sitting money for an expensive twelve-string guitar; for years she carried it around with her like a trophy.

Life in Quitman was dominated by small events like getting caught jumping fences ("Mrs. Spacek, did you know your daughter has been riding our cows again?"), or being called Space-chick in school, or the time her football-player boyfriend asked for his ring back but Sissy made him cut if off.

"Things like that," she told me almost seriously, "made me what I am today. I felt really cradled by Quitman. I felt like my whole life was headed in a single direction. Everything was always going to happen in a certain way. I was going to go to the University of Texas at Austin, like my brother Robbie, get involved with music and maybe be a female Buddy Holly. Then I intended to come back to Quitman. Two hundred miles away was worldly enough for me.

"Then something happened to blow the air out of everything."

Robbie came down with acute leukemia. Unable to attend classes, he returned home from the university and got steadily sicker.

Right about the same time, Sissy was chosen runner-up in the area's biggest annual beauty and talent show — the Dogwood Fiesta pageant. Wearing a space dress of her own design and performing two original songs, Sissy so impressed one judge, a newspaperwoman from Longview, that she convinced Sissy the place to start her career was New York City. Seventeen-year-old Sissy asked her parents if she could spend a few days in Manhattan with cousin Rip Torn and his wife, Geraldine Page. They said they'd sleep on it.

"We let her go," Ed Spacek told me, "because she would be staying with Rip and Geraldine, and because she needed to get out from under the weight of Robbie's sickness. A lot of parents make the mistake of cutting off their children's drive. They say don't a lot. Sissy's always had that drive. When we slapped Sissy, she'd slap back. Robbie made a point of telling her not to change, and I don't think she ever did."

She stayed two months. Young Sissy Spacek in Manhattan for the summer of '67 must have been a sight to see. Adopting the Twiggy look of the times, Sissy and her guitar were inseparable.

"Geraldine was in a play at the time, and I'd go every day. I was friends with the hairdresser. Later he committed suicide; he was a male prostitute. So pure. I remember just being exposed to all kinds of amazing people. I was never frightened. I didn't know who anybody was anyway. I could talk to 'em. I was a blank page."

There is a story about the time Rip and Geraldine took the blank page to meet Terry Southern, who was working on the screenplay for Candy at the time. "I took my guitar out," Sissy recalled, "and was singing this song I had written. One of the lines was, 'I feel his soft touch while I'm sleeping.' Well, I meant kind of, you know, dreaming or something. It was a nonsexual lyric. To me.

"Terry Southern stopped me right in the middle of the song and asked me if I was a virgin. I was just . . . aghast. You didn't talk about politics, religion or money where I was brought up. And I was sure you didn't talk about sex. I was dumbfounded. And I assured him that I was. He asked, 'How could you have written a song like that?'

"Geraldine appeared to be asleep — she had performed that night — but she rose up from the couch and said, 'Terry, you don't have to stomp grapes to know what wine tastes like.'"

Sissy returned to Quitman after school had already started. "Everything had changed," she said. "I'd missed majorette practice — I didn't get to be head majorette. You know, you always build up to your senior year; it's supposed to be a big deal. Well, it just wasn't a big deal."

Her brother died early the next year. "It changed everything. What you were supposed to do was not as important as the things you felt you should do."

Her room at the University of Texas had already been secured, as was her position with a rush sorority and a full schedule of classes. It cost her $200 to forfeit those plans, but Spacek returned to New York the next summer with a new plan.

"I intended to be a rock star," she recalled. "That was my hanging-around-Greenwich-Village, following-Bob-Dylan period." An appointment with the William Morris Agency, set up by Rip Torn, resulted in agents politely asking her to come back in a few years. A demo made with Eddie Simon, Paul's brother, also fizzled. She flunked a Tonight Show audition because of "hoarseness." Bob LeMond, the manager who later came to represent John Travolta, advised her to "drop the accent and go home." (Years later, she costarred with Travolta in Carrie. "Now every time I see LeMond, he says, 'That's the little lady I told to go back to Texas.'") It was not a productive period, but she never failed to leave behind a trail of friends. Though it would have been enough to send Pollyanna packing, Sissy stayed and continued to make friends.

"I remember meeting the Allman Brothers," she explained. My best girlfriend's boyfriend was a booking agent. I was at her house, helping her make dinner. Her boyfriend was coming home with some guys. He finally came home with this whole group of guys. There was Duane, who was just about the nicest person I'd met, and his little brother Gregg, who I was kinda sweet on. Gregg had been to the dentist and had his tooth pulled. I didn't know they were a band or anything. We just hit it off; we were both from the South, and he had this big fat jaw. Then they had to leave. I went home.

"I had a date to go to the Fillmore East, and I was just sitting there, looking at the piano player and the lead guitar player and I said, 'They look just like the guys I spent the day with.' Then I went backstage, I couldn't believe it was them. I always thought rock stars would be crazy, but they were nice little Southern kids. Whenever Duane came to town after that, he'd call up to borrow my twelve-string. He never forgot a name."

Spacek eventually recorded a single for Roulette Records under the name of Rainbo. It was a folk song she wrote entitled "John, You've Gone Too Far This Time," and in it Sissy scolded John Lennon for posing nude with Yoko on the cover of Two Virgins. Conveniently, she says, she never kept a copy.

Then, finally, came acting. Enrolling in the Lee Strasberg Theatrical Institute, she set about learning the ropes of the Method. Eight months of classes taught her the fundamentals she still uses: "Anything you can use to understand the character and his motivations . . . and to become the character, you should use. I'm not above even poking my eye to help me cry. But the best method for me is to become a blank page. I'll just wear light-colored clothes, fast, go hiking, do research, and one day I'll be the character."

Intuitively curious about most everybody she meets, Spacek claims that her most enriching character study came, not at Lee Strasberg's studio, but afterward, on the way home. "My girlfriend and I," she recalled, "would walk to Fourteenth, cut across Seventeenth and Park, then go up to Max's Kansas City. It was always crowded, always full of the greatest characters I had ever seen. I felt like a beatnik; it was wonderful."

Spacek moved through the collection of underground media celebrities with ease. "I was anonymous. All my life, you see, I've been able to be in all these outrageous situations and I've been neutral. It's probably been my greatest asset."

She was befriended by Holly Woodlawn, the actress-model, and in 1970 wound up with a role as an extra in Andy Warhol's Trash. (Years afterward she would thank Warhol for that opportunity when he came to tape her for the cover of Interview after the release of 3 Women. "You were in that movie?" he asked. "Wow.")

The following year, Spacek got her first real role, as an innocent victim of white slavery in Prime Cut. Filmed in Canada with stars Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman, Spacek remembered: "I was the only one in the cast who believed the script. White slavery? You bet. I believed Lee Marvin would have picked me."

A crew member recalled that, on the set of Prime Cut, Spacek was "so goddamn sunny she made you want to put on sunglasses." I asked Spacek how she felt about her cheery image of her work.

"It never bothered me," she answered. "I am the way I am. I don't try to exploit my accent or the way I am. I'm just . . . compulsive about making other people feel comfortable. I believe, ultimately, that it's a better working situation if people are happy."

New York City began to lose its charm for Spacek just when Prime Cut gave her the visibility to continue working. She flew out to Los Angeles to read for Electra Glide in Blue (she did not get the job) and stayed. "I knew two people in L.A. and I called them both from my hotel room. One came over and said, 'Glad to have you here' and left. The other, a girlfriend from Prime Cut, came and got me and we moved in together. She'd found a great house in Beechwood Canyon and we pooled our money — we were living in the lap of luxury."

Another turning point came when Sissy was sent out to a job interview with writer-director Terrence Malick. In describing the meeting, she recalled the most minute details about Malick's rented Spanish house, even the kefir drinks that Malick's wife served. "From the moment we met, it was . . . neat. We talked about Terry's script and I was just fascinated. For hours. I forgot my girlfriend was waiting for me out in the car."

It was the beginning of Badlands and the role that many, including Sissy, still believe was her finest. An exacting writer who had worked years honing his script, Malick drew the story from the Charles Starkweather killing spree of the late Fifties. Starkweather executed his small-town girlfriend's father so the two could take off on what became an interstate crime spree. The girlfriend was jailed, while Starkweather was executed. Badlands is the story of Kit (Martin Sheen), an excitable boy who collects garbage ("It's just a job, I'm not in love with the stuff," he tells Sissy in one of the first scenes), falls for the baton-twirling neighborhood girl Holly (Spacek), kills her father (Warren Oates), and as fugitives, they achieve their dream to be together out of town. Only they find there isn't much to talk about. In the film's best scene, Sheen, about to be captured, tells the authorities that his girlfriend is blameless and shouts to her as he runs away: "Grand Coulee Dam, New Year's Day, 1963. Meet me there."

There were no major stars, but few who saw Badlands could dispute that it was among the finest films in an otherwise bleak 1973. Unfortunately, because of distributing problems, mostly only critics had the opportunity to see the film. But those critics were very vocal about the luminous performance of Badlands' star — twenty-two-year-old Sissy Spacek.

"Terry Malick gave me respect," she said, "and that reinforced everything for me. He allowed me to grow an enormous amount. His words . . . they feel so good to say." She runs her tongue over her teeth, like in a toothpaste ad. "Every frame is a painting with Terry. We all worked so long on the characters that when we finally saw the film it was like, 'Oh gosh, Kit and Holly will never exist again.' Now, whenever any of us get together, we go right into Badlands dialogue. It can be totally bewildering to outsiders."

It was also on the set of Badlands that Sissy and set designer Jack Fisk first met. They were drawn to each other, according to Fisk, "because we had the same kind of conviction to work." Fisk had heard about Malick's project through a friend who was the production manager, and he became so enthralled that he proceeded to research the period before he had even met Malick. When the two finally did get together, they hit it off and Fisk was hired.

Two years later, Fisk and Spacek were married. Fisk is a highly respected and well-paid artist in his own right and they can afford each other's selectivity. Ever since Badlands, they have often worked together on projects to form a kind of flying wedge. In a business where many failures are blamed on the speculative nature of collaborative art, Spacek and Fisk work with a tightknit set of cameramen and crew friends.

"You could wait another lifetime for a role as good as yours in Badlands," Shirley Jones once told Spacek. And for several years, it looked like that might be the case. After 1973, Sissy took few of the less-than-abundant roles offered her. Most notable was the TV movie Katherine, writer-director Jeremy Paul Kagan's story of a blue-blooded college girl turned radical. Filmed in eighteen days, it matched her with a then-obscure Henry Winkler, who played a Weatherman. "I took a few jobs in television," said Spacek. "Stuff that you forget about until someone calls up and says, 'Hi, I'm watching you on The Rookies and I don't believe what you just said.'"

Finally, in 1976 came the part of Linda Murray, the maid in Alan Rudolph's Welcome to L.A. To prepare for the role of a rock star's housecleaner, Spacek donned her blank-page look and spent time seeking out maids around town. Her part was modeled mostly after two women she met who cleaned houses in their bikinis, and with them in mind she turned in a characterization that entranced Rudolph's mentor, Robert Altman. The film, however, sat on the shelf for more than a year while its finances were sorted out.

In the meantime, Fisk took a job as art director of Brian De Palma's next film, Carrie. "Brian called one day and told me to get the book and read it," recalled Sissy. "So I went out and got it and I was just horrified. But I knew what kind of sense of humor he had and I was anxious to do it."

Spacek read for several of the parts, but De Palma had her in mind to play Chris, the bad girl (played by Nancy Allen, De Palma's wife). She had made plans to return to New York for a Vanquish commercial when De Palma called again, mostly out of courtesy.

"He told me that if I wanted to, I could try out for the part of Carrie White, but that I shouldn't miss my commercial. There was another girl that he was set on and unless he was really surprised, she was the one." In recounting this tale, Spacek assumed a look of gritty determination. "I hung up and decided to go for it."

For her screen test a couple of days later, Spacek dug out a navy blue sailor's dress she hadn't worn since grade school. She slicked her hair with Vaseline. She filled her head with thoughts of the girl who had been ridiculed at her high school. ("She was beautiful," Sissy explained, "but she was poor and didn't have money for clothes. So she wore antiques, and the kids were really brutal with her. I remember always loving her clothes, baggy and old-fashioned like they were. She was barefoot most of the time, but there was no hip, groovy scene then." Spacek looked down at her own bare feet. "And in the end, it's the outsiders who become the ones you emulate.")

Sissy sat in the studio parking lot after her screen test while Jack looked at the film with the company brass. Fisk then came running out and jumped in the car, shouting, "You got it!" "We sped off," recounted Sissy, "before anybody could change his mind."

("The other girl played Carrie as someone you could hate," Fisk said. "You could understand why everyone made fun of her. You didn't really care about her much yourself. Sissy, you felt hope for. You could almost fall in love with Carrie White when she played her, and it made the film twice as effective. De Palma said there was no contest." Fisk added, "She's so strong when she's getting into a role.")

I have always tried to present characters who are human and vulnerable; somehow they've all turned out macabre and vulnerable," said Sissy Spacek, settling herself on the porch table of her immaculate Topanga Canyon home. It was our first conversation, back in 1977, and more than a year since she'd made Carrie. She shrugged, choosing her Pollyanna outlook. "I'm at a really neat stage now, though. I can choose. If I'm careful about not losing momentum, I can be selective. Most actors have a very passive role in things. I intend now to just wait for the right part."

Throughout our interview Spacek had been warm and hospitable to the point of near suspicion. But after a while she confided: "You know, I've really been doing a lot of talking about myself. I went out on this tour for 3 Women and, you know, you can't help but see things that you really believe in turn into . . . interview fodder. Then these stories come out, and they're all kind of the same."

Seeing as how I was there for a quick interview with which to jump shamelessly on the bandwagon, I suggested an alternative: an interview centered on her next character. The one, she'd said, that would be a true departure.

"Neat" she responded conspiratorially. "Instead of doin' a regular interview, we'll just go horseback riding and talk. In another week I'll be able to talk all about the next movie. I play a wonderful woman named Melaina, who meets her lover in Vienna. It's the best role I've had since Holly in Badlands."

On the way home from a charming but interviewless afternoon, I began to wonder just how sincere it all really had been.

The phone rings. "Hi," says an unmistakable accent. "Let's go horseback riding."

In an afternoon of scaling the hills around Topanga with Spacek and Fisk, discussing mostly Sissy's childhood and family in Quitman, the subject of her next role did not come up.

Upon returning home, Fisk immediately collapsed on the sofa. Leaving her immaculate house lit only by the hazy shadows of a skylight, Sissy sat cross-legged in front of the fireplace.

"What happened to Melaina?"

She seemed crushed. "It fell through. The financing fell through. It's difficult to just let go of a character. Especially after you've been preparing and researching for weeks . . ." She sighed heavily. "I feel like, why should I just go out and find another movie. That's the question, isn't it?"

Or perhaps more accurately, just what did Hollywood have to offer one of its most valuable actresses as a followup to Carrie?

"Well," said Sissy, "the answer is — a lot of sequels to Carrie!" She laughs. "Sometimes the ego is bigger than greed.

"See those?" she asked. "See that stack of scripts? Those are all parts for weird teenage girls. Murderous teenage girls. Nymphet, telekinetic girls. All the parts that Jody Foster turned down. I seem to get them all. They don't realize I'm not a teenager. I'm twenty-six and it's getting harder to feel like a teenager."

She pounded a small fist into the wooden floor. "I feel like maybe it's time to play a woman. You know? A normal, attractive, even sexy woman."

In the next year of watching Sissy cultivate, then never play, three other roles, for one detail or another, I would come to appreciate that moment more than any other. Words sometimes seem a commitment she's reluctant to make. A somber moment of self-reflection often got interrupted by something more visually exciting: "Did you see those ducks coming across the lake? There was a mama . . . and four little babies . . . it was . . . ." She would try to pluck another word out of the air, but invariably settled for her favorite adjective — neat. It sometimes seemed that one could best gauge her moods by the verve with which Sissy Spacek said "neat."

Several weeks later, another interview attempt:

"What was it like working with Robert Altman on 3 Women?"

"It was neat," said Spacek. "We all stayed in this motel in Palm Springs. I took a lot of pictures." She runs into a back room to get the stack of photos.

"Now these," she said, "are the real 'three women.'" She produced a grainy photo, taken off a television set, of three matronly gospel singers in full throes of song. "I took this one Sunday morning."

She set the shot against an ashtray.

"Here's Bob." A shot of the imperial presence himself, Altman, seated in his hotel room. "His room was down the hall." She placed the photo about a foot away, against a bowl.

"Here I am." Sissy, sitting on her bed, captured in the mirror above the television set. She places it in front of the three women.

"Here's Shelley."

Sissy made only a few appearances after 3 Women, all on television. Sissy had casually dropped a baited line in a People magazine profile that she had been taking tap-dancing lessons in anticipation of doing a Forties musical. Sure enough, an offer came for exactly that: a project for public television called Verna: USO Girl. The story was about a spirited but acutely untalented dancer-singer sent to wartime Germany; she dies in the final scene. It was a meaty part by TV standards, but frustrating, too.

"Everything I did," Spacek explained, "the director would say 'Great.' I was not used to working that way. I only learn from the people I work with. Ultimately, you have to work for your own enlightenment — for smarts — or it gets boring. I don't like to do something just to prove I can do it."

There were elaborate kudos for her performance in Verna; they fell on polite but deaf ears. In the words of Jack Fisk: "She thought her career was over when she saw it."

Spacek did not win the Academy Award for Carrie in 1977 (Faye Dunaway won, for Network). On the phone the day after, though, she was full of enthusiasm. "On the one hand, it's a big deal. You see it every year on television. Suddenly you're there. You just have to remember what it is. It isn't a communist plot. It's an honor. People know that it's not the last word."

In the spring of 1978, sissy invited Annie Leibovitz and me to meet her in Quitman, where she was taking a short vacation.

We arrived in the pleasant town of Quitman in time for a spectacular sunset, the kind that locals watch like others would television. (Life in East Texas, it seems, is four-fifths sky.) Five miles out of town, we joined Sissy at her cabin on the edge of Lake Quitman. Her father, a retired county agricultural agent, was doing odd jobs around the yard.

"We went to Mineola to see Carrie," Ed Spacek told me later. "She was excellent in the film, and we thought De Palma used some good gimmicks. The hand scene was excellent."

A rugged man in his sixties, with the incongruously gentle face of a Gene Kelly, Ed Spacek and I were out in the middle of Lake Quitman on a fishing boat. No bites.

"We've been worrying a bit about Sissy lately." he offered. "She's passed on so many projects, you know. Rip is an actor who has mouths to feed, like many of them. He admires Sissy for being able to hold out. But he worries for her, too. We don't want to see her lose what she's built up to."

Over dinner that night at a local catfish house, the Spaceks proved an extraordinarily close family. The conversation ranged from the neighbors who served dinner in a Colonel Sanders box to which studio would be a good place for Sissy to work again. When she left the table, I casually asked if her parents might set aside a few hours to talk about their daughter. Ed Spacek instantly turned solemn.

"We're not new to show business," he said. "Rip is a relative; we know some of the traps you can fall into. And we just don't want to get in Sissy's spotlight. It's a decision we made long ago."

After dinner, when her parents had returned to their home in central Quitman, I took a walk out to the pier with Sissy.

"You have the best relationship with your parents that I've ever seen."

"It certainly has changed over the years," Sissy remarked, pulling a huge red and black Pendleton jacket around herself. "They've been real champs. When I first left Quitman they were unsure. But I always came back to visit. Everytime I'd come back I would be something different. Black eyes. Short, short skirts. They'd always say, 'Welcome home, Sissy honey. You sure you aren't a little cold in that?'"

At a small artist's opening in Santa Monica in 1978, a man with a deep tan approached Sissy: "I remember you," he said. "You brought cookies — and good vibes. My lady just said to me the other day, 'Remember that party we had out at the house in Zuma Beach in '71? That was Carrie who brought the cookies.'" He opened his mouth to laugh, but no sound came out. "Vin Parker."

Sissy Spacek smiled cheerfully. "Nice to see you again."

"Now who's that actor you're living with?"

"Well," said the actress in her East Texas twang, "you're probably thinking of my husband. Jack Fisk. The set designer. He's right over there."

"No, no," said Vin Parker (not his real name). "Didn't you live with Paul Simon?"

"No," said Spacek." You're thinking of Shelley Duvall."

Vin Parker nodded thoughtfully." Talented little guy, Paul Simon. We're doing a film with him." He finally let go of her hand. "So what's your next picture?"

"It's still up in the air," Spacek responded. It was a question with which she was more than familiar.

"Well," Vin saluted before moving on, "hope you find some work. You're a real talent."

In 1976 Doubleday issued Loretta Lynn: Coal Miner's Daughter. It was an excellent, offbeat autobiography (cowritten with George Vecsey) of a genuine American folk hero. The queen of country music is still the wife of the farm worker she married when she was thirteen. The book's success surprised even the publishers. To date it has sold over 1.5 million copies. The film rights were purchased by Universal. Some time after that, an agent showed Loretta Lynn a book of photos and asked her who she thought could play her in her life story. Lynn flicked through the photos and came upon a picture that struck her as perfect.

"Sissy Spacek," said Loretta Lynn. And from that moment onward, the issue was as good as settled. Lynn began nightly announcements from her concert stage that Sissy Spacek would be starring in the movie of Coal Miner's Daughter.

Spacek herself first heard of the casting when relatives read it in a gossip column. "I always thought country music was corny," said Spacek. "All those things you think, I thought. I went out and got the book and found that I really admired her as a woman. But I still wasn't sure there was a movie there." And yet there was Loretta, crisscrossing the country with plans to the contrary. Sissy Spacek was sure of one thing — it was time to meet the queen of country music.

The day before Annie Leibovitz and I were to leave Quitman, we piled in a car with Sissy's mother and took off on a two-hour drive to Shreveport, Louisiana, where Loretta Lynn was performing with Conway Twitty.

Lynn's bus sat outside the backstage door, a proud monument to her nearly constant road schedule. Forget about the albums that still seem to come out every few months. Forget about Lynn's much-publicized nervous exhaustion breakdowns. Forget that she still writes many of her own songs. Loretta works every market, even signing several hours' worth of autographs for those who wait in line after a show. She does this because the most important thing in her life is "a-singin' for y'all."

Loretta's surprise visitor was ushered onto the bus. Lynn emerged from the back bedroom wearing a brilliant red dress, saying, "Bam. Bam. Bam. All I hear are them dad-gum drums a-beatin' in my ear."

Then she saw Sissy, diminutive and wearing wire-rimmed glasses that allow her to look her age. Loretta gave Sissy a warm hug.

"We're exactly the same height," Sissy laughed. "Five feet two and a half." They promptly began chatting like old bridge partners, about the drive, Loretta's twenty-seven goats, and about the movie. "You're pretty," Loretta said.

Lynn's son and occasional backup singer, Ernest Ray. came bounding onto the bus. "Hey, Mom."

He stopped and looked at Sissy, who had just taken off her glasses. "Sissy?" he said rapturously.

She nodded, wide-eyed.

"Well you just stop gumming her," Loretta shooshed. "He thinks he's Jesus. You get out of here, Ernest Ray." She playfully chased him out of the bus before she retired for a few minutes into her back room for makeup.

By the end of the evening's concert, it was not hard to see that what began as pure curiosity had grown to near obsession. Sissy was chatting with all of Lynn's entourage, promising to see them again soon. Sissy turned to me, transported. "There is an incredible story to be told here."

All the way home to Quitman, Sissy practiced the inflections until they were flawless."Bam. Bam. Bam,"she said." All I hear are them dad-gum drums a-beatin' in my ear."

During a breakdown in negotiations over Coal Miner's Daughter, Spacek had met with writer-director John Byrum. Byrum had told her over dinner about his newest script, a film about the relationships between Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and Carolyn Cassady, the square Bennington student who married Neal and became companion to both ("We didn't do anything wrong; we just did it first"). For Spacek, it sounded instantly like the stretch she had been waiting for — an elegant woman who ages from twenty-two to forty-three, and in her words, "I get to play a woman and they play children.

"I fought tooth and nail to get that part," she said in our last conversation, over lunch in an L.A. restaurant. She had decided she was going to do Heart Beat, and, in the way that had become second nature to her when she made such decisions, Spacek had stormed ahead with hundreds of hours of research.

But her hold on the role had slipped several times. "Orion Pictures felt she wasn't enough to make the picture lucrative," explained John Byrum. "Diane Keaton had expressed her strong interest in doing the part, and they said, 'If you get Keaton, we'll give you all the financing you need.' You have to remember, this happened the week she won the fuckin' Oscar. She was the hottest actress in the business. It looked pretty bleak for Sissy."

Byrum himself had become convinced that Sissy was right for the part only after prodding from the film's producer, Ed Pressman. "The thing that really did it was that she was talking like a shitkicker, just being that kind of Texas bizarro. And all of a sudden, she asked, 'Do you think I can play this part?' She said it so vulnerably. I was thinking to myself, 'No way.' But I said, 'I don't know, I kind of see it like Grace Kelly. Can you act like Grace Kelly?'

"She said, 'Just a second,' and when she turned around, she looked totally different. She did this Grace Kelly impersonation, this velvety Philadelphia debutante: she was just a different fucking person. I couldn't believe it. That's when I knew I had to have her. And when she was through, she just turned into Sissy again." Byrum shook his head and laughed. "Then I realized, man, there ain't no Sissy. She's just a great movie actress."

But with Keaton's interest in the part still weighing heavily with the studio, the time came to inform Sissy. Pressman and Byrum met Fisk and Spacek for dinner. "We had to kind of let her down easy," said Byrum. "I knew she was already into the part, but the decision hadn't been made about Diane Keaton yet."

"I just freaked out", Spacek told me. "Because at that point I'd done about 4000 pages of research. Then it turned out that maybe I wasn't going to do the film. I was drinking this glass of wine and . . . I couldn't control myself. Outwardly, everything seemed fine. But I broke this wine glass in my hand. Broke it."

Several weeks later, she won the role over Keaton and was beginning filming in San Francisco. Pressman walked up and presented her with a piece of the shattered glass: "That is when you cinched it."

"In the end," Byrum explained, "she's just so amazing that I stuck by her. I refused to give Diane Keaton acting approval we just wouldn't meet her terms. Sissy had a lot to overcome with this role. One, she hadn't done a movie in two years. Two, being jerked around for weeks on this Diane Keaton thing certainly couldn't have helped her self-confidence. Third, it was the first time she was playing an adult. The fact that she overcame all these and did a remarkable job proves that we made the right decision."

Much will be written about the rather cavalier relationship between some scenes and the real facts of Kerouac's life. "I did the research and it's all true," Byrum told me last month. "I'd like to think that it's possible to go beyond the usual film biography. It's literature. Maybe it is an inaccurate representation, but it should be judged totally. It's mythology with recent characters. I really wish I'd changed their names because of this backlash. Nobody judges Citizen Kane because Marion Davies wasn't a singer, she was an actress."

For me, Heart Beat is an ensemble presentation and one in which Spacek is as powerful for the room she leaves her costars as for what she herself says.

"I don't look at myself as a professional," she told me that last time we talked. "I learned from each new set of people I worked with, It was a trying experience, keeping the balance from slipping when the characters are that close. But then, I was also working with a bunch of animals: Nolte, Heard, Byrum. I really love them, but they drove me to drink." ("Part of the reason we were all needling her was because that's what Jack and Neal did," Byrum said.)

As she laughed, I realized that her accent and attitude — even the way she walked in — had changed subtly. The lingering effect, I guessed, of Carolyn Cassady. I remembered something her brother Ed once said:

"Sissy has always been the same determined person, but she's always searching for interesting variations. She was in New York once and it started raining, so she went under this awning to get out of the rain and looked next to her. There was another girl standing there with a short skirt and big Twiggy eyes. The next day Sissy had become that girl.

"You know, we all used to sit around in Quitman waiting for her to come home. Wondering who would be standing there when we opened the door."

"I have learned a lesson," Sissy said. "At that point in my career, I had to wait for the right part. And when you spend two years not working, you forget what it's all about. Or if you don't, you think you do. And it's such a frightening thing, because so much is riding on one performance. But overall, the hardest part isn't the acting. It's telling people 'nothing' when they ask you what you're doing."

"Doesn't all the doubt seem silly to you now?"

"There was never any real doubt," responded Sissy. She thought for a moment, then leaned over. "You aren't going to have me saying 'neat' all through the article, are you?"

everal days before beginning these interviews, I overheard two teenagers looking for a good party album in a record store. "How about this," said one, holding up Joni Mitchell's Miles of Aisles. "Naaaaaah," said the other. "It's got good songs on it, but it's kind of like jazz." They bought a Cheap Trick album.

When I told this story to Joni Mitchell later, I could see the disappointment flicker across her face for an instant. Then she laughed and took a long drag from her cigarette. "Here's the thing," she said forcefully. "You have two options. You can stay the same and protect the formula that gave you your initial success. They're going to crucify you for staying the same. If you change, they're going to crucify you for changing. But staying the same is boring. And change is interesting. So of the two options," she concluded cheerfully, "I'd rather be crucified for changing."

Joni Mitchell, 36, has been living in exile from a mainstream audience for the last three years. Her last resoundingly successful album of new material was Court and Spark, a landmark in poetic songwriting, performing and in the growth of an artist we had all watched mature. From folk ballads, through Woodstock-era anthems to jazz-inflected experimentation, Joni Mitchell had influenced a generation of musicians.

Then, in 1975, she released The Hissing of Summer Lawns, her ambitious followup to 'Court and Spark.' She introduced jazz overtones, veered away from confessional songwriting and received a nearly unanimous critical drubbing. Mitchell reacted to the criticism by keeping an even lower personal profile. She spent most of her time traveling (the road album, Hejira, was released in 1976), associating with progressive jazz artists and asking questions. With Don Juan's Reckless Daughter, a double album released in the winter of 1977, she and pop music had nearly parted ways. In a time when the record-buying public was rewarding craftsmen, Mitchell seemed to be steadfastly carrying the torch for art. Her sales suffered, but this direction was leading to a historic juncture in her career.

Word first reached her in early 1978 that Charles Mingus was trying to get in touch with her. The legendary bassist-bandleader had been battling Lou Gehrig's disease out of the public eye. She contacted him and they began a long distance friendship. Mingus had noticed her ambitions and wondered if she would assist him by condensing T.S. Eliot's 'Four Quartets,' recite it and play guitar behind it for a composition he had been working on. She read the book and called him back. "I'd rather condense the Bible," she told him, and Mingus said he could dig it. They didn't speak for a time. Then, another phone call.

Mingus had written what would later become his last six melodies ("Joni I – VI," he called them), and he wanted Mitchell to write and sing the lyrics for them. She spent the last year and a half working on the project, her first collaboration, working mostly in her apartment in New York's Regency Hotel.

When Mingus died on January 5th this year, Mitchell continued writing and recording and finally finished in late spring. Including tape recordings of Mingus' voice as segues between tracks, she eventually chose to simply title the album 'Mingus.'

About marketing an all-jazz Joni Mitchell album, Elektra/Asylum Chairman of the Board Joe Smith says this: "She has taken a chunk out of her career and accomplished something truly monumental. When we received this album, I got on a conference call and talked with all our promotion men. If any radio station calls itself a trend setter, it must recognize this album and Charles Mingus. I'm also having a contest for my promotion men," he laughed, "first prize is they get to keep their jobs."

Had Smith, in the course of running the company, ever discussed commercial direction with Mitchell?

"You don't tell Joni Mitchell what to do," he said.

It was Joni Mitchell's idea to do this, her first in-depth interview in over ten years. She entered the office of her manager, Elliot Roberts, one afternoon and sat down on a sofa. She wore no makeup, a tan blouse and slacks.

"Let's turn the tape on," she said, addressing my recorder. "I'm ready to go."

An enthusiastic conversationalist, Joni Mitchell speaks quickly and purposefully, structuring her thoughts like a writer's third draft. The sessions continued at various locations over the next three days.

"If I'm censoring for anyone," she warned, "it's for my parents. They are very old-fashioned and moral people. They still don't understand me that well. I keep saying, 'Mama, Amy Vanderbilt killed herself. That should have been a tip-off that we're into a new era . . . . "

Would you like to shatter any preconceptions?
I do have this reputation for being a serious person. I'm a very analytical person, a somewhat introspective person; that's the nature of the work I do. But this is only one side of the coin, you know. I love to dance. I'm a rowdy. I'm a good-timer. Mind you, I haven't seen too many good parties since I left my hometown. People go to parties here mostly to conduct business.

There's a private club in Hollywood that usually is very empty, but on one crowded evening, I stumbled in there to this all-star cast. Linda Ronstadt was running through the parking lot being pursued by photographers, Jerry Brown was upstairs, Bob Dylan was full of his new Christian enthusiasm – "Hey Jerry, you ever thought of running this state with Christian government?" Lauren Hutton was there, Rod Stewart . . . . There were a lot of people and this little postage stamp of a dance floor, and nobody was dancing on it. These are all people who dance, in one way or another, in their acts.

So the renowned introvert comes in, and I just wanted to dance. I didn't want to dance alone, so I asked a couple of people to dance with me and nobody would. They were all incredibly shy. So I went to the bathroom, and a girl came in and hollered to me from the sink over the wall, "Is that you? I'll dance with you." I said, "Great." It was just like the Fifties, when none of the guys would dance. And it was at this moment that the girl confided to me, "You know, they all think of you as this very sad person." That was the first time that it occurred to me that even among my peer group I had developed this reputation. I figured, these guys have been reading my press or something. [Laughs] But as far as shattering preconceptions, forget it. I feel that the art is there for people to bring to it whatever they choose.

I wonder if you feel like you've beaten the odds at this point? Even the biggest pop performers usually become the victims of a fickle audience.
It's typical in this society that is so conscious of being number one and winning; the most you can really get out of it is a four-year run, just the same as in the political arena. The first year, there's the courtship prior to the election – prior to, say, the first platinum album. Then suddenly you become the king or queen of rock & roll. You have, possibly, one favorable year of office, and then they start to tear you down. So if your goals end at a platinum album or being king or queen of your idiom, when you inevitably come down from that office, you're going to be heartbroken. Miserable. Nobody likes to have less than what he had before.

My goals have been to constantly remain interested in the music. I see myself as a musical student. That's why this project with Charles [Mingus] was such a great opportunity. Here was a chance to learn, from a legitimately great artist, about a brand new idiom that I had only been flirting with before.

How did you decide to make this commitment?
Every year, when I've completed a project, I ask myself, "What am I going to do now?" In the process of asking myself that question, a lot of possibilities come up. I heard on the street that Charles was trying to contact me. He tried through normal channels and never made it. People thought it was too far-out to be true. They had all sorts of reasons for thinking it was an impossible or ridiculous combination. To me, it was fascinating. I was honored. I was curious.

Mingus was a man who generally was difficult to get close to. When did you know that you had really made the connection with him?
Oh, immediately. Immediately I felt this kind of sweet giddiness when I met him. Like I was in for some fun. He teased me a lot. He called me hillbilly; it was charming. We went through some of the old songs. "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" was the one we decided on immediately. So there was this search for another one, and he played me a lot of material. Charles put on this one record, and just before he played it, he said, "Now this song has five melodies going all at once." I said, "Yeah, I bet you want me to write five different sets of words for each of the melodies, right?" And he grinned and said, "Right." He put on the record, and it was the fastest, smokingest thing you ever heard, with all these melodies going on together.

Did you find yourself cast in the role of easing Mingus from his fear of dying?
No, that was up to him. You can't do too much to assuage someone of their fears. I wasn't in that personal a role that I was his comforter. It was a professional partnership with a lot of affection. But one day I called him up and I said, "How are you, Charles?" I never really asked him too much about his illness, but that day I did. And he said, "Oh, I'm dying. I thought I knew how to do it, but now I'm not sure." At that point I had three songs finished, and I thought, "Oh boy, I want him to be in the studio when I start to cut them. I want his approval on this. I want, him to like my direction."

This was a unique position. I've never worked for somebody else before. Although in the treatment of the music, it was much more my version of jazz. As far as the music was finally recorded. He's more traditional in a way – antielectronics and anti-avantgarde. I'm looking to make modern American music. So I just hoped that he would like what I was doing. I was taking it someplace where I would be true to myself. It was never meant as a commemorative album while we were making it. I never really believed completely that he was going to die. His spirit was so strong.

Did he hear all the songs before his death?
He heard everything but "God Must Be a Boogie Man," which he would have liked, since it is his point of view about himself. It's based on the first four pages of his book [Beneath the Underdog].

How did you go about writing lyrics to "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"? This is a classic piece of music that has . . . 
. . . Been around. That was a very difficult one. I had to find my own phrasing for the notes. The real difficulty for me was that the only thing I can believe is what has happened to me firsthand, what I see and feel with my own eyes. I had a block for three months. It's hard for me to take someone else's story and tell only his story in a song.

Charlie assailed me with historical information about Lester Young [in whose memory "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" was written] and his family background, concerning his early playing days. He used to tap dance in his family band with his father and mother. He was married to a white woman, traveling through the South in a time when that was just taboo. A lot of the great black musicians were forced into cellars or the chitlin circuit. So I had all these details, but I still couldn't, with any conscience, simply write a historical song.

Then something very magical happened. One night Don Alias and I – he plays congas on the album, and he and I have been very close for the period of the last two years – were on the subway, and we got off, I don't know why, two stops early. We came up into this cloud of steam coming out of a New York manhole. Two blocks ahead of us, under these orangeish New York lights, we see a crowd gathered. So we head toward the crowd. When we get up on it, it's a group of black men surrounding two small black boys. It's about midnight, and the two boys are dancing this very robotlike mime dance. One of the guys in the crowd slaps his leg and says, "Isn't that something, I thought tap dancing was gone forever." Immediately I'm thinking about Lester Young. They were dancing under one of those cloth awnings that goes out to the curb of a bar. I look up – and the name of the bar is the Pork Pie Hat. The music they were dancing to was jazz coming off of the jukebox inside. There were big blown-up pictures of Lester Young all around the place. It was wild.

So that became the last verse of the song. In my mind, that filled in a piece of the puzzle. I had the past and the present, and the two boys represented the future, the next generation. To me, the song then had a life of its own.

Looking back, how well did you prepare for your own success?
I never thought that far ahead. I never expected to have this degree of success.

Never? Not even practicing in front of your mirror?
No. It was a hobby that mushroomed. I was grateful to make one record. All I knew was, whatever it was that I felt was the weak link in the previous project gave me my inspiration for the next one. I wrote poetry and I painted all my life. I always wanted to play music and dabbled with it, but I never thought of putting them all together. It never occurred to me. It wasn't until Dylan began to write poetic songs that it occurred to me you could actually sing those poems.

Is that when you started to sing?
I guess I really started singing when I had polio. Neil [Young] and I both got polio in the same Canadian epidemic. I was nine, and they put me in a polio ward over Christmas. They said I might not walk again, and that I would not be able to go home for Christmas. I wouldn't go for it. So I started to sing Christmas carols and I used to sing them real loud. When the nurse came into the room I would sing louder. The boy in the bed next to me, you know, used to complain. And I discovered I was a ham. That was the first time I started to sing for people.

Do you remember the first record you bought?
The first record I bought was a piece of classical music. I saw a movie called The Story of Three Loves, and the theme was [she hums the entire melody] by Rachmaninoff, I think. Everytime it used to come on the radio it would drive me crazy. It was a 78. I mean, I had Alice in Wonderland and Tubby the Tuba, but the first one that I loved and had to buy? "The Story of Three Loves."

How about pop music?
You see, pop music was something else in that time. We're talking about the Fifties now. When I was thirteen, The Hit Parade was one hour a day – four o'clock to five o'clock. On the weekends they'd do the Top Twenty. But the rest of the radio was Mantovani, country & western, a lot of radio journalism. Mostly country & western, which I wasn't crazy about. To me it was simplistic. Even as a child I liked more complex melody.

In my teens I loved to dance. That was my thing. I instigated a Wednesday night dance 'cause I could hardly make it to the weekends. For dancing, I loved Chuck Berry. Ray Charles. "What I'd Say." I liked Elvis Presley. I liked the Everly Brothers. But then this thing happened. Rock & roll went through a really dumb vanilla period. And during that period, folk music came in to fill the hole. At that point I had friends who'd have parties and sit around and sing Kingston Trio songs. That's when I started to sing again. That's why I bought an instrument. To sing at those parties. It was no more ambitious than that. I was planning all the time to go to art school.

[Informed of the time, Mitchell realizes with a familiar shudder that she is already an hour late for a hairdresser's appointment. There are several more errands to be run before an evening photo session with Norman Seeff, and Mitchell invites the interview to continue along with her.

After a short drive down Sunset Boulevard, we arrive at the shop, situated directly across from a gigantic Bee Gees billboard. She is greeted warmly by the attendants, who find her exactly "on schedule," as usual. We resume the interview with Mitchell under the hair dryer, cloaked in a plastic coverall that coincidentally bears a repeating pattern of two be-bopping couples and the phrase, The Jazz Age.]

What kind of student were you?
I was a bad student. I finally flunked out in the twelfth grade. I went back later and picked up the subjects that I lost. I do have my high-school diploma – I figured I needed that much, just in case. College was not too interesting to me. The way I saw the educational system from an early age was that it taught you what to think, not how to think. There was no liberty, really, for free thinking. You were being trained to fit into a society where free thinking was a nuisance. I liked some of my teachers very much, but I had no interest in their subjects. So I would appease them – I think they perceived that I was not a dummy, although my report card didn't look like it. I would line the math room with ink drawings and portraits of the mathematicians. I did a tree of life for my biology teacher. I was always staying late at the school, down on my knees painting something.

How do you think other students viewed you?
I'm not sure I have a clear picture of myself. My identity, since it wasn't through the grade system, was that I was a good dancer and an artist. And also, I was very well dressed. I made a lot of my own clothes. I worked in ladies' wear and I modeled. I had access to sample clothes that were too fashionable for our community, and I could buy them cheaply. I would go hang out on the streets dressed to the T, even in hat and gloves. I hung out downtown with the Ukrainians and the Indians; they were more emotionally honest and they were better dancers.

When I went back to my own neighborhood, I found that I had a provocative image. They thought I was loose because I always liked rowdies. I thought the way the kids danced at my school was kind of, you know, funny. I remember a recurring statement on my report card – "Joan does not relate well." I know that I was aloof. Perhaps some people thought that I was a snob.

There came a split when I rejected sororities and that whole thing. I didn't go for that. But there also came a stage when my friends who were juvenile delinquents suddenly became criminals. They could go into very dull jobs or they could go into crime. Crime is very romantic in your youth. I suddenly thought, "Here's where the romance ends. I don't see myself in jail . . . . "

So you went to art school, and at the end of your first year decided to go to Toronto to become a folk singer.
I was only a folk singer for about two years, and that was several years before I ever made a record. By that time, it wasn't really folk music anymore. It was some new American phenomenon. Later, they called it singer/songwriters. Or art songs, which I liked best. Some people get nervous about that word. Art. They think it's a pretentious word from the giddyap. To me, words are only symbols, and the word art has never lost its vitality. It still has meaning to me. Love lost its meaning to me. God lost its meaning to me. But art never lost its meaning. I always knew what I meant by art. Now I've got all three of them back [laughs].

Did your folk-singing period include the time you spent in Detroit working with Chuck Mitchell?
Yes. We never really were a full-fledged duo. I'm a bad learner, see. I bypass the educational system. I learn by a process more like osmosis. It's by inspiration and desire. So when we would try to work up songs together, we would bang into differences of opinion. Some people say, "Oh, Joan, that's just because you're lazy." But in a way, more than laziness, it's a kind of block that runs all through my rebellious personality. If someone tries to teach me a part that I don't find particularly interesting, it won't stick. I'll end up doing what I wanted to do in the first place, and then they're annoyed.

We had a difference of opinion in material. It was more like two people onstage at the same time, sometimes singing together. We had a difficult time.

When your marriage broke up, you moved to New York City, and artists like Tom Rush began covering your songs. You became totally self-sufficient – booking your own tours and handling all your financial affairs. Was that your nature, or was it a reaction to the end of the marriage?
Both. At that point, I didn't know how far it was going to carry me. I had a little circuit of clubs that I could go in and say, "Okay, your capacity is such and such. I've got you up to full capacity now. Last time I made this much; this time, why don't you pay me this much more, and you can still make a profit. Let's be fair." People were starting to record my songs; I drew [audiences] even though I didn't have a record out. I really felt self-sufficient. I was working constantly, every night, and I was trying to build up a bank account because I didn't think it was going to last too long. I thought I was going to have to go back into what I knew, which was women's wear. Become a buyer for a department store. But I was going to go on with it as long as I could. Or maybe go into commercial art. Whatever.

So you were less sure then that the songs would keep coming?
In some ways I had more confidence. I was outspoken. I enjoyed performing. I loved the compliments I received when I came offstage. Everything seemed to be proportionate to me. I had $400 in the bank. I thought I was filthy rich. I liked the liberty of it all. I liked the idea that I was going to North Carolina, visiting all these mysterious states. I used to tell long, rambling tales onstage. It was very casual.

I remember the first time I played the Newport Folk Festival. It was the first glimmering of what was to come. We went to a party – it was held at a fraternity house and it was guarded. Only people who were supposed to be there were there. I was with a road manager at that point, a girlfriend who was helping me out. They said, "You can't come in." My girlfriend said, "Do you know who this is?" She said my name and these people standing by the door let out this gasp. My eyes bugged out of my head. I had the strangest reaction: I turned on my heel and I ran for ten blocks in the other direction. It pumped me so full of adrenalin, I bolted like a deer. I came back to Janie and said, "I'm so embarrassed, man, why did I do that? It's a mystery to me." Well, she had lived with . . . [laughs] retarded children, right. And a retard is smart in a lot of ways. They're simplified down to a kind of intelligence that a more complex mind is not hip to. Janie said, "I think that's one of the sanest things I have ever seen, you know."

Then it began to get really disproportionate. I couldn't really enjoy it after that. I know it was good, but the adoration seemed out of line. The next thing was going through the primary adjustments, where more people are attracted to you because you smell of success. And they're simultaneously saying to you, "Don't change." But as soon as you have so many hangers-on, you have to change, and then you go through the pains of hearing that you "Changed, man." It goes to your head. There's a whole lot of levels of adjustment. There are no books written on it; nobody tells you what to expect. Some people get all puffed up and say, "I deserved it." I thought it was too much to live up to. I thought, "You don't even know who I am. You want to worship me?"

That's why I became a confessional poet. I thought, "You better know who you're applauding up here." It was a compulsion to be honest with my audience.

You and Neil Young have always been close. How did you first meet?
I was married to Chuck Mitchell at the time. We came to Winnipeg, playing this Fourth Dimension [folk] circuit. We were there over Christmas. I remember putting up this Christmas tree in our hotel room. Neil, you know, was this rock & roller who was coming around to folk music through Bob Dylan. Of course. Anyway, Neil came out to the club, and we liked him immediately. He was the same way he is now – this offhanded, dry wit. And you know what his ambition was at the time? He wanted a hearse, and a chicken farm. And when you think of it, what he's done with his dream is not that far off. He just added a few buffalo. And a fleet of antique cars. He's always been pretty true to his vision.

But none of us had any grandiose ideas about the kind of success that we received. In those days it was really a long shot. Especially for a Canadian. I remember my mother talking to a neighbor who asked, "Where is Joan living?" And she said, "In New York; she's a musician." And they went, "Ohhh, you poor woman." It was hard for them to relate.

Later, you know, Neil abandoned his rock & roll band and came out to Toronto. I didn't know him very well at the time we were there. I was just leaving for Detroit. We didn't connect then. It was years later, when I got to California – Elliot [Roberts] and I came out as strangers in a strange land – and we went to a Buffalo Springfield session to see Neil. He was the only other person I knew. That's where I met everybody else. And the scene started to come together.

By this time, David Crosby had "discovered" you singing in a club in Coconut Grove, Florida. What was he like back then?
He was tanned. He was straight. He was clearing out his boat, and it was going to be the beginning of a new life for him. He was paranoid about his hair, I remember. Having long hair in a short hair society. He had a wonderful sense of humor. Crosby has enthusiasm like no one else. He can make you feel like a million bucks. Or he can bring you down with the same force. Crosby, in producing that first album, did me an incredible service, which I will never forget. He used his success and name to make sure my songs weren't tampered with to suit the folk-rock trend.

I had just come back from London. That was during the Twiggy-Viva era, and I remember I wore a lot of makeup. I think I even had on false eyelashes at the time. And Crosby was from his scrub-faced California culture, so one of his first projects in our relationship was to encourage me to let go of all of this elaborate war paint [laughs]. It was a great liberation, to get up in the morning and wash your face . . . and not have to do anything else.

Is there a moment you can look back on when you realized that you were no longer a child, that you had grown up?
There's a moment I can think of – although I'm still a child. Sometimes I feel seven years old. I'll be standing in the kitchen and all of a sudden my body wants to jump around. For no reason at all. You've seen kids that suddenly just get a burst of energy? That part of my child is still alive. I don't repress those urges, except in certain company.

My artwork, at the time I made the first album, was still very concerned with childhood. It was full of the remnants of fairy tales and fantasia. My songs still make references to fairy tales. They referred to kings and queens. Mind you, that was also part of the times, and I pay colonial allegiance to Queen Lizzy. But suddenly I realized that I was preoccupied with the things of my girlhood and I was twenty-four years old. I remember being at the Philadelphia Folk Festival and having this sensation. It was like falling to earth. It was about the time of my second album. It felt almost as if I'd had my head in the clouds long enough. And then there was a plummeting into the earth, tinged with a little bit of apprehension and fear. Shortly after that, everything began to change. There were fewer adjectives to my poetry. Fewer curlicues to my drawing. Everything began to get more bold. And solid in a way.

By the time of my fourth album [Blue, 1971], I came to another turning point – that terrible opportunity that people are given in their lives. The day that they discover to the tips of their toes that they're assholes [solemn moment, then a gale of laughter]. And you have to work on from there. And decide what your values are. Which parts of you are no longer really necessary. They belong to childhood's end. Blue really was a turning point in a lot of ways. As Court and Spark was a turning point later on. In the state that I was at in my inquiry about life and direction and relationships, I perceived a lot of hate in my heart. You know, "I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some, I love you when I forget about me" ["All I Want"]. I perceived my inability to love at that point. And it horrified me. It's something still that I . . . I hate to say I'm working on, because the idea of work implies effort, and effort implies you'll never get there. But it's something I'm noticing.

Having laid so much of your life out for public ears, do you now look back on some things and wince?
The things that I look back on and sort of shrug off, maybe in a weak moment grimace over [smiles], are the parts when I see myself imitating something else. Affectations as opposed to style. It's very hard to be true to yourself. For instance, I don't care too much for the second album I made [Clouds]. I like the first one, the first one's honest. Blue is an honest album. Clouds has some honest moments on it, but at the time, I was singing a lot with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, and they had a style, out of necessity, to blend with one another. They had a way of affecting vowel sounds so that when they sang together, they would sing like a unit. I picked up on that and there's a lot of that on the album. I find it now kind of irritating to listen to, in the same way that I find a lot of black affectations irritating. White singers sounding like they come from deep Georgia, you know? It always seems ridiculous to me. It always seemed to me that a great singer – now we're talking about excellence, not popularity – but a great singer would sing closer to his or her own speaking voice.

I think Billie Holiday was a very natural singer. In the context of opera, Maria Callas was an excellent singer. I think the lead singer from the Doobie Brothers [Mike McDonald] is a very natural singer.

["I think Bob Dylan had the right idea when he wore the same leather jacket for ten years," Mitchell says on the way back to her Bel Air home to pick up several changes of clothes. "Georgia O'Keeffe has got it down to a uniform she wears every day."

She buzzes open her gate, whips her Mercedes sedan into the garage and disappears into an upstairs bedroom. Her home is spacious, filled with plants and with her own paintings. The Mingus oil works – done at the Regency during her worst periods of writer's block – lie stacked in the hallway just outside the kitchen.

A few minutes later, Mitchell comes bustling into the living room with a small wardrobe, and it's back down Sunset Boulevard to Norman Seeff's studio. It's her fourth session in as many years with the photographer, and they work well together. Both coach each other. Mitchell lectures him on how "you try celebrities here, you push them to the limit, test them against your zen training." Seeff shouts at her to be quiet and "transcend yourself." Every now and then Seeff puts down the camera and they have a brief cross-fire philosophical discussion. They continue working all night.

The interview continued the next afternoon by Mitchell's pool. We sat in a small nook under the scorching sun, and for several hours, she talked with unflagging energy.]

Ten years ago, you had begun to represent the Woodstock ethic. Someone could say, "There is a Joni Mitchell type," and you would know exactly what he meant. Was that a concern of yours?
Very much so. I remember showing up at a Carole King concert in Central Park in a pair of Yves St. Laurent pants. And a good shirt. They were simple clothes, but they were of a good quality. And I felt . . . really uncomfortable. I felt there were certain things that I liked, that were a part of me, that were outside the hippie guard. Things that were a part of me from before this delicious period in the Sixties when we were fresh and were thinking fresh things . . . . It was a good time period. It was a healthy idea that we were working toward, but there came a time when it had become a ritual, a flat-out style.

I began to make this transition, under a lot of peer pressure. I remember seeing, even when I went to The Last Waltz, "Miss Mitchell showed up looking like a Beverly Hills housewife." I was outside the uniform of rock & roll and it was annoying to some people. And as a reply to this prejudice, I wrote that song, "The Boho Dance": "Nothing is capsulized in me/In either side of town." As a demand for liberty.

There was a time when you and Laura Nyro were considered to be the two purveyors of female singer/songwriting. Now it's all but taken for granted that Laura Nyro wasn't "tough enough" to survive in the business. Do you think that your own survival has meant a certain toughness?
Gee, I don't know if that's the case. Inspiration can run out, you know. Laura Nyro made a choice that has tempted me on many occasions. And that was to lead an ordinary life. She married a carpenter, as I understand, and turned her back on it all. Which is brave and tough in its own way. Many, many times as a writer, I've come to a day where I say, "None of this has any meaning." If you maintain that point of view, if you hold onto it and possess it, that's it for you. There's a possibility that you can come firmly to that conclusion, as Rimbaud did, and give it up. I've always managed to move out of those pockets.

At a certain point, I actually tried to move back to Canada, into the bush. My idea was to follow my advice and get back to nature. I built a house that I thought would function with or without electricity. I was going to grow gardens and everything. But I found that I was too spoiled already. I had too much choice. I could take the more difficult, old-fashioned way for a short period of time, but the idea of doing it forever would not work. I have reclusive fits, though, all the time. Not that it isn't rewarding, you know. It is. I mean, I do it for myself first, but I don't want to do it for myself only. I feel I can still share my work with people and they appreciate it. I guess it is my calling.

Around 1971, after Blue, it was reported that you had retired from the road. You returned a year and a half later with For the Roses. Was that material that you had written up in Canada?
Yes. Most of For the Roses was written there.

What did your parents think of the inside shot?
I remember my mother putting on glasses to scrutinize it more closely. Then my father said, "Myrtle, people do things like this these days." Which was a great attitude. It was the most innocent of nudes, kind of like a Botticelli pose. It was meant to express that line: "I'm looking way out at the ocean, love to see that green water in motion, there's this reef around me" ["Lesson in Survival"]. Joel Bernstein is the only photographer I would feel comfortable enough to take off my clothes for. It was part of our concept for the cover when we were going to call the album Judgment of the Moon and Stars. We were originally going to set that photograph in a circle and replace the daylight sky with the starry starry night, so it would be like a Magritte. At that time, no one was paying homage to Magritte. Then Elliot said, "Joan, how would you like to see $5.98 plastered across your ass?" [Laughs] So it became the inside.

How aware were you that your songs were being scrutinized for the relationships they could be about? Even Rolling Stone drew a diagram of your supposed brokenhearted lovers and also called you Old Lady of the Year.
I never saw it. The people that were involved in it called up to console me. My victims called first [laughs]. That took some of the sting out of it. It was ludicrous. I mean, even when they were drawing all these brokenhearted lines out of my life and my ability to love well, I wasn't so unique. There was a lot of affection in those relationships. The fact that I couldn't stay in them for one reason or another was painful to me. The men involved are good people. I'm fond of them to this day. We have a mutual affection, even though we've gone on to new relationships. Certainly there are pockets of hurt that come. You come a little battered out of a relationship that doesn't go on forever. I don't live in bitterness.

I'm a confronter by nature. I have a tendency to confront my relationships much more often than people would care. I'm always being told that I talk too much. It's not that I like to, but I habitually confront before I escape. Rather than go out and try to drown my sorrows or something, I'll wallow and muddle through them. My friends thought for a long time that this was done out of some act of masochism. I began to believe it myself. But at this time in my life, I would say that it has paid some dividend. By confronting those things and thinking them through as deeply as my limited intelligence would allow, there's a certain richness that comes in time. Even psychiatrists, mind whores for the most part, don't have a healthy attitude toward depression. They get bored with it. I think their problem is they need to be deeply depressed.

My relationship with Graham [Nash] is a great, enduring one. We lived together for some time – we were married, you might say. The time Graham and I were together was a highly productive period for me as an artist. I painted a great deal, and the bulk of my best drawings were done in '69 and '70 when we were together. To contend with this hypercreative woman, Graham tried his hand at several things. Painting. Stained glass. And finally he came to the camera. I feel he's not just a good photographer, he's a great one. His work is so lyrical. Some of his pictures are worth a thousand words. Even after we broke up, Graham made a gift of a very fine camera and a book of Cartier-Bresson photographs. I became an avid photographer myself. He gave the gift back to me. Even though the romance ended, the creative aspect of our relationship has continued to branch out.

This is the thing that Rolling Stone, when it made a diagram of broken hearts, was being very simplistic about. It was an easy target to slam me for my romantic alliances. That's human nature. That hurt, but not nearly so much as when they began to tear apart The Hissing of Summer Lawns. Ignorantly. I couldn't get together, in any way; it being human nature to take the attacks that were given certain projects. I got very frustrated at the turning point, when the press began to turn against me.

When did you first meet Bob Dylan?
The first official meeting was the Johnny Cash Show in 1969. We played that together. Afterward Johnny had a party at his house. So we met briefly there.

Over the years there were a series of brief encounters. Tests. Little art games. I always had an affection for him. At one point we were at a concert – whose concert was that? [Shrugs] How soon we forget. Anyway, we're backstage at this concert. Bobby and [Dylan's friend] Louie Kemp were holding up the wall. I went over there and opened up the conversation with painting. I knew he was discovering painting. At that point I had an idea for a canvas that I wanted to do. I'd just come from New Mexico, and the color of the land there was still very much with me. I'd seen color combinations that had never occurred to me before. Lavender and wheat, like old-fashioned licorice, you know, when you bite into it and there's this peculiar, rich green and brown color? The soil was like that, and the foliage coming out of it was vivid in the context of this color of earth. Anyway, I was describing something like that, really getting carried away with all of the colors. And Bobby says to me [an inspired imitation]: "When you paint, do you use white?" And I said, "Of course." He said, "'Cause if you don't use white, your paint gets muddy." I thought, "Aha, the boy's been taking art lessons."

The next time we had a brief conversation was when Paul McCartney had a party on the Queen Mary, and everybody left the table and Bobby and I were sitting there. After a long silence he said, "If you were gonna paint this room, what would you paint?" I said, "Well, let me think. I'd paint the mirrored ball spinning, I'd paint the women in the washroom, the band . . . . " Later all the stuff came back to me as part of a dream that became the song "Paprika Plains." I said, "What would you paint?" He said, "I'd paint this coffee cup." Later, he wrote "One More Cup of Coffee."

Is it true that you once played Dylan a just-finished tape of Court and Spark and he fell asleep?
This is true.

What does this do to your confidence when Bob Dylan falls asleep in the middle of your album?
Let me see, there was Louie Kemp and a girlfriend of his and David Geffen [then president of Elektra/Asylum Records] and Dylan. There was all this fussing over Bobby's project, 'cause he was new to the label, and Court and Spark, which was a big breakthrough for me, was being entirely and almost rudely dismissed. Geffen's excuse was, since I was living in a room in his house at the time, that he had heard it through all of its stages, and it was no longer any surprise to him. Dylan played his album [Planet Waves], and everybody went, "Oh wow." I played mine, and everybody talked and Bobby fell asleep. [Laughs] I said, "Wait a minute, you guys, this is some different kind of music for me, check it out." I knew it was good. I think Bobby was just being cute [laughs].

Prior to Court and Spark, your albums were mostly kept to sparse interpretations. Had you always heard arrangements like that in your head?
Not really. I had attempted to play my music with rock & roll players, but they couldn't grasp the subtlety of the form. I've never studied music, so I'd always be talking in abstractions. And they'd laugh, "Aww, isn't that cute? She's trying to tell us how to play." Never negatively, but appeasingly, you know. And finally it was Russ Kunkel who said, "Joni, you'd better get yourself a jazz drummer."

One night I went down to the Baked Potato [an L.A. jazz club] to hear the L.A. Express play. I knew Tom Scott, I'd done some work on For the Roses with him. When I heard the band, I was very enthusiastic, and I asked them to play on my next session.

When they got in the studio, it was the same problem. They didn't really know how heavy to play, and I was used to being the whole orchestra. Many nights I would be very discouraged. But one night we suddenly overcame the obstacles. The next thing we knew, we were all aware we were making something quite unique.

A commonly asked question among your long-term fans right now is, what happened to the melodies?
The album with Charles is incredibly melodic. What it is, is more melody. Granted, "Coyote" is not a melodic tune. It's rhythmic, it's almost chantlike. A lot of it is spoken: "No regrets, Coyote." But I've always been a lover of melody. I don't think that I've ever lost that. It's just that at a certain point, my poetry began to spill out of the form and into something more relative to a jazz sense of melody, which was restating the melody in variation. If you have four verses, maybe it'll be slightly different everytime it comes around. But that's just different. It doesn't always have to be melodic. So what, you know? You take a painter, and maybe he's been painting multicolored canvases. All of a sudden he decides to paint two-tone compositions. I figure anything Picasso could do [laughs] . . . .

Don't you believe in compromise?
I don't believe so much in compromise as I don't believe in art that has become so elitist that only fourteen people in the world can appreciate it. For instance on this project, there was a possibility that people would have this prejudice – "Oh, it sounds like cocktail lounge music." Or, "That sounds like Johnny Carson show music." I wanted somehow or other to make something that transcended that prejudice. I feel that I solved that problem. It remains to be seen, but I feel that the music, while being very modern, still contains an almost folk-music simplicity. I don't think that it's intimidating. Some people get intimidated by jazz. It's like higher mathematics to them.

Was The Hissing of Summer Lawns more of an L.A. album for you than Court and Spark?
Yes, because Court and Spark still contains a lot of songs written up in Canada. The song "Court and Spark" itself was written up on my land there. It deals with a story based on Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast.

The Hissing of Summer Lawns is a suburban album. About the time that album came around I thought, "I'm not going to be your sin eater any longer." So I began to write social description as opposed to personal confession. I met with a tremendous amount of resentment. People thought suddenly that I was secure in my success, that I was being a snot and was attacking them. The basic theme of the album, which everybody thought was so abstract, was just any summer day in any neighborhood when people turn their sprinklers on all up and down the block. It's just that hiss of suburbia.

People thought it was very narcissistic of me to be swimming around in a pool, which I thought was an odd observation. It was an act of activity. As opposed to sexual posturing, which runs through the business – nobody ever pointed a finger at narcissism there. I had stopped being confessional. I think they were ready to nail me anyway. They would have said, "More morose, scathing introspection." They were ready to get me; that's the way I figure it. It was my second year in office. The cartoonists had their fun. There weren't enough good jokes left, so it was time to throw me out of office and get a new president. It's politics.

It sounds like it surprised you when it actually happened.
It really surprised me. In retrospect, it doesn't surprise me at all. I listened to that album recently, 'cause I was going to rework "Edith and the Kingpin." I was surprised. I feel that the times have caught up with it. At that time, I was beginning to introduce – for lack of a better word – jazz overtones. Nobody was really doing that. In the two years that followed, it became more acceptable, and when Steely Dan finally made Aja, with some of the same sidemen, it was applauded as a great, if somewhat eccentric, work. I fail even to see the eccentricity of it, myself. Perhaps there was a weary tone in my voice that irritated people, but there was so much of it that was accessible.

I remember having a conversation with you about a year ago. Months had gone by and you were still smarting over the criticism you'd received for your last album, Don Juan's Reckless Daughter. What exactly was your frustration?
If I experience any frustration, it's the frustration of being misunderstood. But that's what stardom is – a glamorous misunderstanding. All the way along, I know that some of these projects are eccentric. I know that there are parts that are experimental, and some of them are half-baked. I certainly have been pushing the limits and – even for myself – not all of my experiments are completely successful. But they lay the groundwork for further developments. Sooner or later, some of those experiments will come to fruition. So I have to lay out a certain amount of my growing pains in public. I like the idea that annually there is a place where I can distribute the art that I have collected for the year. That's the only thing that I feel I want to protect, really. And that means having a certain amount of commercial success.

It's a credit to the people that have supported me in spite of the bad publicity of the last four years – the out-and-out panning of a lot of fine and unusual projects – that at least they felt this work had some moments of accessible beauty. If a reviewer sits down and he plays [one of these albums] two or three times, it's just going to sound freaky to him. There are moods I'm in when I can't stand to listen to some of my own music. I don't expect it to always be appropriate. But come the right moment, where we're on the same wavelength, it might slip in on you.

I feel frustrated sometimes. I feel bitterness, but I'm not embittered. Feelings pass. A lot of the humor in the music is missed. They insist on painting me as this tragic . . . well not even a tragic, because in this town people don't understand tragedy. All they understand is drama. You have to be moral to understand tragedy [laughs].

Elliot Roberts, your manager, realized not too long ago that he had canceled more shows than you'd actually played. Was there an instance when you walked offstage after two songs?
There was one time that I was onstage for one song. And I left. I felt very bad for the audience. It was impossible for me to continue. There's that old show-business axiom that the show must go on. But if I listed for you the strikes that were against me that night, I think that you could dig it. It's not easy to leave an audience sitting there. I was still in bad health from going out on Rolling Thunder, which was mad. Heavy drama, no sleep – a circus. I'd requested before the show went on to get out of it. But it was too late. I had bronchitis. A bone in my spine was out of place and was pinching like crazy. So I was in physical pain. I was in emotional pain. I was going with someone in the band and we were in the process of splitting up. We were in a Quonset hut and the sound was ricocheting. And I just made the decision.

That can get to be costly.
The money is not the motivation anyway. I use one of two analogies all the time with Elliot. One that I was his racehorse. Or if I really wanted out of something I would say to him, "Be a good pimp, Elliot, don't put me out [laughs]."

I stopped touring for a while for a couple of reasons. One of them was that I felt it threatened my writing, that it limited my experience to that of a traveling rock & roll singer. I didn't want only to be a scribe to that particular facet of life, a minority experience. There were so many people documenting that already. That's rock & roll calling itself rock & roll simply by talking about rock & roll.

You may tour this summer with a band including Pat Metheny and Jaco Pastorious, presumably to play material from the Mingus album. What kind of set would you do?
With these players, we're talking about young musicians who have no real musical or categorical preferences. We all love rock & roll. We all love folk music. And we all love jazz. If anything, we want to be considered a musical event. We're going to do some traditional African ceremonial drum pieces. I would like to get loose enough to dance. Jaco, you know, is a bass player, but he's also a fantastic keyboard player. In this band, we're going to try to switch instruments. It should be very creative.

What were the origins of Hejira? That album seems to have a sound all its own . . . .
Well, after the end of my last tour, it was a case of waiting again. I had an idea; I knew I wanted to travel. I was sitting out at the beach at Neil's [Young] place and I was thinking, "I want to travel, I don't know where and I don't know who with." Two friends of mine came to the door and said, "We're driving across country." I said, "I've been waiting for you; I'm gone." So we drove across country, then we parted ways. It was my car, so I drove back alone. The Hejira album was written mostly while I was traveling in the car. That's why there were no piano songs, if you remember.

Hejira was an obscure word, but it said exactly what I wanted. Running away, honorably. It dealt with the leaving of a relationship, but without the sense of failure that accompanied the breakup of my previous relationships. I felt that it was not necessarily anybody's fault. It was a new attitude.

You were nowhere to be found in the Dylan film from Rolling Thunder – Renaldo and Clara.
Yes. I asked not to be in it.

Why?
I joined Rolling Thunder as a spectator. I would have been content to follow it for three cities just as an observer, but since I was there I was asked to participate. Then, for mystical reasons of my own, I made a pact with myself that I would stay on the thing until it was over. It was a trial of sorts for me. I went out in a foot soldier position. I made up songs onstage. I sang in French, badly. I did a lot of things to prevent myself from getting in the way. What was in it for me hadn't anything to do with applause or the performing aspect. It was simply to be allowed to remain an observer and a witness to an incredible spectacle. As a result, the parts of the film that I was in...for all I know, it was powerful and interesting footage. But I preferred to be invisible. [Laughs nervously] I've got my own reasons why.

Do you make it a point to check out some of the newer female songwriters – like the Wilson sisters from Heart or Rickie Lee Jones?
I'll tell you, the last three years I have been very narrow. In a way, I turned my back on pop music and rock & roll. I was concentrating mostly on jazz, modern classical music, Stravinsky, polyphonic music. During that time I developed a lack of appreciation for pop music.

Out of cynicism?
No no. It was part of an artistic process. It seemed to me, in the context of what I was exploring, there was no reason in the world you should be comparing Stravinsky to Heart. But if you're given Heart or Stravinsky, I was more interested in Stravinsky. Or In a Silent Way.

Now I don't even listen to the jazz station in my car. The jazz station is full of mediocrity, too. I listen to AM, and I like what I hear. There's only a certain amount of fine work in any idiom. The rest of it is just copyists. Regurgitation. Obvious rip-offs. Mingus has a song, "If Charlie Parker Was a Gunslinger, There'd Be a Whole Lot of Dead Copycats." Sometimes I find myself sharing this point of view. He figured you don't settle for anything else but uniqueness. The name of the game to him – and to me – is to become a full individual. I remember a time when I was very flattered if somebody told me that I was as good as Peter, Paul and Mary. Or that I sounded like Judy Collins. Then one day I discovered I didn't want to be a second-rate anything. I have to remember to be compassionate. Otherwise it really pisses me off to hear somebody getting a whole lot of public roar and, "Oh this is the newest and the greatest," when it's really the newest and greatest copy. There are bands coming now that are really good. They're interesting; they've got some vitality and some fire, but – say they're Englishmen who sound like Bob Dylan. I listen to it and it's pleasant on the radio, but as an artist I say to myself, "If you're that good, how come you can't be yourself?"

Has anyone played you Elvis Costello? Any New Wave music?
I don't know enough to talk about it. It's ignorance speaking a bit, but one of the things I like that's coming out in rock & roll now is the Archie and Betty and Veronica aspect of the characters. I like the way [Rick Nielsen] wears a high-school sweater and bow tie and beanie. [Bun E. Carlos] will have an accountant's short-sleeved shirt and short haircut and wire-rimmed glasses. I love the look of Cheap Trick.

I understand the punk movement. It reminds me of a very exciting time in my own life. It's nothing new – I was a punk in the Fifties. Devo, I think, is great. I love them. They are like Dadaists to me. Everything that they express is a complete reaction against everything that we stood for. But they do it so well, theatrically speaking. And with a great sense of humor. I love it. Now as far as putting on a Devo album? It wouldn't be something I would do. It's the visuals that make them fresh and fascinating to me.

Do you think you've achieved greatness?
[Long pause] Greatness is a point of view. There is great rock & roll. But great rock & roll within the context of music, historically, is slight. I think that I am growing as a painter. I'm growing as a musician. I'm growing as a communicator, a poet, all the time. But growth implies that if you look back, there was improvement. I don't see necessarily that this album is any, to use your word, greater than the Blue album. This has a lot more sophistication, but it's very difficult to define what greatness is. Honesty? Genius? The Blue album, there's hardly a dishonest note in the vocals. At that period of my life, I had no personal defenses. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn't pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defenses there either.

The vocals are real on this Mingus album. The interplay between the musicians is spontaneous and real. I can put my dukes up now if I have to in life, but out of appreciation for honesty. I won't settle for anything less in the studio. So much of music is politics. It's going for the big vote. It amounts to a lot of baby kissing.

Do you listen to Fleetwood Mac?
I enjoy them. To make a whole album like that, I think, would leave me wanting something more. For my own self. Not to put them down in any way. I'm still obsessed with pushing the perimeters of what entails a pop song. I can't really let go of that impulse yet. I don't know where I'm going. I never really do. My songs could come out any shape at this point. I am thinking now of keeping it simpler. Quite naturally, my experimentation has led me to a conclusion, and I feel myself returning more to basics and to my roots in folk music. But I don't even know what that simplicity might turn out like.

Do you still feel a comradeship with the Eagles, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt?
The Eagles have really stretched out thematically. Jackson writes fine songs. Linda is very special. I'm a great appreciator of all those people. But at a certain point, I don't know if it was to protect me from getting a swelled head or what, I was denied any kind of positive feedback from a lot of sources. Like I go to a party and everybody shows up. I figure everybody must have a tape of their album on 'em. I figure, "Let's sit down and play these things." Right? A lot of times it would end up where I would be the only one who would end up being that pushy.

I always had this childhood idea that artists in a scene, you know, compared and discussed and disagreed with each other. But it was all done openly, perhaps in a shadowy cafe over wine. But because of this pressure for commercial success, maybe in a way we're deprived of this interchange.

[Mitchell adjourns the day's session with a quick and soundless dive into her pool.

As I walk into her kitchen the next day to finish the interviews, she is on the phone with a friend who is inquiring about the possibility of visiting Georgia O'Keeffe, the reclusive, great American artist, at her home in New Mexico. Mitchell herself became friendly with O'Keeffe only after several tenuous meetings; once she turned around and returned to Los Angeles before even knocking on O'Keeffe's door and introducing herself. Now in her nineties, O'Keeffe has few visitors, and Mitchell was careful about providing instructions to the house.

Later I would learn the caller was Warren Beatty, who, in researching his next film, about the revolutionary John Reed, wanted to speak with people who were alive in his day.

"I don't know," Mitchell allows with great affection. "Georgia might say, 'Ah yes, it was a very . . . yellow time period.'"]

Have you moved to New York City?
I consider myself spread across this continent in a very disorganized manner. I have three residences. One is wild and natural. One is New York, which needs no description. California, to me, represents old friends, and health. I love to swim. If there's anything that I love about this place here it's the luxury of being able to swim, which is like flying to me. I could get in the pool, float around for about two hours and never touch the sides. That's better than any psychiatrist to me. I'm working out my body, working out my lungs – the poor things are blackened with cigarette smoke – and looking at nature. I don't have that in New York.

New York gives me an opportunity to flex a muscle that I don't really get to use; for instance, out there there is directness. I find that it makes me stronger. You don't have so many anonymous encounters out here. In New York, constantly, the street is challenging you to relate to it.

What do you think of the theory that great art comes from hunger and pain? You seem now to be living a very comfortable life.
Pain has very little to do with environment. You can be sitting at the most beautiful place in the world, which doesn't necessarily have to be private property, and not be able to see it for pain. So no. Misery knows no rent bracket [laughs]. At this time in my life, I've confronted a lot of my devils. A lot of them were pretty silly, but they were incredibly real at the time.

I don't feel guilty for my success or my lifestyle. I feel that sometimes having a lot of acquisitions leads to a responsibility that is more time-consuming than the art. That's probably one of the reasons why people feel the artist should remain in poverty. My most important possession is my pool – it's one luxury I don't really question.

Do you have many close women friends?
I have a few good women friends. I like them and I trust them. But generally speaking, I'm a little afraid of women. I don't know, it's a funny time for women. We demand a certain sensitivity. We've made our outward attacks at machoism, right, in favor of the new sensitive male. But we're just at the fledgling state of our liberty where we can't handle it. I think we ask men to be sensitive and equal, but deep down think it's unnatural. And we really want them to be stronger than us. So you get into this paradoxical thing.

I believe in equality. I believe that I am male and I am female. Not that I'm saying I'm bisexual – I believe in heterosexuality. I think ultimately it's the most difficult and nourishing of them all. But I do understand homosexuality in these times. It seems to be a peculiar, in many cases, necessary, alternative to this mess that's happening between the men and the women. I know a lot of women now who have come through the whole gamut and they're at the position where they almost don't want to deal with it anymore. They want to be celibate. Men are not at this place at all. The new woman is embracing this as a possibility. If there wasn't always this intense sexual competition between women, it might provide a climate for them to develop a camaraderie. In my observation, what passes for feminine camaraderie is conspiracy. I would love to make new women friends, but I hardly have time to do justice to the ones I have.

Did it change your concept of dying to spend the last year and a half with Charles Mingus?
Not completely. See, in my lifetime, I've had so many brushes with death myself, not that I'm saying that I'm not afraid to die – of course I still am. Afraid of it. 'Cause it's so final, you know. As far as a ceremony, of how I would like it to be treated, I'm not really sure. I mean it's an inevitable thing. I feel I'll live a long time. I'm confident that I'll live to be in my eighties. So I have a more immediate problem than confronting death.

Filling those years?
Aging gracefully. Which is easier in some societies than in this one. Especially in this very glamour-conscious town where women become neurotic at a certain age and go for surgery and any number of things to disguise that fact.

I had an interesting experience concerning aging in Hollywood. A friend of mine and I went into this Beverly Hills restaurant. It happened to be Fernando Lamas' birthday. So, sitting at the table next to us was this long supper of the old Hollywood. They were drinking toasts to Marilyn Monroe and there were lots of stories flying around about celebrities and people who they had known. There was a tremendous amount of glamour represented. Well-tended glamour. The fourth face-lift. Maintaining the youthful silhouette. I looked around and thought, "Is this the way that we must go in this town?" Is our hippie philosophy going to surrender to this?

I think if you're healthy, aging can be quite a beautiful process, and I think we've created an artificial problem for ourselves. Generally speaking, men are very generous. But I think that's the main problem, you know, at thirty-six, I'm examining.

You hold Georgia O'Keeffe as an ideal. Yet there she is in her nineties, living in the middle of the desert with only her art. She has no children. It seems like it could be a very lonely life . . . .
That's the part about it. I don't know, really, what your choices are. Obviously that's a constant battle with me. Is my maternity to amount to a lot of black plastic? Am I going to annually bear this litter of songs and send them out into the marketplace and have them crucified for this reason or that . . . .

Or praised.
Or praised. Let me not get lopsided about that. I certainly get my fair share of appreciation. You know, in a few years, I'll be past a safe childbearing age. I don't see many women raising children successfully alone, and as yet I haven't been able to bond with a man who I could see myself with in constant company for the twenty years that're necessary to do a good job of that. I would take that job seriously. I wouldn't just frivolously get pregnant and bring a child into this world, especially a world that has such a difficult future as the one we're facing. Also, the children of celebrities have been notoriously troubled. But when it comes to the business of raising children, I finally feel emotionally stable enough to deal with it. It's taken me this long, but it may be something that's denied me. It may be one of my little regrets in my old age. I still leave the future open, and given the right relationship, even if I thought the relationship had a potential longevity of, say, six years, I might do it.

David Crosby once said this about you, with all affection: "Joni Mitchell is about as modest as Mussolini." [She smiles, shakes head] And while it's been my observation that you have a much better sense of humor than Mussolini, it's also true that you have no apologies to offer for anything in your career.
I like to work myself up to a state of enthusiasm about anything I do, otherwise, what's the point? I see a lot of people and say, "Hey, you got an album coming out, what's it like?" They say, "Oh, it's okay." I say, "Gee, you're putting out an album and you think it's okay? Where is your enthusiasm, man?" They don't like to hear that. I'm not talking about arrogance, but I believe in real enthusiasm. That's probably where Crosby's quote comes from.

There is also a deeper point to be made. In looking back over all that we've talked about, it seems that everything about you is geared to your creative muse, and it is to that muse that you have remained true. At any expense.
I'll tell you, any acts of frustration or concern or anxiety in my life are all peripheral to a very solid core. A very strong, continuing course I've been following. All this other stuff is just the flak that you get for engaging in the analytical process in the first place. Even Freud knew that; to me it was the hippest thing he ever said: "Dissection of personality is no way to self-knowledge." All you get out of that is literature, not necessarily peace of mind. It's a satisfying, but dangerous, way to learn about yourself.

Ever find yourself the only one speaking out on certain subjects?
All the time. On many nights I go home and say, "Mitch, you know, you're gonna have to start going only to comedies now. And only reading Kurt Vonnegut. Put those Nietzsche books away."

Last question. What would you have listed, as Woody Allen did at the end of Manhattan, as your reasons why life is worth living?
It would be very similar to his. I would name different musicians, but it might finally be a beautiful face that would make me put the microphone down. I would just be thinking fondly of someone who I love, you know. And just dreaming off . . . . Basically if you want to say it in one word? Happiness?

It's a funny thing about happiness. You can strive and strive and strive to be happy, but happiness will sneak up on you in the most peculiar ways. I feel happy suddenly. I don't know why. Some days, the way the light strikes things. Or for some beautifully immature reason like finding myself running to the kitchen to make myself some toast. Happiness comes to me even on a bad day. In very, very strange ways. I'm very happy in my life right now.


It was supposed to be something holy, for God's sake, when old Ernie sat down at the piano . . . I swear to God, If I were a piano player, or an actor or something, and all those dopes thought I was terrific, I'd hate it. I wouldn't even want them to clap for me. People always clap at the wrong things. If I were a piano player, I'd play it in the goddamn closet. 
HOLDEN CAUFIELD, The Catcher in the Rye

MY PARENTS OCCUPIED the bedroom directly above mine while I was growing up. Luckily they were heavy sleepers, and loud music late at night didn't seem to bother them much – unless, of course, it was the high-pitched guitar or vocal work of Neil Young. On such occasions, my mother would trudge downstairs, rap at the door and stand there with a look that suggested the wrath of every deprived sleeper over the ages.

"Are we going to listen to this man baying at the moon all night?" she would invariably ask, on behalf of my father and herself.

There was a time, sure, when I tried to explain to them what it was to be a Neil Young fan. "How important is an in-tune vocal?" . . . "But it's great when he hits the same note thirty-eight times in 'Down By The River.' " Here was an artist, as opposed to an entertainer. Here was someone who would never turn up hawking his wares on some talk show.

Neil Young's popularity would soon speak for itself. In 1972, my parents would hear "Heart of Gold" played in the supermarket, find it tuneful, and begin to see things differently. When Neil Young announced he would be playing San Diego, our hometown, on a rare concert tour, it became a family outing. My sister, my teenage cousins visiting from Kentucky, my parents and I all went to the show.

Neil Young appeared right on time, nervously walking out in front of the screaming crowd, one arm upraised. He looked skittish and tired as he picked up a guitar and began to sing an acoustic song, one of the first he ever wrote, called "Sugar Mountain." The audience rushed the stage, shouted for the electric songs and Young called his band out onstage. But instead of Buffalo Springfield chestnuts and standards like "Down By The River," they played a set of reckless new music, causing no small tension in the arena.

Then, during the final song of the evening, the pressure seemed to cause Neil Young to crack. He began to shout, "Wake up San Diego, Get up San Diego . . ." A few minutes later, the houselights were turned on and the hall was filled with an eerie silence.

"He acts like a drunken monkey," said one of my cousins. The rest of the family didn't say much. We didn't talk about Neil Young for the next few years.

Recently, I found myself back in the same old room late one night, typing this article and listening to Neil Young records, when a familiar knock came at the door.

"Well," said my mother with a note of sentimentality. "A survivor."

THE FACT THAT NEIL YOUNG CAN barely relate to his successful current album, Comes a Time, is typical of his career, and perhaps one of the reasons he is a survivor. He's thirty-three and he's spent twelve years in the forefront of the most fickle of businesses, shattering expectations. "It's in the middle of a soft place," he says of the album. "It was made to come out a year ago and got hung up with pressing problems. I hear it on the radio and it sounds nice . . . But I'm somewhere else now. I'm into rock & roll."

Held up because Young had approved a faulty test pressing of the album, and then bought back $160,000 worth of the already printed record because of his mistake, Comes a Time is a complacent Neil Young album. In the time that it took for the LP to come out, something in music changed. Much of the music made by artists who came to popularity in the Sixties and Seventies began to fall on deaf young ears.

"I first knew something was going on when we visited England a year and a half ago," says Young. Sitting in the half-light of his ranch home in northern California after the end of his Rust Never Sleeps tour, Young speaks with an urgency. "Kids were tired of the rock stars and the limousines and the abusing of stage privileges as stars. There was new music the kids were listening to. As soon as I heard my contemporaries saying, 'God, what the fuck is this . . . This is going to be over in three months,' I knew it was a sure sign right there that they're going to bite it if they don't watch out. And a lot of them are biting it this year. People are not going to come back to see the same thing over and over again. It's got to change. It's the snake that eats itself. Punk music, New Wave. You call it what you want. It's rock & roll to me, it's still the basis of what's going on."

Neil Young had given up on touring and was working on his second movie, a comedy/fantasy/musical called Human Highway, in which he plays a folk singer named Neil Young, when his friend Dean Stockwell (who plays Otto, the manager, in the film) told him about the New Wave band, Devo. Young knew immediately that this was the band he wanted for a nightmare episode in the film. He even had the song they would play together, the new one called "Out Of The Blue" that he'd written with the Sex Pistols in mind ("It's better to burn out/Than it is to rust").

Members of Devo were flown in from their base in Akron, Ohio, to shoot the nightmare sequence in front of an audience at the San Francisco punk club Mabuhay Gardens. Devo introduced Young as "Grandpa Granola," and played the song live and in a local studio before flying back to Akron. Later, listening closely to the tape, Young heard two of the members chanting the phrase, "Rust never sleeps."

He called them in Akron. "What is 'Rust never sleeps'?"

Two of the members of Devo, it turns out, used to be in advertising. They had devised the phrase during a campaign for the rust-remover Rustoleum and decided it fit the song. To Young, it fit his very career, and his battle against the dreaded, creeping disease of trying to make a good thing last. Suddenly, Young once again felt the pull of the road, felt the pull of rock & roll. He booked a six-week tour with Crazy Horse, plotted a fully scripted show with filmmakers/directors L.A. Johnson and Jeanne Field, and took off on Rust Never Sleeps.

"I knew I had to get out there and rock," he says. "But I also knew that I couldn't see myself out there doing it the way it had always been. Standing out there with a microphone. It's got to continue to be as new as when it started.

"The music business is so big these days, I feel dwarfed by it. I mean, I put out a record and, you know, it does okay. Somebody like Foreigner or Boston, they come out with a record and sell ten times as many as I do. I think that's great. But I still feel like this . . . little guy."

A set was designed in which huge amps and a huge microphone were constructed before the audience's eyes by Young's roadies. Now they were Road-Eyes, dressed in blackface and hoods not unlike Star Wars Jawas. (When Young explained the concept to his puzzled crew, he instructed them to "wave yourself goodbye for a few hours then move with fervor and purpose." Young himself would play a child dreaming about rock & roll.) Beginning the shows with "Sugar Mountain," he moved through a cross section of old and new songs, ending with a phenomenally loud set with Crazy Horse. "I wanted people to leave saying that Neil Young's show was the loudest fucking thing they'd ever heard." It was a heavy-metal tour de force, and somewhere in the middle of the tour, Comes a Time, Young's most subdued album since Harvest, was finally released.

"You know," says Young, confidently, "I do the same thing over and over and over again. It has a slightly different look to it every time. This tour seemed to wrap something up. It's a retrospective, but it's looking back on right now. I think I broke through to another arena; now, people won't be surprised if I enhance the program with actors and diverge totally away from music, then come back out of it into music again. It's making rock & roll more visible to me."

He is struck with an idea. "I'm lucky," says Young. "Somehow, by doing what I wanted to do, I manage to give people what they don't want to hear and they still come back. I haven't been able to figure that out yet."

I FIRST MET NEIL YOUNG IN 1973, ON A bus to San Luis Obispo. He had come along to play guitar with the Eagles at a small benefit for the Indian community there. Young sat playing banjo, a grinning cipher in reflector shades. I was instructed not to talk to him, that he had nothing to say.

After the show – which climaxed with a fiery "Down By The River" that Young and the Eagles still talk about – Young plopped down in the seat next to mine. His shades were off, and his eyes were dark, sunken shadows below an Indian-like forehead. But they were mischievous, adolescent eyes. Dennis the Menace eyes.

"Hey," he said, "Bernard Shakey." We shook hands, and he began to tell me that he was an amateur filmmaker, that he was working on his first film (he was finishing Journey Through the Past at the time) and was a little nervous about it. He talked excitedly, punctuating his words with a smirk. "Tough business. I'd hate to go back to shooting Hyatt House commercials."

I turned to look out the window, remembering my impression of Neil Young as a depressed loner. Now here he was – a joker. I turned back around. He was gone, of course, and I was right back where I started.

Young must have remembered the conversation or enjoyed my gullibility. Two years later, when he was releasing his most antipop album, Tonight's the Night, I received a phone call saying that he was ready to do an interview.

There was a listening party in Los Angeles, his first-ever such media function, and we made plans over beers to meet at manager Elliot Roberts' office. I arrived the next morning to find Young, cheerfully cordial, discussing the album with three hungover disc jockeys. "I just wanted to obliterate everything that I was, you know," he was saying, "and wipe the slate clean."

After the conference, Young remained on a sofa drinking orange juice and playing with his dog, Art ("Art is just a dog on my porch"). He sized me up and smiled.

"You need some sun," he said. "You look like people expect me to look. Let's go for a ride."

We walked across Sunset Strip and Young rented a red Mercedes convertible for the occasion of his first extensive interview in five years. A sweltering afternoon, we took a ride out Pacific Coast Highway. After a few attempts at small talk, Young turned and announced: "My uncle played ukulele. Outside of that, I don't really come from a musical family."

There was a lengthy silence. A car full of surfers made a dangerous swerve through traffic to pull alongside for a look. "Hippies," he cracked.

I asked him about his childhood, a question that met with a good two minutes of silence. I began to wonder if the interview was already over. Young was born in Toronto, the son of a sportswriter for the Toronto Sun, Scott Young. Young's parents split up when he was ten, and Neil moved to nearby Winnipeg with his mother, Rassie.

"I know the newspaper business," said Young, who was a Sun paperboy. "I had a pretty good upbringing. I remember really good things about both my parents. I don't feel the need to communicate all that much with them. I think back on my childhood and I remember moving around a lot, from school to school. I was always breaking in." He looked over. "I liked to play jokes on people."

Jokes?

"Same old shit," he continued talkatively. "Once, I'd become a victim of a series of chump attacks by some of the bullies in my room. I looked up and three guys were staring at me, mouthing, 'you low-life prick.' Then the guy who sat in front of me turned around and hit my books off the desk with his elbow. He did this a few times. I guess I wore the wrong color of clothes or something. Maybe I looked too much like a mamma's boy for them.

"Anyway, I went up to the teacher and asked if I could have the dictionary. This was the first time I'd broken the ice and put my hand up to ask for anything since I got to the fucking place. Everybody thought I didn't speak. So I got the dictionary, this big Webster's with little indentations for your thumb under every letter. I took it back to my desk, thumbed through it a little bit. Then I just sort of stood up in my seat, raised it up above my head as far as I could and hit the guy in front of me over the head with it. Knocked him out.

"Yeah, I got expelled for a day and a half, but I let those people know just where I was at. That's the way I fight. If you're going to fight, you may as well fight to wipe who or whatever it is out. Or don't fight at all."

He looked over again, offering me a vision of my own amazement in his shades.

"Few years later, I just felt it," he concluded cheerfully. "All of a sudden I wanted a guitar and that was it."

IN HIS MIDTEENS, NEIL YOUNG HIT the Winnipeg dance-band circuit with his band, the Squires, and his own songs – stinging instrumentals heavily influenced by the Shadows and the Ventures. Then came the Beatles and Bob Dylan, and Young started to write lyrics.

"I never forgot," he says, "that every time a new Beatles or Dylan album came out, you knew they were way beyond it. They were always doing something else, always moving down the line."

Moving back to Toronto, Young soon took up a twelve-string acoustic guitar and tried folk singing around the coffeehouses. He made friends easily with other musicians like Stephen Stills, Joni Mitchell and Richie Furay, who were traveling along the same path. Mitchell wrote "The Circle Game" for him after hearing "Sugar Mountain," which was about growing too old to get into the local teen club.

Rock & roll, meanwhile, was booming. One of the biggest bands around Toronto was a group called Ricky James and the Mynah Birds. "We played rock and blues," James, now a disco star, recalls in Los Angeles. "I remember our first gig," continues James. "When Neil took his first solo, he was so excited he leaped off the stage, the plug came out and nobody heard anything."

The Mynah Birds broke up after a flirtation with Motown when James, AWOL from the navy, was pressed back into the service. Their young career at a standstill, James and Young spent a teary afternoon promising each other that they would form another band after James returned. "It was heavy, man," recalls James. "I had really gotten close to the cat. He was never very healthy – he got bad epileptic fits sometimes – but he had balls like you wouldn't believe."

After a few months, money ran out and Young had to sell the Mynah Birds' equipment. Typical of his sense of humor, he used the money to buy a long, black Pontiac hearse and headed for Los Angeles with Mynah Birds' bassist Bruce Palmer. Neither had working permits or the proper papers. "But it you were looking for a break," says Young, "the great Canadian Dream is to get out. So we came down anyway."

They were lumbering down Hollywood Boulevard when the Ontario license plates were spotted by two folkies Young had met up in Canada. Stephen Stills and Richie Furay pulled Young and Palmer over. There, on the street, they talked of their stalled careers. Stills and Furay's folk group had broken up, Stills had even failed an audition to join the Monkees because of his teeth. They decided to form a group, later adding Dewey Martin on drums. They named themselves after a tractor, the Buffalo Springfield.

THE BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD WERE largely a West Coast phenomenon for most of their stormy two-year existence. Around Los Angeles, where their single, "For What It's Worth," became an anthem for the budding hippies battling cops on Sunset Strip, they were a sensation – a tougher, younger brother to the Byrds. Their live shows centered around incredible lead-guitar battles between Stills, the fair-haired, bluesy Southerner, and Young, the dark and fiery "Hollywood Indian" who was always either quitting or rejoining the group. Their fans split into camps and argued for years about why the group broke up.

"Stills and I have always gotten along," explained Young on his bus during his 1976 tour, as we headed for a show in Madison, Wisconsin. "I just had too much energy and so much creative flow coming out that when I wanted to get something down, I just felt like, 'This is my fucking trip and I don't have to listen to anybody else's.' I'd do what they wanted with their stuff, but I needed more space with my own. And that was a constant problem in my head. So that was why I had to quit. Then I'd come back 'cause it sounded so good. I just wasn't mature enough to deal with it. Everything was going much too fast."

By late 1968, the intense chemistry of the group had lit a fire under all its members. Everyone had scattered in different directions, leaving bassist and then engineer Jim Messina to assemble the band's third and final album, Last Time Around, at Sunset Sound studios. While Young was recording, though, Joni Mitchell was down the hall, beginning her first solo album produced by her then-boyfriend David Crosby.

"I don't really want to go down there," said Crosby at the time. "That guy Neil Young is strange."

Mitchell turned to her manager. "Elliot," she said, "you have to meet Neil Young. You'll love his sense of humor."

The possessor of a mercurial wit, Brooklyn-born Elliot Roberts immediately hit it off with Young. "Everybody was intimidated by Neil," says Roberts. "I heard all these stories – Neil had left the band twice . . . Everyone was always on eggshells around Neil. Say the wrong word, he's gone. That is all I ever heard. Well, I found it easier to deal with Neil than Stephen. I used to tell people the funny things Neil had said. They'd say, 'Neil?' "

After the Springfield's demise, Roberts became Young's manager, and launched him on a solo career. Roberts tested Young's appeal by getting him a guest appearance during a Dave Van Ronk show at a Pasadena nightclub. "We stayed up all night because we were so thrilled he didn't get booed off," recalls Roberts. "He hated his voice and thought all his songs were depressing."

AFTER THE SPRINGFIELD," YOUNG said during that ride on his tour bus, "I wanted to get out to the sticks and think everything over." Along with his wife, Susan, Young moved into a spindly house high atop a hill in Topanga Canyon. After finishing his first solo album, Neil Young, in a local studio – which, these days, he fondly characterizes as "Overdub City" – he built his own studio in his garage.

"The problem was, I needed a band again," Young said. "I met these guys that were, to me, the American Rolling Stones. There has never been a bad night with them, to this day. Crazy Horse."

Danny Whitten was the leader of Crazy Horse. A husky, blond guitarist/surfer, the intensely sensitive Whitten wrote all his songs about the same sixteen-year-old girl who had broken his heart. He had moved to California from back East with Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot, as part of a vocal group called Danny and the Memories.

"You had the impression," Elliot Roberts recalls, "that he had been through a lot and was very soulful. Whatever very soulful is, he had it. Very strong guy, but you could see that you say the wrong word and you'd slap him in the face. We all liked Danny. He was obviously very talented and Neil was drawn to him instantly."

Young met Whitten through a mutual girlfriend while he was still with Buffalo Springfield, and they began playing together. Whitten's guitar playing cut slashing patterns across Young's. After working on the first Buffalo Springfield album during the day, Neil fell into the habit of dropping by Talbot and Whitten's house in Laurel Canyon at night. "We used to have a great time," remembers Talbot, "sitting around, singing 'Mr. Soul' in D-modal turning – all four of us singing harmony."

Young eventually enticed Whitten, Talbot and Molina to come up to his Topanga home/studio and record some "strange songs" he'd written while being laid up with the flu. "In a single day," Talbot says, "we did 'Cinnamon Girl,' 'Down By The River' and 'Cowgirl in the Sand.' There wasn't much need to discuss it . . ."

Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere – still Neil Young's favorite of all his albums – was finished in two weeks. He and his new band toured small halls as Neil Young and Crazy Horse, and together they built a lasting reputation for hard, metallic rock. Young would spin off on searing guitar solos during which he wildly tipped back and forth on his heels. Because he acted so quickly, Young was never considered as a leftover piece of the Buffalo Springfield for long.

Neither was Stephen Stills, who had meanwhile teamed with David Crosby and Graham Nash to record Crosby, Stills & Nash. When the trio finished their album and realized they needed another guitarist to hold up the instrumental end of things on the road, Stills visited Neil Young. Just beginning his career with Crazy Horse, Young knew he had a decision to make.

"I decided to do both," Young has said. "The obligation with Crosby, Stills and Nash wasn't going to be that heavy, a few songs and lead guitar." It became much, much bigger than that. Or, as Billy Talbot says, "Neil joined up with those guys, man, and everything went crazy."

Young punched the clock twice a day for a year, touring with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, then Crazy Horse, then CSNY again. "I never really fit into CSNY as well as Joe Walsh does with the Eagles," he explains. "Everybody had a different viewpoint on what's happening and it takes a whole lot to get them all together. It's a great group for that. Four totally different people who all know how it should be done, whatever it is."

Young went straight from Déjà Vu, the first CSNY album, into recording his own third solo album, inspired by actor Dean Stockwell when he unraveled a screenplay idea of his. It was about three lives – one of them a moody musician – on the day that a mythical tidal wave swallowed Topanga Canyon and was called After the Goldrush. The apocalyptic theme influenced the bulk of material for Young's album of the same name.

"The film fell through," says Young, "and there I was with a record. So I put it out. Would have made a great movie."

It was a more poetic album than Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, due in part to the fact that the tenacious, black Les Paul guitar he played throughout the previous album had been lost. "I took it to this store to be repaired," says Young. "I came back to pick it up the next week and the store was gone."

Young chose an enigmatic cover for the album, a solarized shot of him passing an old lady on his way to a CSNY show in New York City. It symbolized his own passage, his breakup with wife Susan and a farewell to the Topanga house that had already started to become overrun with fans ("I came home to find people I didn't know in my bedroom"). The album captured a huge audience for Young as a solo artist, and that success brought more changes than he could have ever planned for.

"By the time Young did After the Goldrush, he'd fired us," says Billy Talbot. "Danny was doing . . . you know."

Talbot jabs his arm.

"I was really surprised when Danny became a junkie. There was no reason. In those days, people just started shooting right up. Didn't snort nothin'. He just shot some speed, the next day some smack and from then on, he was a junkie. He was always a strong person and he was also a strong junkie. Did more than anyone else, they tell me."

For all his disheveled looks and maybe-I-know-where-I-am-maybe-I-don't stage presence, Neil Young is not a drug case. For a long time, according to friends, he would ask, "Is this hard grass," before accepting a joint. ("When I get high," he says, "I'm a basket case.)" He has never taken acid and never tried heroin. And Whitten's strong aura of junk scared Young considerably – in fact, he wrote "The Needle and the Damage Done" for him.

WITH AFTER THE GOLDRUSH just released, Neil Young embarked on a solo acoustic tour of small halls, performing the best of his old work and a slew of new songs, written about his new ranch in northern California and a new love. During a stopover in Nashville to tape The Johnny Cash Show, he began recording a follow-up to After the Goldrush. Spiriting away the show's other two guests, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor, he recorded "Old Man" and "Heart of Gold," with Taylor on banjo, at a local studio. But a lingering back ailment worsened as he continued on the tour, and after it ended, Young suffered a slipped disk on his left side. He underwent operations and a long confinement on his ranch. Doctor's orders allowed him only four hours a day on his feet.

"I tried to stay away from the success as much as possible," Young says. "And being laid up in bed gave me a lot of time to think about what had happened. I thought the popularity was good, but I also knew that something else was dying. I became really reclusive.

"There was a long time when I felt connected with the outer world 'cause I was still looking. Then you get everything the way you want it. You stop looking out so much and start looking in. And that's why in my head I felt something change; I was thinking about all these things. I was lying on my back for a long time. It affected my music. My whole spirit was prone."

The lethargic downbeat of much of Harvest, Young's next album, was partially a result of the sedation he was under during much of the recording. Released in February of 1972, it was the biggest-selling album of that year and influenced an entire genre of country rockers.

Young's back gradually improved; he began writing and playing electric guitar again, and used some of his wealth from Harvest to finance his movie, Journey Through the Past. In the fall of 1972, Young decided it was time to end the seclusion and undertake his biggest tour yet – three months long and recorded every night for a live album (Time Fades Away) of new material. Jack Nitzsche, the producer of his first solo tracks, was on piano; the Nashville rhythm-section core from Harvest – Kenny Buttrey on drums, Time Drummond on bass and Ben Keith on steel guitar; and the rumored-to-be-healthy-again Danny Whitten on lead guitar. A huge crew of technicians was brought in, and the mammoth tour began rehearsing at Young's Broken Arrow ranch.

Danny Whitten was the last to show up, still in the full throes of kicking his habit "city style" – with numbing quantities of booze and drugs. The band started rehearsing, and Whitten soon stopped and propped himself up with his guitar. "You guys are really great," he gurgled in wonderment. He looked at the sheet music Young had studiously written out for the musicians. "Hey Neil, where's my music stand?" he demanded and broke up laughing. "Hey Jack! Play 'Be My Baby.'"

Whitten was driven to the airport, given a plane ticket and fifty dollars. Arriving in L.A., he used the money to score a dose of pure heroin. Danny Whitten shot it up and died that night.

NEIL WAS PRETTY STRANGE ON HIS big tour," recalls former tour manager Leo Makota. "He'd already been through heavy changes with Danny, then Neil tells him to go and Danny reads that as him just not having it anymore . . . and kills himself. It's like playing God. And are you ready to play God? But that was just one thing that happened.

"Neil was trying to get a certain sound out of the band that he apparently could never find. The band would jam at sound checks in the afternoons and sound great. Then they'd come in and do the show at night and never make it. Neil's mood never seemed happy or comfortable. So you have a situation where everybody is trying to please him and nobody really pleased him."

One reason, conjectures Makota (who is now a carpenter), is that everyone got a little money-hungry seeing those full houses every night. The band revolted, wanting more dollars and a percentage. Makota himself tried negotiating for a bigger crew price. "I admit," says Makota, "we should have just done the job that was at hand."

The revolt took Neil by surprise. "It turned him against everything," Elliot Roberts recalls. "He didn't know how to handle his friends constantly hitting on him for more money. He rebelled against the success, started to see what it did to people. I was afraid to leave. I knew if I left, Neil was gone."

Meanwhile, puzzled audiences were treated to ragged versions of his new songs. ("Every time I go out on the road," Young says now, "the album that just came out is behind me. I don't want to lose the time frame to old material.") Young took to drinking tequila to relax. All those expectant faces waiting for "Heart of Gold" began to look, as he would later write, like an ocean of shaking hands that grab at the sky. They were his demons. And, in Cleveland, he began to scream at them. "Wake up, Cleveland. Get up . . ." The rest of the tour was biding time.

He returned to the solitude of his ranch, bewildered, saddled with problems from Journey Through the Past and deeply upset. "For the first time in my life," he says, "I couldn't get anything to turn out the way I wanted." It was the beginning of a time he would later call his Dark Period.

THERE WAS A BRIEF TRY AT A CSNY reunion in Hawaii in the summer of 1973, but Young left the proceedings because he was "too tired to start another cycle." Causing no small resentment within the group, Young returned to Los Angeles, where he found another person close to him had ODed – CSNY guitar tuner Bruce Berry. For the first time since Danny Whitten's death, Young rounded up the remainder of Crazy Horse, and they started recording at a small rehearsal room. The sessions began after midnight, after everyone had drunk enough tequila and played enough pool to do songs in memory of Whitten and Berry. According to Ralph Molina, "a picture began to develop . . . and it became Tonight's the Night."

An album in which tuneful vocals, commercial choruses and artistic humility took a back seat to raw emotion, Tonight's the Night was rejected by Warner Bros. in 1974 when Young, wearing wraparound, razorback shades, brought the tapes to the executive offices. "I always noticed that Otis Redding would fuck up words on his records, but he's just keep on going . . . if the spirit was there," Young explains today. "Not everyone, however, shares that particular philosophy."

Young then recorded a slightly more conventional work, On the Beach, but not before taking his rejected album on the road throughout Europe. He assumed the character of a sleazy Miami Beach emcee, a chatterbox of Vegas-type one-liners, and directed the band through a tequila-soaked show.

"I slipped out of myself," Young recalls, "and into something easier for me to take . . . that would destroy what everybody though I was. I don't like to be prejudged before I do something. I don't like people to say it's going to be this, and have them be right. I might have been really slapping the audience in the face with some of the shows, but they had their minds totally turned around and that's more than you can say for most concerts. It was really healthy for me. I was the same person for too long.

"We tried to put on the entire show for under fifty dollars. 'Everything is cheaper than it looks' was our motto. We hung one light bulb behind the stage. We did everything that we could to get as far out on the edge and try to play our music and to get it loose. I took the Eagles on tour with me – they thought I was pretty crazy. They were a good, clean country group back then, and they sounded like what a lot of people would have expected me to sound like after hearing Harvest. They think, "We're gonna have an evening of really fine country-flavored rock & roll and fold rock.' And then we just came out and . . . took 'em all to Miami Beach."

Returning to the States in the wake of a massive critical backlash against him, Young, in a characteristic turn-around, agreed to a huge CSNY summer tour of stadiums. He traveled separately, in a Winnebago, leaving immediately after the show to keep his participation strictly musical. At every turn, though, there were accusations that CSNY had reunited only for the money.

"There's no question that we got paid a lot of money for doing it," says Young. "But there's no question that we were all there and delivered every night. It was just that we were playing these huge fucking places where we could get people to come in like cattle and fucking see us from half a mile away and listen to you squeak. If the wind was blowing the wrong way, they couldn't even hear you do that. It's a huge money trip, which is the exact antithesis of what all those people are idealistically trying to see in their heads when they come to see us play. So that's where the problem is. It costs a lot of money to put the show on. I don't know where it goes. All of it doesn't go where it's supposed to."

The last CSNY show was at Wembley Stadium in England in September of 1974. "Sometime," says Young, "we'll do something again in some combination."

After a brief vacation, Young returned to Los Angeles to begin another album, this one meant to be "the other side of Harvest." The resulting LP was full of the beautiful, melodic ballads his audience had been clamoring for. But the songs were mostly self-pitying, metaphorical details of the breakdown of his most recent relationship. Called Homegrown, the completed album depressed an entire room full of Young's friends when he played it for them. Someone turned the tape over and played the other side, a resequenced version of the Tonight's the Night material for a possible Broadway musical. The room began to party again. Rick Danko, of the Band, challenged Young to put Tonight's the Night out instead. He did.

The album was initially panned by many critics, but by the end of that year, Tonight's the Night turned up on the best-ten lists of the same critics for whom Neil Young had once symbolized a near comatose laid-back chic.

Says Young today: "It took two years to make it sound like it was made in one night. Everyone thought we'd done this great work. And it still didn't sell. For me, a perfect album."

IN THE SPRING OF 1975, DAYLIGHT seemed to be breaking through on Neil Young's artful decline. He recovered the missing Les Paul played on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and Billy Talbot called to say he might have finally found a Crazy Horse guitarist worthy of Danny Whitten. Young turned up at Talbot's Silver Lake home with guitar in hand and heard Frank Sampedro for the first time. Staying for a week, Young played with the refurbished Crazy Horse and wrote material for Zuma.

"Zuma was breaking free of the murk," says Young. "My best records are the ones with Crazy Horse. They're the most fluid. Zuma was a great electric album coming from a place where pop leaves rock & roll."

After finishing the album, Neil Young and Crazy Horse toured the world. "We played England, Japan, everywhere except America," says Talbot. "It was an idyllic time, man, Neil was just sparkling. We had a band again. I heard us playing like I knew nobody else could play. I remember in Rotterdam, coming offstage and seeing Paul McCartney standing there. We'd just finished the set, the four of us are running through this wind tunnel to get back to the dressing room, and McCartney's just standing there. He nods at me like, you know, musician to musician. I just kept thinking . . . four of us. Four of them. Have we got a band or what? I don't think we've come down from that tour yet.

"I have this tape from Japan. Compared to this tape, Zuma sounds like a bunch of guys sleeping in big, fat armchairs, smoking pipes. Whenever I feel down, I listen to that tape."

Sampedro shakes his head. "Some shows Neil gets crazy with the guitar," he smiles. "Way crazy."

During a break before the world tour was to continue throughout America, Young found time to begin a long-discussed album with Stephen Stills in Miami. After the project (Long May You Run) was completed, Young took Stills and band on the tour that had been originally planned for Crazy Horse.

"Stephen asked Neil to do it," says Elliot Roberts, "and Neil said yes. He loves Stephen. They're the oldest of friends . . . and think about it. In ten years, you'll be happy to see anybody you've known that long."

But after mixed reviews and the onset of a throat ailment, Young left the tour in Atlanta, with a telegram saying: "Dear Stephen, funny how some things that start spontaneously, end that way. Eat a Peach, Neil."

NEIL YOUNG, WHO WRITES virtually all the time, can look back and find all the movements of his life and career documented in his songs, some more cryptically than others. "My songwriting process has never changed," he explains briefly, as if talking too much about it might betray the muse. "I never try to write. I know when it's there. I hear a bell ringing in my head and I just leave . . . but I don't try. Sometimes three months can go by . . ."

Some artists, I point out, have been known to get writer's blocks that last for years.

"Well, if that happens to me," says Young, "I'll take up gardening."

One afternoon during a tour several years ago, Young sat in his manager's hotel room. The phone kept ringing, tour crew members bustled in an out . . . and through it all, Young sat on the bed with his son Zeke, peacefully watching the news.

The broadcast was interrupted by an emergency bulletin. Pat Nixon had suffered a stroke, an announcer said over a filmed report of the sad and beaten Richard Nixon tearily moving through the hospital's revolving doors. After a time, Young got up and disappeared into his bus in the parking lot. Onstage several hours later, Young played the song he had written:

Hospitals have made him cry
But there's always a freeway in his eye
Though his beach got too crowded for a stroll.
Roads stretch out like healthy veins
And wild gift horses strain the reins
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul.

The song was a first called "Requiem for a President." Young later changed the name to "Campaigner," and placed it on his three-record retrospective album, Decade. "Guess I felt sorry for [Nixon] that night," he said of the song while traveling on his bus the next year, just as 300,000 copies of Decade were being prepared for release within the week. "That album was a chance to use some of the unreleased material. Hopefully it's a greatest-hits album that's more like an album." Young laughed. "Should be timeless."

I wondered when he'd decided his first decade was over. He thought about that.

"Well," he said, "I'm not sure it's over."

He was silent for a long while. I drifted back to a bunk to watch television. Young joined me after a few minutes and stared at the screen intently.

"Listen to me," he said, eyes revitted to the tube. "What if I just save Decade for a year, then put out a new album. The new stuff sounds so good – I've got this song called "Hurricane" that just soars – I think I'd feel better releasing something new. It's not time to look back yet.

I looked over at Young, who had obviously made up his mind and was now fully enjoying The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. A few minutes later, Young went to the front of the bus to make a call on a mobile phone. "Elliot?" I could hear him say. "Here goes another album . . ."

In two short days, Warner Bros. President Mo Ostin and Executive Vice-President Ed Rosenblatt had flown to the next stop along the tour to discuss delaying Decade with Young. Neil played them most of an album he'd already recorded and titled American Stars 'n Bars ("because one side is about American folk heroes and the other is about getting loose in bars"). They honored his wishes to postpone Decade a year in favor of the new album.

By the time American Stars n' Bars was released four months later, Young's prolific songwriting nature had completely altered the album to include a side of new music "written fast and in the spirit of country music," performed with Crazy Horse and the Saddlebags – singers Nicolette Larson and Linda Ronstadt.

Several of the still-unreleased songs from Stars 'n Bars – "Powderfinger", "Captain Kennedy" and "Sedan Delivery" – were sent to Lynyrd Skynyrd for possible use on their Street Survivors album. None of the songs fit the tone of the album but singer Ronnie Van Zant was saving "Powderfinger" for a future LP at the time of his fatal plane crash. Van Zant and Young had sent messages of mutual admiration for each other, but Neil never got to tell the man who wrote "I hope Neil Young will remember / Southern Man don't need him around anyhow" that "Sweet Home Alabama" was one of his favorite songs.

"I'd rather play 'Sweet Home Alabama' than 'Southern Man' anytime," Young says. "I first heard it and really liked the way they played their guitars. Then I heard my own name in it and thought, 'Now this is pretty great . . .'"

IN THE SUMMER OF 1977, A RUMOR SHOT through California music circles that Neil Young was appearing nightly in the bars around Santa Cruz. It was disregarded by most as typical gossip, but a trip up the coast one Friday night found a crowd milling around the entrance to a small bar called the Catalyst. The marquee simply read: DUCKS. Inside, the place was filled with the dull roar of zoo people quacking and blowing duck calls.

After a while, out wandered four musicians. On lead guitar was Young, his painter's hat pulled down low. The Ducks opened with a scorching version of "Mr. Soul" and played through an hour of simple, hard Chuck Berry-esque rock & roll. The songs, only a few of which were Young's, celebrated trucks, girls and bars. The Ducks became a secret, local institution. For a buck, you came in and Neil Young burned up the frets, then joined you at the bar for a drink.

Young had turned up in Santa Cruz to visit an old friend from the Springfield days, singer/songwriter Jeff Blackburn. Once part of the San Francisco duo Blackburn and Snow, he'd been playing around the quiet coastal town with a band that included ex-Moby Grape member Bob Mosley and drummer Johnny C. Craviotto. When the group lost its lead guitarist, Young joined up. They decided to call themselves the Ducks and within weeks every duck call within miles had been purchased.

"These guys play some great music," Neil told one local. "Sure they want to go out and do something, but all I want to do is play some music right now, and not go out and do anything. You see, I haven't lived in a town for eight years. I stayed on my ranch for about four years and then I just started traveling all over, never really staying anywhere. Moving into Santa Cruz is like my reemergence back into civilization. I like this town. If the situation remains cool, we can do this all summer long."

This exchange was later written up as a front-page story in a local newspaper. Crowds began to arrive from everywhere. Record companies even sent scouts. Word got out about the house that the band lived in. There was a robbery. And one day Neil Young disappeared again.

"I still have the team spirit," said Jeff Blackburn when I called him recently. "It's almost hard to comprehend it ever happened. We all knew Neil had commitments and everything . . . I guess we were in the fairy tale and unable to see out of it."

After the Ducks episode, Young had taken his son Zeke for a cross-country ride in his tour bus. They ended up in Nashville and Neil decided to begin his next record there. Young rounded up a crew of sidemen that included country session musicians who had never played anything resembling rock, a singer – Nicolette Larson – he had worked with on American Stars 'n Bars, and six acoustic guitarists. Young began his most accessible and ultimately best-selling album since Harvest. "I was feeling pretty sunny," he recalls.

Nicolette Larson had kept a tape of some of the material from when she and Neil first met and sang together at her friend Linda Ronstadt's house. When the phone call came from Nashville, she was ready. Young barely had to show her the songs before they were singing the duets that appear on the album.

The Gone with the Wind Orchestra, as the entire conglomeration of twenty-two musicians was called, lasted throughout the album and for one live performance, on Young's thirty-second birthday, at an outdoor benefit for children's hospitals in the Miami Beach area. Young rehearsed the outfit in a Nashville storefront and flew everyone to Florida where, sharing the windy stage with Nicolette, he played what could well have been his purest and most note-perfect performance ever. The show ended with Young playing part of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama," which he dedicated to "a couple of friends in the sky."

A visit to Young's house in Zuma Beach a month later found him and Nicolette in floppy sweaters before the fireplace – Ma and Pa Kettle at home. Young made some coffee, put on the tape, and they sang with themselves while Comes a Time played. On the living-room table was the then-current issue of People, with the re-formed Crosby, Stills and Nash on the cover.

"Strange seeing that," said Young. "Those three with Jimmy Carter on the inside . . . it makes me think. It's good that they're together, but it's also good to be apart too. They all must feel sometimes like getting away from it. Just like when I'm someplace and decide, 'Think I'll get on the bus and go.' I have to be able to go . . ."

YOUNG IS IN ELLIOT ROBERTS' office a year later, rubbing the two-day beard he's grown since the end of the Rust Never Sleeps shows. The tour had ended in L.A., the night after a raging coastal fire had swept through Zuma Beach and gutted Young's house. All that was left was the stone fireplace.

"Beautiful house," Young says. "Burned to the ground."

I have the impression that if the house had to go, the imagery suits Young just fine. That evening a year before, listening to Comes a Time with him an Nicolette, seems like it's from another time and place entirely.

"People don't understand sometimes," he says, looking down at a pencil he's toying with, "how I can come in and go out so fast, how I can be there and want to do something and then when it's over, for me it's over. To other people it's just a beginning. Sometimes that's hard for people to take. I can see how that would be. I just don't like to stay in one place very long. I move around, I keep doing different things . . ." He looks up. "Just different things."

It must be difficult, I wonder, to decide which impulses to follow.

"I only follow the ones I get," says Young. "And if it makes me laugh . . . I know it's a good one. Basically I've had a really good time, even though my songs have mostly expressed the down side. I like that there's a lot of humor in rock & roll now. A lot of people take me so seriously. They don't know what to do with me not taking myself so seriously anymore. I guess it's just that a lot of people from the Sixties and early Seventies . . ." the old smirk . . . "just aren't that funny."

To many of his own fans Neil Young is still the antithesis of humor. He is the dishelved loner, a space case, a drug casualty. . . .

"Burned out," adds Young helpfully. "Weird. I think I have a pretty healthy image. Just gives me a chance to catch everybody off guard."

Two times I’ve had to call Neil with reports of his death,” says Roberts. “One time his father called me. Said that he’d read in the AP that Neil died and was it true. Another time Warner Bros. called me and said was there any truth to Neil’s demise in Paris. Both times they were ‘drug accidents.'”

“Right,” says Young. “I was traveling on the highway and was hit by a huge drug truck.”

One of Young’s long-standing jokes is that he’s saving his best material for his “Bus Crash” album. The few who have heard samplings of Young’s tape vaults – songs that didn’t fit into the flow of his albums, entire unreleased works, live tapes, Buffalo Springfield tapes – agree that some of his most compelling performances are among the unreleased material.

“All those songs,” he says, “they’re still there. They’re there. And they’re in an order. They’re not gone. But, you know, they’re old songs. Who wants to hear about it. They’re depressing. They are. It’s like ancient history to me. I don’t want to have to deal with that stuff coming out.”

“Until,” I ask, “you’re not around to deal with them coming out?”

“That’s right,” he says. “Then they’re there. I think every artist plans for the future like that. I have things in a certain order, so that if anything ever happened to me it would be pretty evident what to do.”

A FEW DAYS LATER, PHOTOGRAPHER Joel Bernstein and I are to meet Young and his new wife Pegi at Elliot Roberts’ home in the wilds of northern California. The screen door opens and a disturbed-looking, wild-eyed Neil Young bolts in.

“Did you read,” he all but hisses, “that article in Time magazine about me and Bob Dylan. I’d like to make a comment about that.”

The Time writer had caught both Young’s and Dylan’s shows when they recently played Madison Square Garden back to back, and compared the artists according to their most current tours. The verdict was that Dylan had slipped into the billow sleeves of middle age and now “sometimes looks as if he is auditioning for the Gong Show.” Young, on the other hand, “kept closer to the ground than Dylan and sneaked into rock’s pantheon like a highwayman.”

“Show me this pantheon,” says Neil Young, pacing around his neighbor’s kitchen, insulted that he could be pitted against his own mentor. “I don’t want to have to read that shit in Time magazine. That’s irresponsible journalism. Disco attitude. Somebody somewhere is going to believe it. I did not see Dylan’s show – but to think that all he’s given, all he’s meant to us. . . you can’t cancel that in one night. . . . I don’t know how to feel.” He sits down at a table, clasping his hands. “I don’t think I want to comment at all.”

We talk of other things during the night, but the Time article seems to run through all of Young’s thoughts. To him it represents another wave of popularity, the kind that wrenched everything out of control for him before. I remind him of something he once told Peter Frampton, after meeting the English guitarist in New York when Frampton was suffering his own critical drubbing. It is the mystique that gets written about, not the music.

“Well,” says Young, staring strangely at the tape recorder whirring a few feet away from him, “as soon as you start talking about mystique, you have none.”

I knew then what would happen.

A few days later Young would call and ask that this article not be published. It had happened before. It had happened after the ROLLING STONE interview in 1975, but I had gone out of town to write the article and missed the nervous messages. It had happened after the Stills and Young tour when Young called to say he’d “been thinking a lot about maybe not having an article come out” and it happened after the 1976 tour when “the time wasn’t right.” It is hard to argue with a man whose emotions have served him so well.

“I’ve got a job to do,” Young had said at his ranch. “The Eighties are here. I’ve got to just tear down whatever has happened to me and build something new. You can only have it for so long before you don’t have it anymore. You become an old-timer . . . which . . . I could be . .  I don’t know.

“After all, it’s just me and Frank Sinatra left on Reprise Records.”

Richard Dreyfuss sat shifting his weight on a stool, face to face with an audience of 2000 Minneapolis housewives. The actor had come to tape 'The Phil Donahue Show,' to talk about his new movie, 'The Big Fix,' and maybe even to get a little zetz going with Donahue, whose political barbs during interviews had impressed him.

Instead, Donahue introduced Dreyfuss as "a real hit in this business" and began to field inquiries from the audience. Forty-five minutes later, Dreyfuss began to show signs of restlessness.

"Richard," came yet another question in a Taster's Choice testimonial voice, "you look like such a troublemaker. Did anyone ever tell you that you remind them of James Dean?"

"No," the actor replied with yet another burst of cheerful acidity. (Later, back at the hotel, I asked Dreyfuss if the two names had ever been mentioned in the same sentence before. Dreyfuss dropped his suitcase and held up a single finger. "James Dean," he said, putting his head against the wall and moaning softly. "I hate James Dean.")

Suddenly Dreyfuss acquired a different look. He clutched the hand-held mike and stood up. "Do you know," he started, pacing before the crowd, "what this is all about? I have this forum, this open line to the public just because [impressive pause] I am a star. [Another pause] You see, you should think about this. I could talk about anything. . . Richard Nixon. . . and I have the right because of this position I'm in. But how does that qualify me? Think about this. . . ."

It was as if the star had been briefly taken over by some Zulu spirit. Dreyfuss waited for a response. There was none.

"Well, that's fascinating," said Donahue. He handed the microphone over to another housewife.

"Richard," came the inquiry, "do you like the Annie Hall look or the big-cleavage and tiny-waist look?"

"Well," Dreyfuss said, "I like the first, but I love the way you put the second."

The audience howled. Dreyfuss, looking startled, surrendered to the applause. He basked in it, smiling as if to say, "Okay, so I'm another witty movie star doing 'Phil Donahue.'" Such is the dilemma of Richard Dreyfuss. Something is obviously nagging at him, telling him it's just too goddamn comfortable being Richard Dreyfuss these days.

Just thirty-one, Dreyfuss already has been seen in three of the biggest-grossing films of all time: 'American Graffiti,' 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' He has always wanted to be an actor, has always, according to nearly everyone he's ever known, been geared for success. Now he is all but synonymous with the word. Last year, after only seven features, he received his industry's highest accolade when he won the Oscar for Best Actor of 1977 (over Richard Burton) for his performance as Elliot Garfield in 'The Goodbye Girl.' "I have never," Dreyfuss proclaimed backstage that night, "paid what you might call dues."

That is what you might call exaggeration. The son of a lawyer, Dreyfuss was born in Brooklyn and raised in Beverly Hills. At the age of nine he stood up from the kitchen table, declared himself an actor and walked across the street to win an audition at the West Side Jewish Community Center. It's conceivable that he knew even then he would soon be reading it in a biography not unlike this one.

When he was twenty-one, Dreyfuss was spotted by director George Lucas in a play. His teeming intellectual energy was perfect for a role Lucas had written for 'American Graffiti.' Dreyfuss would play Curt Henderson, the scared scholar about to go off to college. He took the part to get out of Los Angeles and to forget a girl who had just broken his heart. He wrenched teen desperation out of that role — especially when he sees the Girl in the White T-Bird and pleads for Ron Howard and Cindy Williams to take off after her, saying, "You don't understand. . . somebody. . . out on the streets. . . loves me." People did not forget Richard Dreyfuss.

SIX YEARS AFTER 'AMERICAN Graffiti' and a few months before 'The Phil Donahue Show,' Dreyfuss was deep in postproduction work on 'The Big Fix,' which he produced himself with boyhood best friend/commercial filmmaker Carl Borack. The day I met him, Dreyfuss had wandered into the Universal commissary unrecognized by the hordes of Instamatic-packing tourists loitering outside. Wearing a wrinkled work shirt and dirty blue pants, his short, flat hair entirely and naturally gray, he looked like an elderly janitor.

We shook hands and Dreyfuss sat down to discuss a lingering commitment to doing the ROLLING STONE interview. Leaning forward, within inches of my face, he said, "You don't want to talk to me. I have a BAD reputation."

Indeed, Dreyfuss had all but disappeared in the months since winning the Academy Award: he dropped out of Bob Fosse's 'All That Jazz' several days before the beginning of production, costing himself $350,000 in reparations, and broke up with longtime girlfriend Lucinda Valles. People had begun to talk about the man on whom they bestowed the title Mr. New Hollywood Establishment.

"What bad reputation?" I asked.

"Don't you read? I'm an arrogant asshole. I'm a loudmouth S.O.B." I was not sure if he was genuinely hurt by the labels or if he wanted me to agree with him. Instead I told him it had been interesting talking with some of his old high-school buddies. I had some questions about him running for president of Beverly Hills High on a platform of bringing Paul Newman to the school as a speaker.

"You mean," he said, "if we did this interview, I might possibly have a chance to hear some of this stuff that people say about me . . . and respond?"

I nodded tenuously.

"You may not have enough tape for that . . . "

And so we struck a bargain. After finishing 'The Big Fix,' Dreyfuss would be leaving the Hollywood guest house of Rob Reiner, Where he had been staying. We would meet again in Manhattan and I would give him a report on his BAD reputation in exchange for the ROLLING STONE interview.

Everyone in Hollywood, it turns out, has a Richard Dreyfuss story. In most cases, the moral is the same. For some time the only person who believed in Dreyfuss was Dreyfuss. "They called him arrogant a long, long time ago," said Carl Borack. "It comes from Richard telling people he would be a success. I happen to think it's him being fucking honest. He's always believed that he was at least good."

Beyond this fact, Dreyfuss is a collection of paradoxes. He is a left-wing Social Democrat and a millionaire. He has a genius IQ and a bad school record. He is a staunch supporter of the equal rights amendment and has a reputation in the press as a womanizer ("It's just that most of my friends are women," he said).

According to some, Dreyfuss never improvises before the cameras. Others swear that he comes alive once they're rolling. "He scared me," said Teri Garr, his costar in 'Close Encounters.' "There's this one scene, and it's still in the movie, where he's digging up grass outside the window . . . and just puts his head through the glass. He had this look in his eye. It was unrehearsed, and I thought he had truly lost it. It's an incredible scene."

Nothing, however, would prepare me for my next meeting with Dreyfuss as much as a comment made by author/screenwriter Roger Simon, who has worked with Dreyfuss on "The Big Fix' for the past year. "He'd love to hear every one of your tapes," said Simon, "because he really wants to know what people think. When we ran some audience tests on 'The Big Fix,' Dreyfuss wanted to call up some of the participants and talk to them. Not the extreme ones, but the ones that had no reaction at all. He's very much a populist. He loves those Frank Capra stories where the little guy stands up for what he believes."

RICHARD DREYFUSS CAME walking through the revolving door of New York's St. Moritz Hotel with a slow swagger. Hands thrust into the pockets of a tan corduroy suit, he wore an unburdened glow. In the weeks since we'd last met I had seen all of his films again — with the exception of 'The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz' — and had begrudgingly taken on a few of his mannerisms. Like Curt Henderson's mercurial "cute. . . cute."

Dreyfuss greeted me warmly and excused himself to call a friend, who was joining us for lunch. I heard him arguing with a hotel operator. The operator hung up on him and Dreyfuss stared into the phone. "Cute," he said, "cute."

In many ways, Dreyfuss is the ultimate Richard Dreyfuss character. He is luxurious with the one-liners and even quicker with his acerbic laugh, which now identifies him in any public place. He is always thinking, always reasoning. On the streets of Manhattan, he is a hero. Most stars can walk around there in anonymity. Not Dreyfuss. As we walked down Fifth Avenue, he was accosted by hot dog vendors, people yelling "Hey, Jaws" from cars, grandmothers who pinched his cheek and told him he reminds them of a young Paul Newman ("Stop it," Dreyfuss would say, motioning wildly for more). Proud to be a man of the people, he stopped to chatter with anyone who wanted to joust with him.

We agreed to sit down in Minneapolis that night, where Dreyfuss would be flying for 'The Phil Donahue Show.' He had done one interview since winning the Academy Award, and as we were flying to Minneapolis, well, things got sticky. Dreyfuss slapped me on the arm with a rolled-up copy of 'Esquire,' featuring him on the cover with the headline: RICHARD DREYFUSS OUT OF CONTROL. "I am kissing this route goodbye," he said.

Dreyfuss was still subdued as we began our talk later that evening at the Registry Hotel in Minneapolis. He did not touch the champagne left him compliments of 'The Phil Donahue Show.' Instead, he picked at a bowl of fruit and, stretched out on a brown leatherette sofa, seriously considered each answer. At first his manner was brisk and professional, as if he was clearing every thought some intricate checklist before parting with it.

By the end of the evening, of course, he would be coming at me with an empty Perrier bottle, threatening me with passages from 'From Here to Eternity.'

* * *

IN TALKING TO THOSE around you, I get the impression that you are tremendously concerned about 'The Big Fix.' It's the first time you've made a film and acted in it yourself. Do you feel as comfortable about the finished product as you seem?
Yeah [opens mouth to show mash of grapes].

When did you last see 'The Big Fix'?
Three weeks ago in Los Angeles.

What was your feeling then?
Seventy-thirty. Little things here and there I'd change, but . . . better me make the mistakes than someone else.

Are you happy with your performance as Moses Wine?
I enjoyed playing the part, but the demands were not great in this performance. In my worst times of thinking about the experience I thought, "Well, another wiseass performance by Dreyfuss," and at best times, "Well, it's not that bad. I'm not a bad actor." The character was very close to me and it wasn't that difficult. It was, in a sense, like Curt Henderson grown up.

You had no idea it would be your follow-up performance to. . . .
To the Academy Award? Absolutely not.

Is this something you think about late at night while staring at your bedroom ceiling?
Nope [smiles ingenuously, opening mouth to show grapes again]. This is all the cooperation you're going to get.

You must have been difficult in school. 
I was a glib shitter in school. I was real smart and never did any work. I was the one they pulled into the principal's office and asked, "You have the knowledge of fourteen men, why are you getting Ds?" I literally never did homework. When it finally got to the point where I really had to expend effort, I didn't know how, I had no training. As I grew up there were two words that I could never really relate to or understand. One was work. The other was effort.

Isn't acting a matter of discipline? 
I love acting. It's not a question of discipline. I'd do it anytime . . . wake me up at three o'clock in the morning and give me a part. I'll read it. People would always call me a hard worker, a workaholic. I've always been acting, but it's all been play.

So you've gotten more serious?
That's a good word, I guess. I've started to pay attention to my life, that's all. The fact is that we all unconsciously believe we're immortal. When I realized one day that simply wasn't so, I felt this indefinable terror. I started growing up.

What did that mean in your case? 
Trying to retain those things that are childlike and dispense with those things that are childish. It sounds pompous, but that was my confusion for a long time. I created enormous problems because I did not know the difference between those two things.

What kinds of problems? 
None . . . of your business. [Disgusted pause] I thought you were going to talk about The Big Fix? [Longer, more incredulous pause] You know, one of my problems is I don't know who the fuck to talk to. I realized this on the plane today. I speak to journalists sometimes with the idea that they're my psychiatrists. Why do I do that? I imagine to get some kind of understanding back, some kind of journalistic vision . . . I always get me. I want to read what you feel about me, and you're only twenty-one. C'mon.

Richard, you ignorant bastard. . . . 
Shana, you lascivious twit. [Enter puzzled-looking bellboy with Perrier.]

You want an observation? It's always you that winds up talking about your personal crises. 
My problem is me, not you. I need a little of Robert De Niro's insecurity or hesitancy or brains or whatever it is that shuts him up.

Do you know the phenomenon of getting up on a talk show and becoming someone else? Do you know that that exists as the norm? There's a thing about knowing the eight-minute life span. Gore Vidal, Burt Reynolds, whoever it is . . . they know how to assume a posture on talk shows that has no relationship whatsoever to their real life. They get out there, hey, they know how to get the name of the book or film out there every thirty seconds. It's a mathematical process and hey, Johnny, I got a list of anecdotes, BOOM. Now, I didn't go to that school. If I'd known the course was offered, I would have taken it. All my life I'm taught by my family to keep it going, don't get boring at the dinner table. When I learned I could do that by just being honest, whole vistas of trouble opened up. I get on a talk show, I get talking and whoa! Trouble city! For me, not for you. Not for Mike Douglas. He loves it.

Truthfully now, how hard is it for you to come up with those show-business anecdotes? Surely you're sitting there thinking, "This guy is going to ask me about 'Jaws,' 'Close Encounters'." . . . 
[Very sincerely] Not really. I'll tell you when my stock answers come, when people ask me about my past. How did you start in this business? WellIwassittingwithmymotheratthekitchentablandsaidIwanttobeanactor, shesaiddon'tjusttalkaboutitsoIgotupandauditionedforaplayattheWest SideJewishCommunityCenter . . . boring. When it gets to the later stuff, in terms of my interior monologue, my interior perspective, I don't have any raps down. My attitudes about things I've done five years ago have changed completely. I would feel like a liar if I had raps down.

So what's in the notebook? Give me a little zetz. 

A friend of yours said this about you: "Ricky's a true believer, an enthusiast. He will take something on faith; it's a very trusting and vulnerable thing. If somebody he trusts presents a facile argument or a well-reasoned opinion, he will adapt it without really thinking it through. Then, if somebody presents a conflicting viewpoint that's equally facile, he gets shot down real quick. He is a believer and that makes Dreyfuss a great actor." Do you agree with that?
That's a facile argument, I'll go along with that. I want to hear every comment in there.

Here's another one: "Dreyfuss has never sat down and made a five-year plan for himself in his entire life." Have you?
No.

So you've just careened into whatever direction was most attractive? 
Absolutely. I always had a general overview of where I was going, but I never had a five-year plan. I had a twelve-year plan. And this was it. Real simple. From the time I was twelve to the time I was eighteen, I knew I would be a star when I was thirty-two. Okay? All that means is I'd do TV and theater and travel around the country with plays and I'd be a star.

By the time you were attending Beverly Hills High School you were already appearing on 'Mod Squad,' 'Room 222'. . . .
Oh yeah, I did a lot of prime-time shit. Judd for the Defense, Gidget, Please Don't Eat the Daisies. I was a success, but it was an absolutely irrelevant term to me. I knew what a movie star was and that was over there. I was just apprenticing and having fun. "You mean $325 is the minimum? I'm not allowed to make any less? O-kay."

Would you have been shattered if the success never came? 
People who don't become successful didn't have the right ambition. Or they didn't wait long enough. Paul Ford didn't become a star until he was forty-five. So I admit to it being an incredible amount of luck. My luck is eerie. It's the eeriest luck I've ever seen. I'm just trying to deal with the world as it presents itself to me day to day, which is only lately becoming half as much fun as dealing with the whole thing as a fantasy [laughs].

Was it depressing, then, to realize that you'd already achieved the life dreams of most actors when you were only thirty?
It was thrilling. After Duddy Kravitz and Jaws, people would say, "Richard, you're a star." I would say, "No, I'm not. I'm a commodity." I'll know when I'm a star.

I'll tell you what a star is: I'm riding in a cab with my mother in New York and we see Radio City Music Hall. She looks at the theater and says, "Robin and Marian, what's that about?" I say, "You know, Robin and Marian, later on." She says, "Sounds boring . . . oh, Audrey Hepburn! I'll see that!" That's a star. When I felt, after Goodbye Girl, that I'd become a star, I felt real good, not real bad.

What has been stardom's greatest benefit?
Power. It means having the ability to choose what you do rather than be told. That's the best part of being a star. I've never looked down on being a star. I never dreamed about the Academy Award, oddly enough, but I always dreamed about being a star and being this great stage and film actor. I got, not sidetracked by the events of the last six years, but they led me toward one thing. I never just wanted to be a film star . . . racquetball player, restaurateur.

Has your stage experience put you ahead of most film actors?
There are times when I think I'm real good and there are other times, happily not as often as the other, when I think, "When is someone going to tap me on the shoulder and say, 'Oh no, we've made an enormous error, you're terrible . . . go back to unemployment'?" I can't isolate that feeling through my experience as a stage actor. I don't think of stage acting as a background. I think of it as something in my present.

Do you miss having a certain underdog charm? You are no longer a supporting actor. Do you enjoy the pressure of a leading role?
I did a tour of a play once with Henry Fonda. We were in Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. For four months I was with Henry Fonda every day. I said maybe fifty words to this man. I was so in awe of him, I was so tied up around this man. Henry Fonda. He actually spoke in Washington at the American Film Institute. They were doing a tribute to him, and he answered stuff that I would have loved to ask him in private. I learned more in this public meeting than in months on the road with him. One of the things he said was that he never wanted to be a star. This is the man who had been a star from the MOMENT he came to Hollywood in 1934. Bingo. He's a star for more than forty years. He said he always liked being a supporting actor. I thought, "Awwww, bullshit." Now I know what he means. Supporting actors get the best scenes, they usually die — which is fun — and the weight of it is not on their shoulders. [Pause] Well, I never wanted to be a supporting actor.

What about your reputation? Most everyone you've worked with said they enjoyed the experience. Even Jeremy Paul Kagan, director of 'The Big Fix,' said, "He has a bad reputation because he tells people he has a bad reputation." 
Not true. I have a difficult reputation and I don't know where it comes from. And yes, I always talk about my difficult reputation because I'm fascinated by it. People are always saying to me, "Boy, you have a bad reputation," and I say, "What is it?" and they all say, "I don't know."

Where do you think it comes from?
I don't have the slightest fucking idea.

It seems to bother you that people find you arrogant. During interviews you say things like, "I always knew I'd be a star."
I don't know why that's taken as arrogance. You know, the funny thing about being arrogant and all that shit . . . I probably am more insecure and more publicly self-denigrating than any other person I've ever fucking known. But because I've also said the opposite, that's all they hear.

Are you usually surprised by the way people react to you?
Constantly. I'm surprised when people don't like me. I'm surprised when they do. I mean, I am the guy that's sitting here talking to you. It comes out and it is what it is. But I'll tell you, it hurts to read I'm an S.O.B. or a loudmouth. I mean, if it turns out that I'm the asshole you read about, I don't want to know. 

If you had been an actor under the contract system of the Thirties, like John Wayne, Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable, you would have done maybe a hundred feature films by the time you were sixty. These days people criticize actors for having all the power: they organize packages around themselves rather than act with other strong actors. How do you feel about that? 
I certainly think my expertise as an actor would have been far greater if I'd been forced to do six movies a year. But I am only alive now. The audience is a whole different animal. They're used to free experiences, television. You can get awfully sick of paying four dollars every film, seeing the same guy four times a year, unless they're real different roles. Spencer Tracy won two Academy Awards, in '37 and '38, for Captains Courageous and Boys Town. In between he did four other movies. Six movies in a year and a half. Okay? Elliott Gould did six films in two years. People got sick of Elliott Gould real quick. That's too bad. Elliott Gould is a good actor.

How carefully do you choose your roles now?
Carefully. When I decided to do Moses Wine, I had not thought of the overview of my body of work. What I was literally divining of was, "What do Carl [Borack] and I first produce?" I turned to Carl one day and said, "You don't know Roger Simon, do you? He's got this project and why don't we do it together?" Put it on the back of my acting and we're off. We have our dream. It wasn't until after The Big Fix was finished that I'm walking down the street in New York and I thought, "Now, wait a minute, isn't there a certain common denominator in my work that I'm a little uncomfortable with?"

You're aware of a Richard Dreyfuss type?
The wiseass urban intellectual. All the roles I get now are the Cabbie with the Big Mouth. The Harvard Assistant with the Wiseass Response. The Newspaper Guy with the Fast Quip . . . rackarackarack. It's time for something new.

Are you thinking about a major departure for your next role?
I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm thinking about the Heisenberg theory: the act of observing the phenomenon changes the phenomenon itself. I don't know what I'm going to do next.

In the past, much has been made of the fact that you are the Everyman movie star. One friend of yours said: "He's never been afraid of playing an unflattering vision of himself. Dreyfuss is unafraid of getting vulnerable in unpleasant areas. He'll appear unshaven and shitty-looking. The only thing he won't appear as is paunchy." [Dreyfuss winces.] Now you've lost a lot of weight; you play the romantic lead in 'The Big Fix.' Do people really want to see Richard Dreyfuss looking this handsome?
[Laughs] Who was the cunt bitch who said that about me? I don't care what people say, but who was the fucking prick cock-sucker who said that?

Your old buddy who wrote the screenplay for 'Jaws,' Carl Gottlieb. 
Okay, thank you, Carl. Mark him.

I was once told, very recently in fact, in a script I'm considering that the character is plump. I said, "If I can manage to get thin, fuck being plump." And this guy said, "Well, this character is plump." I said, "Verisimilitude be damned. I'd rather put on pillows."

How did you lose the weight?
Liquid protein . . . boring. Can I have a look at those quotes?

Is there truth to the rumor that you ran for class president at Beverly High, promising that you would get Paul Newman to speak at the school? 
Thought that would win me the election. I lost by one vote. We were asking for an investigation of the election and the principal said, "Richard, how do you think it would look if there was an article in the L.A. Times saying, 'Cheating found in Beverly Hills High School elections'?" And I said, "Well, how do you think it would look if it said, 'Cheating found in Beverly Hills High School elections, nothing done about it,' sir?" Pretty smart, pretty fast.

Had you met Paul Newman? 
Nope. I just said that I would invite him.

This afternoon you ran into an old friend from grammar school walking on Fifth Avenue. You hadn't seen him, you said, since 1962. How did it feel to see him again? 
Do you know who the fuck that was? He was one of the first assholes . . . one of the first mouth-breather, jock-asshole types. He was a bully. Rob Goldman [not his real name]. Now he's got two kids, lives in Jersey. You know? I mean, ROB GOLDMAN. He used to make fun of me when I was rounding first base. "Hey, little motherfucker." [Catches himself] I don't know. I mean, I'm thirty-one years old and all that stuff is right here [points to shoulder]. My defense against Rob Goldman was my mouth. I'd say, "No, I won't meet you at the flagpole because you'll hurt me and you'll still be an asshole and what's in it for me?"

And that's when Rob Goldman busted you in the mouth?
No, he never did. He was really afraid I would chop him.

Did your parents teach you to be savvy? 
No, as a matter of fact I was drop-the-coffee Rick most of the time. That was something I learned on my own, leading this double life.

How did you react when you first saw 'American Graffiti'?
[Laughs] I really went crazy. Let me tell you, man, I was with my girlfriend Dorothy at the time and we were down on Melrose Avenue. We go into this restaurant and see a guy who worked on Graffiti. He says, "Hey, going to the screening tonight?" Now, I'm just learning about being paranoid in town, right? There's a screening tonight and they didn't invite me? [Laughs psychopathically] I went crazy.

So we raced over to Universal. We'd done the film about six months before. I go in, and as it turns out, it was a technical screening just for editing. I was the only actor there. But I sit there and I watch the movie. About ten minutes into it, I go clammy cold [gets up, starts rubbing bands together, paces the hotel room]. First of all, look. I walk around in here. I'm inside here. I'm not you looking at me. I'm inside here, looking out. All I see is the vague outline of my glasses. All of a sudden, I'm seeing me [pause] and I look like . . . a pear. I'm shaped like Smokey the Bear and I've got the profile of a gopher. And I'm hearing this awful monotonal nasal voice and I'm the worst, right? I had these Ronald Colman fantasies, and they were ripped up and dispensed with in my subconscious at that moment. I watched the movie with this absolutely lunatic point of view of "How do I cut this performance out of the movie?" By the end, I had it all figured out. The lights come on and George Lucas sees me and says, "What are you doing here? What did you think of the movie?" I said [gulps, then whispers], "Well, it's a nice movie but I've already figured out how you can cut me out." Lucas told me I was crazy. They had a screening later at the Academy . . . yeah, I'm going to do that when hell freezes over. At 12:30 that night, people are calling me, telling me the audience went crazy for it. "Yeah, right, FUCK YOU." The film is going to make $50 million? Right. I never went to see the film until years later. I still love the character.

You turned down the sequel to 'American Graffiti.' Why?
Not enough money. They offered me one-tenth my salary [laughs] and I said no. I didn't ask to improve my salary, but I certainly wanted it matched, and they were unwilling to do that. I don't see any reason for me to work for less when there are people involved in the film project who make millions and millions. There's a certain phenomenon that can occur in Hollywood. If four people are being cheated and one guy says, "I don't want to be cheated," he's the bad guy. The other phenomenon is, "Hey, man, I stuck a knife in your neck, I admit, and I had the gun at your temple . . . but man, I put the gun down." I said, "Go fuck yourself." I think it's a great idea for a film and I hope it's very successful yadayadayada. I still get along with Lucas, he just won't be telling the story of Curt Henderson.

Is it Curt Henderson that people remember most? 
People remember Duddy Kravitz, actually. I mean, more people saw Jaws then there are people in the world. They still remember Duddy Kravitz.

'The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz' was your first lead. You played a very complex character, one that was manipulative and driven to lie and cheat for success. Most people point to that performance as the moment they were convinced of your talent. You, however, are very much on the record as saying you despised the performance.
Most people don't know how to watch acting.

You mean as other actors watch acting?
I admit to being totally subjective in my response to my work. But ultimately, I know. That's why I know my reaction to Duddy Kravitz is righteous. My performance is not relaxed. We didn't have time, didn't have rehearsal. When I put down that performance it's not like me being crazy. It's not like me saying I could never do it either. I can fucking A do that role and be very happy with it. I didn't have the time, I was nervous, I was insecure. I can spot it when I watch the movie. The energy level is a lie. I'm not the only person I do this to. I watch other performances and do the same thing. It's my job. I love it.

You are an ambitious man. How did you feel being likened to Duddy Kravitz? There were more than a few articles with the headline: IS RICHARD DREYFUSS DUDDY KRAVITZ?
That was cheap and easy journalism — Richard Dreyfuss is Duddy Kravitz. Everyone is Duddy Kravitz. You want to talk about acting a minute? Duddy Kravitz taught me a great lesson. Duddy Kravitz in Canada is this guy who. . . everyone knows him, everyone has read the book. He's like Holden Caulfield, except he's considered this schmucky character. I didn't know this. I read the book, I fall in love with Duddy Kravitz. I relate to Duddy Kravitz. I relate to every character I've ever done. Why did I love Duddy Kravitz? He was telling a lot of truths. He's got fears, insecurities, he's tender and, yes, he's manipulative. He's got it all and he shows it all at one time or another. I tried to get in touch with all the manipulative things I've ever done. I deny that there's a human being on earth who has never been manipulative. But I do the role and start to read articles saying I'm Duddy Kravitz. Whenever someone asked me, "Are you Duddy Kravitz?" I would say, "Yes I am, and so are you."

Do you believe that you deserve. . . . 
No, not Best Actor.

Well, that answers one question, but the one I was actually going to ask was do you think you deserve to be called great? Most people are so quick to heap on superlatives. How do you keep your perspective?
I make up for most of the criticism that is lacking right now. I have given some performances I'm quite proud of — Boy Wonder in Inserts, Elliot Garfield in Goodbye Girl — but I haven't given the performance, you know, that had you standing for the bow. It just hasn't happened. [Pause] Ed McMahon was once describing the perfect martini. He went through this whole analysis of this martini he'd made. It was so good that he made two. And as he lifted one up to drink, the light came in the window and God picked up the other one. [Pause] So, no, God has not applauded one of my performances yet.

They say that as soon as you hear your name called out for an Academy Award, an incredible experience happens. You accept it, and before it's even sunk in, they've whisked you off into a room backstage full of reporters and photographers. Then they take the Oscar away from you for engraving and lead you back out to sit among the same people. As if nothing happened. 
Well, first of all, they never took the Oscar away from me. I still have it in a bank vault and it's not engraved. I went back to New York with it in my hand and it wasn't until I was back in L.A. five months later that someone said, "The Academy called and they never got your Oscar for engraving."

It's true that from the second they call your name it becomes a series of still photos, very much like slides presented about your summer vacation. Shoosh. Up onstage. Shoosh. Mouth open. Shoosh. Backstage. Shoosh. Walking to the elevator to go back to the main floor. You're gaga. And I must say that the surprise about the Academy Award is that over the last April, May, June, July, August, September — six months — I've gotten, on occasion, whiffs of absolute happiness. They just go flooding through my brain. I'm real proud of it. [Laughs excitedly] Goddamn, I won the American Academy Award for Best Actor of '77. I mean . . . I was real thrilled. Still am.

Do you know that in one year I got the Academy Award, the Drama Critics Award, the Hasty Pudding Award, the Golden Globe, the David di Donatello [Italian award for Best Foreign Actor]. That's five, right? Until that year I had never won anything ever. I was the best actor at Beverly High. Everyone knew that. I never won. Greg Findley [now doing commercials] won Best Actor. I was a funny guy, but Albert Brooks was funnier. In school, his name was Albert Einstein. I came in third for every award at Beverly High in 1965. Then, in one year . . . ooooooo, ahhhhhh. Thank you.

Did you run into any of the other Best Actor nominees after you'd won the Oscar? 
No. I ran into John Travolta before. He came back behind me and said good luck. I wished him good luck, too.

Did you see 'Saturday Night Fever'?
No. [Sue Di Puccio, Dreyfuss' assistant, who was sitting in on the conversation, added, "Tell him about Jack Nicholson."] I had just won the Oscar, right. I get in the elevator to go back downstairs. Jack Nicholson gets into the elevator. There's me, a few other actors. Nicholson stands at the back, adjusting his shades, saying nothing. Then, just as the doors are about to open, he says to me, "Bet you're glad I didn't make a film this year." I was.

So you took the role in 'Jaws' because you were depressed and afraid that it would be your only offer after the supposed debacle of 'Kravitz.'
Yes. I went with the fish movie.

How do you look back on the experience? 
Jaws was good work. Memories. [Imitates megaphone] The ship is sinking. The ship is sinking. The shark is working. The shark is working.

In Jaws, we all lived and wrote that movie together. We sat and improvised and Carl [Gottlieb] would go away and write a scene and he would come back and we would rewrite that whole scene using Carl's as an outline. Every night for three months.

Supposedly you walked into the 'Jaws' casting room at a hotel in Boston, and Steven Spielberg looked at you and said, "Perfect. Get three more of what you're wearing from wardrobe."
Well it wasn't quite that dramatic. I was cast in the film three days before shooting started. I had already turned it down three times. All I did was get a lot of books about sharks and marine biology. We talked about it for a day in Boston, I said okay and called my agent, Meyer [Mishkin], to say, "You can start negotiating."

I was once in a situation where I walked into a room and people said, "That's Benjy," and I turned it down fuckin' cold. Soon as they said the word Beniy, I knew exactly what the character was. In television there was a certain classification known as the Dipshit Friend. I was always playing the Dipshit Friend. They had names like Lionel and Alfred. My brother says they're the characters who wear a size-nine belt because they wear their pants up here [points to neck].

Even after 'Jaws' had made $200 million, you were still living in Silverlake, California. Takeout food was everywhere. Week-old pizza, empty Courvoisier bottles, half-eaten hamburgers . . . shall I go on?
I lived that way for fifteen years. Except for the cognac, that was only two years old. I'm a known slob.

You're wearing suits now.
Like this? I have no idea what I'm wearing. I just wanted to start dressing my age. I used clothing as a device to keep young. I looked like a slob: "It's okay, you don't have to respect me, I'm just a kid." So I'd have to work double hard to get them to respect me. Now I just want my clothes to reflect whoever I am. 

You are constantly plagued with dog analogies. People say you have a puppy dog way of gaining endearment. Even the 'New Yorker,' in Pauline Kael's review of 'The Big Fix,' said Dreyfuss "acts like a puppy surprising his master with little tricks he's thought of all by himself." Does this bother you?
I'd love to talk to you about this, but I have to go visit the fire hydrant. I feel a number one coming on.

Are you surprised that women, especially since Elliot Garfield, find you attractive?
[Nods vigorously] For a long time, women have said things to me like, "Why didn't we sleep together?" Well, why didn't you ask me? I don't read that very well. I've got a lot of normal or slightly abnormal male insecurities. My father once said . . . I told him I was sick and tired of being precocious and wanted to grow up. He said, "You want to be an adult, huh? Adulthood is a myth. The only thing that an adult knows that you don't is that they know how to keep their mouths shut." People writhe in insecurities until they're eighty. Silence has an incredible power. I've got to learn that.

What constitutes a good love scene in a script?
I think seriousness is a prime factor. At least for me, when there's a lot of laughing going on, it just doesn't get me aroused. Other people are different. A big yuk gets them hard . . . not me.

Did you write anything in 'Close Encounters'?
One speech. They cut it out.

Did you know you were in a race with 'Star Wars' when making the film?
No. Steven may have, I didn't. I still think that if we had come out first, we would have done better.

There's always the sequel.
I've got a lot of sequels to deal with. I'll tell you, I was never very comfortable playing Roy Neary in Close Encounters. It was my greatest departure, so it attracted me. I'm not a person who grew up liking the word challenge, but in a willy-nilly way I'd like to try the character again. Roy Nearly is not in the sequel. So I guess Spielberg's taken it out of my hands. [Pause] I would have gotten on board.

What was the atmosphere on the set? So much was made of the top-secret locations.
Hot. Real Hot. I spent most of the time in my dressing room, which was air-conditioned. And I had a Pong game, so the crew spent a lot of time in my dressing room. [Laughs] Steven spent a lot of time playing Pong with me.

Are these your most vivid recollections? 
There's nothing more boring than shooting a movie. I mean, you don't stand there and watch fascinating things happen. It's more like you stand on the set and [looks wonderously at the ceiling] they pay you enormous amounts of money to do this. You read a script and you know what it's going to be a year later. That's when you get excited.

When was the last time you were broke?
I've always been broke. I was broke until Close Encounters.

Do you consider Spielberg a close friend?
Yeah, well, I like to think so. Steven is a very private guy, and I also think that I'm the one who's wanted to be more friends with him than he wants to be with me. And his girlfriend says, "God, Steven's always complaining that you don't come over enough and you don't really like him." Steven's like me, except he shuts up.

Have you noticed that I imitate Steve Martin? I've been doing this against my will for about a year now.

At this point, though, it's some strange dialect all your own.
Listen, I imitate Spencer Tracy and Jimmy Stewart but nobody knows I'm doing it. There are certain things that I do steal. I walk backward like Marlon Brando walks backward, did you know that? What were we talking about?

Let's talk about other actors. What do you think of Nicholson's work? 
Incredible. His greatest role so far, The Last Detail. I don't even love One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest as much as I love The Last Detail. It was a mindfucker. Pacino . . . Serpico. De Niro?

I used to want to be the greatest actor on earth. Then I saw Mean Streets. "Who is this person who's destroyed my life? Who is Robert De Niro and when is he going to get hit by a truck?"

Do you tell other actors when their work has affected you?
Shit, are you kidding? When I first met De Niro, it was like . . . Mike Medavoy [West Coast production head of United Artists at the time] said, "Robert De Niro, Richard Dreyfuss . . . Richard Dreyfuss, Robert De Niro." [Affects cool] "Hi, how are you?" Then I went, "Oh, God, I can't be polite, man. I think you're great." The greatest actor of our generation.

As a little kid I used to go see Beckett all the time — Burton and O'Toole. Well, it's be a cold day in hell when anyone is as good as Dustin Hoffman was in Midnight Cowboy. And Jon Voight. Those two burn in that film. I'm going to go see Nick Nolte in Who'll Stop the Rain. Everybody tells me he's great in that. Gary Busey in The Buddy Holly Story. I'd like to work with all of them . . . put us in a movie together. In the Thirties and Forties, every studio was like another dutchy. Now it's the actors who are separate dutchies. Bullshit. I'd like to work with Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Gary Busey, Nick Nolte, Jon Voight. Let's all work together. Jane Fonda, Sissy Spacek, Carrie Fisher. . . .

Whoa. You say your fee is over $1 million. . . . 
There are other ways to finance a film. Lots of ways. I'm always willing to work for less if the financier is still splitting fifty percent. I don't want to hear that they're the only ones taking a risk. My career is on the line every goddamn time I make a film. Their money is, too, thank you very much, but they've got it all locked up with TV and sales and territory. Don't tell me about it. I know all about it. That's the thing about the last year. I learned a lot of that shit.

When did you take such an active role in your negotiations? Was there ever a point when you wanted just to be the artiste? 
Yes. Until one day I found someone with his hands on my balls and a saw in one hand. He said, "You be the artist, I'll . . . [makes sawing noises]." I said, "I'm being fucked with here, get off me." I realized that negotiations and money and all that stuff was just a way of people getting your neck in their hands.

How old were you when you realized this?
Eighteen and a half.

Do you think there will come a time when you do a film for money alone? Look at Sir Laurence Olivier in 'The Betsy.'
There already has been. I once worked only for money. I used to say I'd never work for money. Talk is cheap. Someone came to me and said $50,000 a day for five days. And when I woke up, I was doing Raid on Entebbe. I hope I'll never do that again, but I'll never say never. And about Olivier, the English don't look at that the way we do. British actors finance a stage career by working in movies.

It sounds like you can't wait to get back onstage.
I'd like to be the best actor in the world, man. I would . . . wouldn't you like to be the greatest writer on earth? Well fuckin' A. 

You have been associated very strongly with success and popular projects. What do you think of the quote "Nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public"? 
That's bull puckey. It's true and it's not true. The same person can turn around and act intelligently.

Here's a quote from an executive you've worked with: "I really respect what Richard's doing. He's getting into areas where his knowledge is superficial — ad campaigns, theater bookings, legalities. He's out of his league producing films, though. He's dealing with a corporate system that goes back fifty years. No way he's going to learn it the first time out. I don't think he's prepared to eat the humble pie he may have to eat."
[Long silence] Well, I think I am prepared to eat that humble pie. 

Jeremy Kagan tells a story about showing you 'The Big Fix' for the first time. He wasn't really ready, he said, but the time had come to show you a rough cut. You sat there, acted out the part with yourself and when it was over, you excused yourself to go to the bathroom. When you returned you said you liked it. Did you go to the bathroom to think about your reaction? 
I went to the bathroom because I had to go to the bathroom. I'm watching the movie and I realize for the first time it's my movie. It wasn't Steven's. It wasn't [Goodbye Girl director] Herb Ross'. It was mine. Listen I don't like giving interviews, but you do it, you do it right. There was a certain moment I looked at Big Fix and said, "This thing needs work." Either you do the work or you throw up your hands and silently slip away into the night. Well, I have no intention of doing that. On reading Arthur Schlesinger's book on Robert Kennedy I realized he knew how to get the truth. Bobby Kennedy knew how to say, "All right, thank you, but what's the real story here?" When I was younger, I had a thing about if I didn't do anything well, I never did it more than once. Well, I'm learning. We made mistakes. But we also did okay. It doesn't help when someone says, "Hey, it's great." They're doing it to be nice, to be kind, whatever. That's why I don't go to previews. There's a real danger of not hearing the things you should be hearing. On the other side, I've got a personality that seeks the negative.

What was so pleasurable about 'The Goodbye Girl'? 
When I look at a film, I don't see just the performance. I remember the days I shot the film. I still can look at moments on the big screen and not like what I see because I was in a real bad mood that day. I can see the day. Well, I loved every day of Goodbye Girl. I loved who I worked with. I loved Herb Ross, I loved Marsha Mason, loved Neil Simon. To me, good work on any level is based on relaxation. I got to a level of relaxation I'd never been to on that film. And that's what I see in Elliot Garfield, too. Also, he's the nicest person in the world. I have never had any pretensions to be Steve McQueen or Mr. Virility or Mr. Grotesque or Mr. Anything. Elliot Garfield is totally human and he's kind and good and intelligent and witty and sweet and lovable. Who wouldn't want to play that?

You have many of the same mannerisms and facial expressions as Elliot Garfield.
If you are trying to get me to say I am all of those things, of course I am. I am also insensitive, manipulative, rotten, cruel. It's a question of if the actor's honest he finds it in himself.

Do you think it's amateurish for an actor to think tragic thoughts to prepare for a serious scene? 
Fuck no. I think anything that works for an actor is absolutely valid.

What is your method for a separating your own reality from that of a character?
I don't have any method. Sometimes it's easy and sometimes it's not. What I do is believe the situation of the character. There was one day in The Goodbye Girl when I just couldn't get it together. It happens to every actor.

Do you think you know what you do best?
To an extent. I can delude myself and not test myself, which is why I need a strong director. It works both ways.

Are you a perfectionist?
If I were a perfectionist, The Big Fix would never have been released. If I were a perfectionist, the film would have cost $18 million. If I were a perfectionist, I would be cut from American Graffiti, Duddy Kravitz would have been prevented from being sold in the United States and Jaws would never have been edited. That's if I were a perfectionist. I have this compulsion to say . . . I stink. I'm a professional pessimist. Blue sky out there, I'm going to say, "God, there must be a tidal wave in Japan." That's me. 

Does being ultracritical of your own work have its roots in wanting to be told you're wrong?
It may have elements of that. I also think it's a very honest way of approaching my work. You don't hear me criticizing Elliot Garfield. It's just that I'm not satisfied with my work in Duddy Kravitz. Why I'm so eager to say it all the time may have its roots in the guilt that I have felt.

Guilt over what? The fact that you've only done seven major features. . . .
Hey, I'm the luckiest motherfucker you ever met. It's amazing, it really is. Strangers think you've made them happy. I do my work and I make a lot of money and I like doing it and I do it well. It took me a long time just to be able to make that last statement. Most of my friends are much less successful.

Looking at your personal history, it seems you were always pointed for success. Then it came to you, and you found it difficult. Surely you planned for that kind of turbulence, just like you had planned to be a star in the first place.
Life has a subtlety all its own. [Pause] And I'm not a very subtle guy. I didn't anticipate any of it. You know, we all grow up being the center of our universe and that's it. All of a sudden you become the center of everyone else's universe. That makes you crazy. That will begin to really get to you and make you frightened and insecure and nuts. You need privacy. I went through a very long, hard, painful period of self-denigration and self-loathing and guilt and yeah, yeah, all right . . . I'm out of that now.

You talk very openly about being in therapy. 
I don't mind people knowing. It's the dwelling on, the taking out of context and blowing out of proportion, that makes me crazy.

Even you use that word — crazy. It's in nearly every profile about you. Zany. . . crazy. . . . 
Oh, that's all shit. Crazy's relative. Look, everyone's not healthy, okay? I'm not totally healthy inside. The easy way of saying that is crazy. It's cheap and it's easy to quote. And it's also my sense of humor. I've never looked at therapy as something to do because I was going off the deep end. Therapy has helped me in my list of priorities. It's just someone giving you a sounding board.

Do you worry about sustaining your popularity?
Those thoughts really don't occur to me. You work because of the work, not to maintain a career. I'm in an insanely wonderful position. I can fall back on making a million and a half. It's nice. It's weird. I certainly don't plan to make six bad films in a row. I certainly don't wake up in the middle of the night going, "Oh my God." People either like it or they don't. If you know what you're doing, you're going to do good work. Listen to me. Ask me in three years when my next three films go right into the toilet. It's easy for me to talk about this now, I don't know shit.

Your next film will be a sequel to 'The Goodbye Girl,' won't it?
Yeah, and that is not a departure, obviously. I've already played that character before. The visceral reason I'm doing it is because it was such an incredibly wonderful experience that I want to do it again. I really don't know what I'm going to do in terms of stretching myself as an actor. I have certain images of a classical career, of being a classical actor with perhaps a twinge of Paul Muni. I get a pleasure out of playing characters who think well and tell the truth. There's a power in truth. I would love to update the Frank Capra ethic.

Is it easier to focus yourself when you're living alone? 
That's a personal question I choose not to answer. [Wags finger] Trying to sneak something about my personal life in there.

It's your working process. 
My working process is to say no comment.

There was a review of 'The Big Fix' that said it was a definitive portrait of Seventies cynicism. Did you see 'The Big Fix' as a means of making some kind of comment on the times?
I just wanted to expose a certain type of personality connected to the Sixties, that's all. I mean, I think that's entertaining. I am a child of the Sixties.

Were you ever a hippie? 
Took a lot of drugs. But I was never tempted to give up acting and join a commune.

Ever get the feeling that you had more fun in the Sixties? Like Moses Wine?
All the time. I mean, in terms of my living with the world . . . the reason I saw Moses Wine as a vehicle for expression was that he shows my growth away from that Seventies cynicism. I still feel it, though. The Seventies have been a much more insular, much more gracelessly selfish time, much less noble. It's funny, I've had the time of my most incredible personal success in the Seventies and I'm still hard pressed to remember what year it is. I can remember the Sixties month by month. I look at the Seventies, between '72 and '78, as a fuzz. Broken not by outside events, but by interior events. I've marked my inner calendar not by the Warren Commission or Martin Luther King, but by, "Well, I did The Goodbye Girl. I did Jaws and was going with this girl." It's not the world I'm attached to.

Maybe you're just less political.
I have become more career-oriented. But I see politics as something I will probably get back into. I've been accepted as a member of the board of the American Council for the Arts, and that deals with lobbying the government and advising on funding and organization of art councils and agencies. It's putting me back in touch with political processes.

How do you look back on lobbying for the amnesty program in 1975? You spent some time in Washington then.
I see that as a remnant of the Richard Dreyfuss that had existed ever since I was twelve. Until I got swamped with my life. I stopped being Richard Dreyfuss and started being RICHARD DREYFUSS. I'm just now getting all that away from me, and I'm coming back. Going to Washington was my last gasp of the Sixties. It was my moral idealism, and the fervor and passion of my righteous position. I thought I would turn these politicians around. Well, some very straight and honest people didn't respond to my Frank Capra plea. Ten years from now I'll know a little more about the political process in a real way.

Think you would have been blacklisted? 
Are you kidding? Half of my inner psyche is aiming to be blacklisted now. I've got this romantic notion of getting called up before some committee in the right-wing backlash of 1989.

Sounds like you've still got a healthy dose of moral fervor.
I just think it'll be nicer on your deathbed to think that you gave equity to a number of people. Do you know, it's quite possible that the noblest thing I ever did in my life was to make people laugh. I'll tell you . . . when a great dramatic actor dies, people mourn. When a comic dies, people grieve.

THE NEXT DAY, WHILE Dreyfuss taped 'The Phil Donahue Show,' I moved around the crowd and collected comments from the audience. Most were positive, "He looks so thin and great," etc. But one woman, arguing with a friend, kept saying, "I don't know, I just think he thinks he's better than us here in Minneapolis."

On the plane back to New York, I told Dreyfuss about the comment. For the first time in all the instances of reading him back quotes, I sensed the fragile hold Dreyfuss has on it all.

"Really," he implored. "I'm surprised, always surprised at the way people react to me. Like that applause today. I loved it. I really did. But I'll tell you something else. The fact that that lady said that . . . really bothers me." He looked at me accusingly.

An hour earlier, Dreyfuss had been rapturously walking the stage of the prestigious Guthrie Theater. He was given a quick VIP tour of the playhouse on his way out of Minneapolis and mentally caressed the empty stage. "This," he said at one point, "is better than sex."

I sat in on a quick meeting between Dreyfuss and Alvin Epstein, the artistic director of the Guthrie. Dreyfuss immediately asked if there were any openings.

"You know," said the director,"that we have the English repertoire system here, so it's a matter of a commitment of several months."

"I'm prepared . . . about two years from now . . . to jump in all the way," said Dreyfuss. "I have a film to do in July. . . ."

"Well," asked Epstein, "what would you like to play?"

Dreyfuss stood up, as he does when latching on to a passionate thought. "Albert Einstein. . . but not as an old man. He was only twenty-six when he discovered the theory of relativity! I want to play him when he was young! You know, a young physicist on the make. . . ."

The next day Dreyfuss was off again, this time to London to look at a play and check out a possible role. Returning three days later, we met at the New York ROLLING STONE offices, where Dreyfuss went around introducing himself as Al Pacino. When I asked him for a final comment, he stood up and pointed his finger. . . .

You know what no one ever talks about? Acting.

What do you mean? We talked about other actors, your method. . . .
We talked about part of my approach to the work. Acting is a big subject. Acting. What it is, how it's seen, what a particular actor personifies. There's an enormous country out there about acting that no one ever, ever talks about. Acting is the one art form that doesn't have a body of criticism behind it. You look at a piece of music by Beethoven, you could find a shelf of analysis and criticism in the library. Acting is an art form that's capable of holding up the same body of criticism. No one has ever written about it, about the specific art of Marlon Brando versus Spencer Tracy. 

Do you think it's because of the public image of the actor? 
Yes. Actors scare people. They are lunatics and children. And they are gods, because they are personifying existence. Everyone has this schizoid attitude toward actors. They'll either elect them governor of California or they won't let them into the tavern.

Marlon Brando claims that everyone acts all the time. 
Yes, of course, everyone talks and lies all the time. That's not acting. Acting takes structure. I don't care if he puts it down. I don't care if he has the mind of a tortoise. It doesn't matter. The man is the greatest actor on earth. When you really watch what that man does. When you watch his performance in Julius Caesar and see his anger . . . and then you see the same middle-class anger in The Ugly American, you begin to see the specificity of detail in his work. In Julius Caesar, he's the only one who knew how to wear the goddamn toga. People laughed at him, but it's such a work of immaculate detail. It's scary. [He springs up and begins to act out the part of Fletcher Christian as portrayed by Brando in 'Mutiny on the Bounty.'] And they called him faggoty for that performance! It was one of the most remarkable acting jobs ever and he got spit on for it.

You aren't nearly as objective about your own work as you are in jumping to Brando's defense. Look at your role in 'Duddy Kravitz.'
I know when I'm good and I know when I'm bad. I don't give a shit when you say I'm not being objective. Duddy Kravitz is not good. I don't care what people say. I don't care that Stephen Farber said I wasn't good in The Goodbye Girl. He was wrong. He's dead fucking wrong. I'm real good in The Goodbye Girl. I'm not real good in Duddy Kravitz. Here I am. What happens is I get called arrogant because I say I'm good in The Goodbye Girl [plops back into his chair, exhausted from the outburst]. You got me going. 

I'm seeing a screening of 'Duddy Kravitz' today at 2:30.
[Lurches forward] No shit? I'm coming.

THE LAST TIME DREYFUSS had seen the film in a theater had been the Canadian premiere, one of the last such events he ever attended. At the film's end, he was crying. When the last person left the theater, he was still crying and rejecting the consolations of the three friends who had come with him.

Within the first five minutes of watching himself again, Dreyfuss was churning with nervous energy. He draped himself over the chair in front of him, snapping his fingers in and out of a fist. When the film was over and the lights had come up in the Paramount screening room, Dreyfuss picked up his coat and began to head for the door in silence. . . . 

How do you feel? 
The same way I did when I saw it four years ago. I was crying in the balcony I was so upset. Friends are telling me, "You're great, you're fantastic." I knew. I still know. [Puts his coat back on] FUCK! I see that movie and I can see it's all here [circles mouth]. Not here [points to stomach]. It's not organic, I can see me trying. It bothers me that it's still there to be done well. I would do this role tomorrow if I had the chance to do it again. [Long silence] FUCK!

You take yourself very seriously.
People don't want actors expressing themselves in a way that says they are not simply an emotional tool. That's my other problem. Yes, I take myself seriously. Yes, I know what I can do best and I will do it yet. I don't need people telling me I'm great and I don't care if they say I'm not objective . . . you know, you'd be surprised how many people tell me I'm too intelligent to be an actor. Well, I'm so intelligent . . . I LOVE BEING AN ACTOR.

The Sign — "Crazy Neil" — has hung outside Neil Young's dressing room for several tours now. Down the hall it's young horse. Almost ten years after "Cinnamon Girl," Neil Young and Crazy Horse are back on the road with a show like no other in rock & roll.

Young has always denounced the impersonal feel of big halls, so as a partial solution he's changed the scale for this tour. The set is a huge bandstand complete with oversized amps, man-sized glass of water, four-foot harmonica and a towering "microphone" — all erected in front of the audience by scurrying, hooded figures with gleaming red eyes.

The houselights dim and we hear Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock version of "Star Spangled Banner" over the sound system, then the Beatles' "A Day in the Life." Suddenly Neil Young bolts up from atop one of the massive amps where he has been "sleeping." Picking up a guitar and singing by way of a wireless mike, he wanders childlike around the surreal bandstand playing acoustic songs spanning his entire career, from "I Am a Child" to "Comes a Time." He crawls back into a sleeping bag and the "road-eyes," as he calls them, prepare for an electric set with Crazy Horse.

While the equipment is being set up, the sound system booms announcements from the stage at Woodstock (remember "There's some brown acid out there that is not specifically . . . too good"). The fully scripted show has the unmistakable feel of a dreamlike retrospective of Young's last twelve years.

I catch up with the always elusive Young in the lobby of his New York hotel:

"Neil," I say, "for the first time you seem to be tying together onstage all the directions of your career into a kind of futuristic/nostalgic statement."

"Can't find a newspaper in this town," he says.

"Music is changing and, in fact, you appear to be changing with it."

"Too bad about the pope, isn't it?"

I try again backstage at Madison Square Garden, just after his second sold-out performance:

"Neil," I venture, "this show would surprise anybody expecting the old laid-back image."

"The songs all fit a certain mood. Frank, Billy and Ralphy [Crazy Horse] are playing really great."

The next night at Nassau Coliseum: "Neil, the playing of stage announcements from Woodstock . . ."

"I have an idea for the show," he says. "It's a parody of when I used to wait for everyone to be quiet before playing. Well, just as the show is about to start, this popcorn vendor is making all this noise toward the front of the stage: 'Hey, get your popcorn.' The stage announcer comes out and says that Neil Young won't come out until everyone is quiet and that vendor leaves. But the vendor doesn't leave, he makes more noise. The kids start getting pissed off, then the vendor jumps onstage." Young laughs. "I am the vendor."

"Incredible," I say. "But the concept of this show and the road eyes . . . ?"

"Want some participatory journalism? You're going to work tonight. Larry, Jeannie . . . fix him up."

My transformation into road-eye takes several minutes. Young enthusiastically explains the duties: as a road-eye I can do anything as long as I crouch and move with "urgent fervor." For the second half of the set I am to change into an elderly professor, the free-roaming assistant to Doctor Deaf (coproducer David Briggs). This way, I can take notes in character.

Wandering around onstage during a performance is an education. You hear deafening, echoing applause, but it's impossible to see the audience, save for the first seven rows. Those rows are all too clear. You can see the guy and his date trying to light a roach, acid casualties fluttering their hands, guards goosing young girls who've rushed the stage and mesmerized faces wondering exactly what Neil is up to this time. Young, grinning as if he's finally at home onstage with his assortment of road-eyes, doctors and professors swirling around, has never played with so much passion.

The month-long tour will be captured in Young's upcoming movie, Human Highway — which is a good thing because it shouldn't go unrecorded. In the warm words of a fellow road-eye, as we were erecting the giant microphone in front of 16,000 screaming fans, "He's the only guy I would wear this goddamn hood for . . . he's the only guy that would ask."

t began when an FM station accidentally played the Atlanta Rhythm Section album cut "Imaginary Lover" at the wrong speed – 45. Favorable calls began to light up the switchboard, so the disc jockey let it play. Speeded up, the song sounded unmistakably like Fleetwood Mac, with Stevie Nicks warbling lead vocals.

News quickly reached Nicks in Los Angeles. She rushed out to buy the record and played it at the wrong speed. "I got chills," says Stevie. "It sounds exactly like something I'd sing, the way I'd sing it. I even played it for Christine [McVie], mixed in with some other demos for the new album. She complimented me on it."

With the aforementioned Fleetwood Mac LP still months away from release, Nicks has been keeping anything but a low profile. She spent a week in New York perfecting her duet with Kenny Loggins, "Whenever I Call You 'Friend,'" for his new album. She has also been writing a batch of new songs, many of them for a proposed film fantasy of "Rhiannon" that she is developing with publicist Danny Goldberg.

All this activity, says Nicks, is a result of an "emotional bummer" she had wanted to throw herself out of. The reason? She lost an antique black velvet jacket – the good-luck piece she has worn onstage (during "Landslide") every night with Fleetwood Mac – at a Warren Zevon performance at the Roxy in Los Angeles. Nicks has all but given up on it being returned. Facing the upcoming summer Fleetwood Mac tour without the jacket, she says, "It's irreplaceable and means a whole lot more to me than to whomever took it." 

here had been varying reports from his Australian and Japanese tours earlier this year, but when Bob Dylan hit town June 1st for a week of shows at the Universal Amphitheatre here (2500 seats), he brought with him a radically different show and a whole new wave of controversy.

Dylan's first American concerts since his much-acclaimed Rolling Thunder appearances in 1976 were glibly professional. Working with a tight and precise twelve-piece band (including three singers) and performing no solo acoustic numbers, Dylan left most die-hard fans and reviewers puzzled on opening night. "There were things that killed me, and there were things that really pissed me off," said one prominent musician. "He could take this show to Vegas and not change one note."

To be sure, Dylan was relaxed and gregarious onstage. The two-hour show opened with an instrumental version of "Hard Rain." Wearing specially tailored clothes (alternately, a black studded pants outfit or one with a white sequined thunderbolt design), Dylan strode out for the blues song "Love Her with a Feeling." After a new song, "Baby Stop Crying," the show headed into a generous cross section of Dylan's most famous work from every period except Nashville Skyline. Most of the new arrangements bore little similarity to the original versions. "Shelter from the Storm" was performed as a kind of rockabilly march, "Masters of War" as a Bo Diddley rocker, "Love Minus Zero/No Limit" a calypso groove, "I Shall Be Released" a jaunty melody and "Tangled Up in Blue" as a blue spotlit, majestic show stopper. On "Ballad of a Thin Man," Dylan removed the microphone from its stand and strolled out to shake hands with the audience.

Said one Dylan associate: "He's discovered the show value of his music. He's also rediscovered a lot of the old songs . . . he can pick and choose to match his any particular emotion."

Dylan, who has been referring to himself as an "entertainer" lately, also surprised audiences with earnest between-song patter, like: "Here's a song from my new album, Street Legal, on Columbia Records and Tapes! . . . Like to say hello to Richard Manuel and Raquel Welch out there tonight . . . Here's a hit song from my hit movie Renaldo and Clara! . . . Here's a song I recorded many years ago with the Band! . . . As Jerry Garcia says, 'I must be checking on down the line.'"

It is said that ever since traveling to see Neil Diamond in Las Vegas last year, Dylan has been concerned with updating his concert stance. He was impressed enough to sign with Diamond's manager, Jerry Weintraub, several weeks later.

"I'm ready to have a regular band," Dylan announced in an interview late last year. "I want to be able to tour and record again with a group of musicians I know I work well with."

Dylan has been very active since auditioning and putting the group together last Christmas. By performing this isolated week of Los Angeles concerts, Dylan had hoped to create a groundswell of support that would carry him through his current European tour and the release of Street Legal to his return to the United States, possibly for a tour this fall.

By the end of his Amphitheatre run, Dylan had won over many doubters. There were the usual spate of celebrities from music and film, of course, but Dylan had wanted to meet only one — Elvis Costello. Costello, who came back twice, was mightily impressed when he met and spoke with Dylan. And Dylan reported: "Hey, he's a pretty normal guy!"

HE CAME WOBBLING straight toward me, aiming himself somewhere in the direction of the stage. I was fifteen, had obtained my first backstage pass as a representative from the local underground paper ... and I knew this was my shot.

I introduced myself to an amiably blitzed Kris Kristofferson and, for the length of my interview pitch, the singer/songwriter/actor sincerely tried to focus on exactly who was talking to him. Nodding vaguely — perhaps consenting, perhaps searching — he lurched onstage at the San Diego Civic Theatre, working through a full bottle of tequila during his two-hour set with Rita Coolidge. A man having that much trouble remembering his own lyrics wouldn't soon be remembering an interview for the San Diego Door.

Kristofferson, in fact, didn't even nod later as he walked past me outside the dressing-room door. He simply hooked my arm and pulled me along with him. Heading for a cantina on the other side of town, Kristofferson was to meet the family and friends of his new wife. We would somehow do the promised interview there.

We arrived at the bar/restaurant and Kris strolled inside. They stopped me — I looked my age. Kristofferson put up a polite argument for a moment, then grumbled to himself and disappeared inside the bar. I headed for the door.

"Where you goin', hoss?" Kristofferson had emerged with a drink. "Come back here." He settled into a gauche red leatherette chair next to the cash register and, as I fumbled with my tape recorder, began relating anecdotes from the set of the movie he'd just shot with Bob Dylan and Sam Peckinpah—Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Those tales from the secrecy-laden set in Durango, Mexico, were enough to entice a certain youth-culture tabloid into publishing me for the first time.

FIVE YEARS LATER I am sitting in the Albuquerque Hilton, headquarters for Convoy, another Peckinpah film, based on the C.W. McCall single and starring Kris Kristofferson and Ali MacGraw. I have since become a contributing editor of that same tabloid. I call set publicists who are "pleased to hear from me." Film executives take my calls. Yet no one has approached Kristofferson about doing an interviewthe set has, in fact, been closed to journalists. "It's a little tense—you didn't know?" a film spokesman asked.

I write a note to the actor, whom I haven't spoken with in years, stuff it in his already crammed message box and proceed to spend an evening doing what Albuquerqueans seem to do on Thursday nights: Dick Van Dyke is always great to see. Lou Grant is interesting. A local anchor man has the manic look of a mass murderer. ... Still no phone call from Kris. I wander down to the newsstand, past hundreds of shoe salesmen conventioneers, and pick up a stack of fan magazines which bugle Kristofferson's name on their covers. They all tell the same story: Rhodes scholar turns country singer turns bankable movie star ... fabulous.

As Mike Wallace sits down to tell Johnny Carson about his low regard for "overwritten" personalities, I can't help but wonder what kind of walls Kristofferson might have built since his openness at the San Diego cantina. These very thoughts are interrupted by the phone.

"Jesus fuck," barks Kris Kristofferson. "Hope I didn't wake you up. This is it, you know. This one's just about done me in, this fucking one. This fucking thing is ... crazy. I'm just a basket case ... all my circuits ..." He pauses. "How ya been? What're you doing here?"

I tell him. "Okay," says Kristofferson. "I'm leaving on the first plane out in the morning, going to New York for some concerts. Let's fly together. I'll call you in the morning."

The next morning in the lobby, Kristofferson comes flashing around the corner, moving swiftly and looking gaunt and bedraggled in a black shirt, frayed brown cords and boots. His pale blue eyes, fixed on the floor in front of him, are visible from across the room. Several women do a double take, but he is already gone, having first hooked me by the arm again. We talk on the way to the airport.

"I've done five days' work in two days, and more than that in one, "he says. "Now it's their turn to finish the movie. Everybody's going crazy, right down to the still photographer. I gotta get out of here."

Once on the plane, all he wants is some sleep, and the shades do not help. The seat left empty next to him is promptly filled by a chatty head stewardess. Kristofferson is met at La Guardia by manager Bert Block, a graying music-business veteran with a black cap and a caseful of offers. But Kris just wants to get straight to the New York Hilton to rejoin his wife, Rita Coolidge Kristofferson.

By the time the limo door has opened, Kristofferson had already tipped the driver handsomely, signed a scrap of paper for the man's wife and grabbed the luggage. "See you tomorrow," he tells me, friendly but tense. "I'll call you." He disappears into a mass of tour groups. The reason for the swiftness is soon obvious — a clutch of three female admirers lying in wait almost catch him.

I cannot resist walking up and asking — why is this man so desirable?

"It's his shoulders," says one. "The way they taper."

"He's so gentle looking," says another. "I loved him in Sailor Who Fell from Grace." She giggles. "He seems like he'd just take forever."

"Great ass," chirps the third.

They all agree on this point.

ANOTHER MAN MIGHT return the affections of at least a small fraction of the many ladies who quite literally fling themselves upon Kris Kristofferson in a given day. But at forty-one, Kristofferson is by all indications a faithful husband. When my phone rings the next day, it's an infinitely more relaxed and urbane man who says he'll meet me downstairs for rehearsal.


His hair is combed neatly, his cheeks rosy and a chipper smile is plastered across Kristofferson's face. His one-day switch from Convoy to Radio City Music Hall will be spent practicing — something he doesn't mind at all. He arrives expectantly at the storefront rehearsal room on the outskirts of Manhattan, striding into the room full of musicians (all longtime friends whom Kris has tried to keep with him in all his TV and movie appearances). He yelps like a kid just back from summer camp. "This is such an upper after that movie shit," Kristofferson beams appreciatively.

Kristofferson throws on a guitar and, shirt open, begins slashing through the set. The band — Donnie Fritts on piano, Steve Bruton, Jerry McGee and Billy Swan on guitars, Mike Utley on organ, Terry Paul on bass and Sammy Creason on drums — falls into place. More than to rehearse, they need to play.

It is all too easy to forget, with Kristofferson's face in movie ads everywhere, the impact of his songwriting catalogsongs like "Lovin' Her Was Easier," "Help Me Make It through the Night," "For the Good Times," "Bobby McGee," "Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down" and "The Pilgrim." But Kristofferson doesn't mind that he will never be wrapped in the same mystique as his favorite artist, Bob Dylan.

After three tough hours of rehearsal with the band, Kristofferson falls into a chair and proudly watches Rita take over.

"We are not," he points out, "the Steve and Eydie of our generation."

The Radio City shows are typical of Kristofferson's professional, music-oriented new stage demeanor. Not prone to stage patter, he is also no longer haplessly drunk. After Billy Swan opens impressively with a few solo numbers, Kris strides onstage to an explosion of flashcubes and presents an hour-long set of his best-known songs. Rita is next, torching her way through a selection of material from her own albums. The last half-hour of the show is reserved for their swooning duets. The band shifts tempos effortlessly and it is a crowd-pleasing, full evening.

Afterward, Kris and Rita are swiftly transported back to their unspectacular hotel room. They apologize to their guest for having to stay in the room (they are still bashful about security precautions). Kris appreciates, he says, being able to wind down from a show by talking. He sits earnestly on the edge of his bed, turns on the tape recorder himself, and begins the conversation as if it's his job to be entertaining. Rita disappears into an adjoining room.

Kristofferson rakes his hand through his hair and offers me the topic of Network, which he'd just seen on the in-hotel movie service. Not particularly impressed with its consistency, the actor prefers instead another Sidney Lumet work, Dog Day Afternoon. Kristofferson is instantly off reeling perfect word-for-word Pacino dialogue.

Then Kris' three-year-old girl, Casey, who seems quite at home on the road, hurls herself at Kristofferson.

"Know what I did?" the child asks seductively.

"What did you do?" Kristofferson asks.

"I left the water on in the bathroom."

"Don't tell anybody from New York," Father advises.

"Did it flood anything?"

"No," the child answers conspiratorially.

"Then it's okay." They shake hands and Casey tears joyously into the next room, leaving Kris a grinnin' fool. They can't possibly be staging this — things simply have never been better for the Kristofferson family. Not long ago, Kris and Rita were still in the midst of a moody career lull—album sales were slipping, interest was low. Then Kristofferson landed the role of John Norman Howard, the fallen rock star, opposite Barbra Streisand's Esther Hoffman in A Star Is Born. The much-publicized part, Kristofferson says, had previously belonged to Elvis Presley and Mick Jagger.

"I wasn't real hot to do the movie," recalls Kristofferson. (The fact that he once dated Streisand did not help matters with her producer/boyfriend Jon Peters.) "God knows I'm glad I did, though." Many tales of on-set anguish later, the film has proved a huge international film and soundtrack success.

Then, a bigger surprise — Rita Coolidge, all but taken for granted after five solo albums, scored three hit singles ("Higher and Higher," "We're All Alone" and "The Way You Do the Things You Do") from her now platinum Anytime ... Anywhere album. She is suddenly one of the biggest female singers this side of Linda Ronstadt. And Kristofferson, seen currently in Semi-Tough and soon in Convoy, is one of the screen's leading matinee idols.

Kristofferson bolts upward—full of nervous energy—throws ice cubes into a pot of cold coffee, and begins to talk without my prompting. "As far as the ... charisma and all that goes ..." He sighs heavily. "You got to realize it's bullshit. Take it for what it's fucking worth—yesterday's papers. People say, 'Now that you're a sex symbol, do you feel that people are taking your lyrics less seriously.' They weren't listening to them at all before. You know."

"What's so fucking wrong with being a sex symbol?" Kristofferson asks. "They have this annual list called the Boy Watchers, the top ten most watchables ... I won it. Number one. It's never come out anywhere because I don't got no press agent—you read about OJ, but I was number one, man. If I, at San Mateo High School, had been told that the Boy Watchers were gonna rate me, because of my eyes and my body, above ... everybody else." He wags his head. "I'd a said, 'Hoss, you been sniffing that glue.'"

Kris has built his acting reputation on more than his rumpled good looks. Working under a variety of directors (Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, Paul Mazursky, Frank Pierson, Dennis Hopper) and among accomplished actors (Harvey Keitel, Karen Black, Ellen Burstyn, Jill Clayburgh and Burt Reynolds), he has honed his own style diligently. I ask him if he has learned to accept the compliments.


Kristofferson lights up, takes a long pull of some "laughing tobacco," which he has generously substituted for alcohol, and chuckles. "In the state of mind I'm in, yes ... I feel confident from Star Is Born. I felt confident before, but I was also fearful of the unpredictability of it all. I take it more seriously than I used to. Like there were times when I would blank out. Once with Mazursky I had to do a scene nine times. Once with Scorsese, I had to do it thirty-five times. That was a horror show. 'Specially when you've got actors working opposite you who are coming to tears every time. It was the last scene of Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, when I had this big Forties-movie type of public fight with Ellen Burstyn. Very difficult for me. We shot a master scene that was dynamite. Then we started moving in for the close-up and Marty asked me, "Give it a little more." This is a thing, since my first movie, that has had a Pavlovian effect on me. When you say, 'Give me a little more,' I immediately can't do it. It's gonna get phony because it always does. I used to have such definite attitudes about what I thought was right. I learned to be more open, damnit, working with Sam on this last film."

Kristofferson had actually finished Convoy once, only to return for ten days of additional shooting before we'd left Albuquerque two days ago. "Sam," Kris says, "got jazzed with the possibilities — and God bless him, he got going in a surreal direction. He would have reshot the entire movie if he had the time — it could have been a cross between Vigilante Force and El Topo. Nobody knew what was happening ... I ended up staying in the trailer a lot."

Rita enters the room now, dressed casually, with her ebony hair pulled back. Her voice has a Southern smokiness to it. "Connie and Willie Nelson saw the Donny and Marie show," she tells Kris, "and they said the duet was absolutely great." (Kris and Marie had sung "You'll Never Find Another Love like Me.")

"I had my doubts," says Kristofferson. He looks enormously relieved now. "That's neat. If the Nelsons liked it, that means I'll like it.

Viewing this portrait of domestic bliss, I wonder if Kristofferson misses the romantic discontent that may have once led him to write his greatest songs. Kristofferson lets me finish completely, then summons a debater's zeal in arguing. "You've got to say, first, 'What is happiness?' You know? I would say that the statement that I've written my best stuff out of pain is patently false, as far as I'm concerned. I have often written songs under the actual feeling of pain. Seldom have they been a success. Usually ... it's passion recalled during a period of tranquility. To me, the greatest upper is writing ... and when I'm feeling good is when I do it the best.

It's interesting that Kristofferson's entire wardrobe consists of clothes he's kept from the films he's worked on: a vest from Blume in Love, boots from A Star Is Born, the jacket from The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea, all pieces of his life he still keeps close at hand. Just as Kristofferson has gone through many incarnations in life — as an aspiring boxer, a college footballer, a novelist, an army officer, an Oxford scholarship student—he also carries physical souvenirs: a bad knee, an unsold novel, a boxer's droop over his left eye, an Oxford vocabulary and an officer's bark.

He was on the verge of accepting a job teaching English at West Point when Kristofferson took off for Nashville in 1965. "It was the last of the roarin' times," he says, "and I'm proud to say I was there." It wasn't quite so easy. Kris was married to his high-school sweetheart, Fran Beer, when he moved into his first Nashville tenement. He started in the town's "mail room," the all-night janitor job at CBS Studios — emptying ashtrays for everybody from Loretta Lynn to Bob Dylan, pitching songs on the side. After seven years of marriage, Kristofferson separated from his wife in '67 and flung himself full tilt into the Nashville community, writing songs like "Sunday Mornin'" and "Bobby McGee."

In 1970, with the support of his idol Johnny Cash, Kris released his now classic first album, a collection of mostly demos called Kristofferson. The Los Angeles Times' Robert Hilburn immediately championed him; many other critics followed suit. ("You get all into reading those reviews and everything. It runs your head around," Kristofferson says.) He assembled a ragtag collection of musicians like Billy Swan on guitar, Norman Blake on drums and former Lovin' Spoonful guitarist Zal Yanovsky. They drunkenly toured, Kris says, most of the dives this country has to offer. "I still kept getting good reviews. I felt the whole world was on my side."

Kristofferson proceeded westward to his notorious Los Angeles debut at the Troubadour. This was, he recalls, the Big Week. "On Sunday night the heavies came to see us. We'd been up at Dennis Hopper's agent's place getting drunk and I had dropped the rest of the band off someplace to the east. I went into the Hughes Supermarket to buy some Bull Durhams and then fell asleep in the parking lot. When I woke up, they had called the morgue. Missed my whole first show."

But Kristofferson was a hit in L.A. anyway — more glowing reviews, script offers and parties. Columnists calling him the "country Warren Beatty" linked him with nearly every female in town. The critical honeymoon lasted all the way through a successful second album, The Silver-Tongued Devil and I.

Kristofferson's third album, Border Lord, released in '72, was soundly panned, perhaps most flamboyantly in Rolling Stone. "I really felt it turn, man. And it pissed me off so bad. I guess I must have tied that in with the poor sales of the album. God knows, that wasn't the reason." He snickers. "But when you're on the road you don't have much time to think up a whole lot of reasons. Besides, unfair reviews in Rolling Stone are like Ring Magazine knocking boxing." Kristofferson stops himself. "God, I sound just like Richard Nixon."


Things changed drastically over the next year. No longer the darling of the critics, Kristofferson nearly tracked down a writer in Seattle for reviewing Leon Russell, Rita Coolidge and Kris Kristofferson albums together. "Just 'cause she was Leon's old lady before mine. He made her sound like a fucking groupie and I didn't even know Leon at the time. Christ knows he doesn't need to be saddled with my country shit. I never came closer to actually going after a guy. I was really crazy."

Kris and Rita meanwhile had taken to touring and recording together, and later both accepted an invitation to act in Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Rita had a small nonspeaking role; Kristofferson played the Kid. He called Dylan, a friend, and coaxed him into joining the filming in Durango, a coup of no mean proportions.

"There was times," Kristofferson apologizes, "when I figured out the best way to behave around that sucker, until I found that the only way I could was to just abandon all that shit. At times I couldn't make no communication with him, you know. Looking back on it, I think it's my fault ... I really admire the sucker, but I could not understand him.

"But he had a hell of a hard time down there, man. I admire him for sticking it out ... I saw that dippy TV version of the movie and realized it could have been dynamite. His score was brilliant—and I never knew it. "What's Dylan's stuff like these days?" Kris asks. "I haven't listened as much as I should ..."

Well, it wasn't new, but later I played Kristofferson a tape of Blood on the Tracks. He sat listening silently, transported somewhere, and afterward chuckled. "I can see for Sara, it must have been difficult at times being the 'Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.' Can you imagine being married to the little fucker? He says, 'Where's my hat?' She says, 'Hat? There's 150 hats over there. Whaddya mean, hat?'"

Kristofferson, after Pat Garrett, accepted more movie roles — Blume in Love, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea and Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. He recorded solo albums throughout, like Spooky Lady's Sideshow and Who's to Bless and Who's to Blame, that sold only marginally. "I still like them damn albums," he says. The touring continued, and as Kristofferson's drinking intensified, he began to develop a strange feeling of inferiority. "I would stalk around the dressing room downing Jack Daniel's just like I was gonna walk out on the stage and get hit with a big wave. It was hard for me to remember they paid to get in there."

I ask Kristofferson if he ever acted while drunk.

"Who knows? I drank all the time. I covered pretty well because I had a long time to learn how. I thought my acting, at the time, was right. Maybe I was good; I don't know."

His face, usually sunny, crumbles into a leer. "I was really pissed off at something I had read which had been put out by the movie company. It said I wouldn't do any publicity for the movie [Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea] because I wouldn't do anything that I didn't get paid for. Well, I did something for them that I didn't get paid for." He spits the words. "That fucking Playboy thing."

Kristofferson had finally plied himself one night with enough alcohol to pose with Sarah Miles for the Playboy spread that has kept fan sheets buzzing since.

Not long afterward, when his doctor warned him his liver was in peril, Kristofferson quit a twenty-year drinking habit. "On a basic level, there's so much less pain now. You know? We know we can do it. I thought we would. Now I know we can. So why get panicky? Now I just have to loosen myself up onstage where I can be creative. I haven't got my feet under me enough yet.

But Kristofferson is learning everybody loves a winner. His crackerjack band is suited to all styles of music — rockabilly, country, pop, jazz — and they run the gamut every performance. He has never sung betterand Rita has reacted to fame with such poise and style that it's amazing widespread success took her this long. When husband and wife join for the last half-hour of the show, however, it is their set's most natural moment. The audience is always most enthusiastic, too, when it's down to Kris and Rita sharing one mike and staring into each other's eyes.

"The traditional idea is you've got to make love to the audience, you know," Kristofferson says. He's just the slightest bit shy about discussing the notion. "We're usually written up as 'an almost pornographic stage show' with a wink and nudge. We're just standing up there singing. God knows, if you want us to get into writhing seductively, fondling, we can give it a shot." He leans forward. "I meant to reach out and pat her on her back tonight and I hit her right on her tit! Right in front of everybody. She says to me, 'You asshole, you just patted me right on the tit.'"

"No I didn't," comes the voice of authority from the next room, and Kris is rattled. "I said, 'On my tit!'" Rita says. "That's pretty good because it's not that easy to pat."

Kris shrugs and spills iced coffee on himself. "Now I feel like a real dodo," says the man his band members call "The Return of the Pink Poet."

They laugh warmly and Rita calmly sits beside her husband to give him a kiss on the cheek. "We were just talking," Kris says, "about the fact that you gotta be attractive to your audience. Playin' to somebody else is something new."


"It's all fantasy anyway," Rita figures. "The chicks are out there looking at Kris and going 'GaaaaaaaaaaaaI'd like to be up front there with him.' Guys, I would hope, are doing the same on my end. And then they come together and all of a sudden the fantasies become realities ... and people just love it." Rita continues talking along these lines, but Kris is back at the last statement.

"Now that you put your mouth on it ... we'll probably never be natural again."

They laugh again, more warmly this time, and Rita swings her legs across Kris' lap. He is, indeed, the warm and almost clumsy romantic that his female fans sense from the screen. Casey is asleep, the phone has stopped ringing, and it's four o'clock in the morning. They begin necking.

I take my cue.

"Meet you here after the show tomorrow," Kris instructs as I'm slipping out. "Let's talk some more."

The Saturday evening performance is even finer than the previous night. Wearing a gorgeous, gasp-inducing turquoise gown, Rita continually proves herself just as popular with the women in the audience as with the men. Her understated strength, the whispered "thank yous"s and her spectacular vocals amount to a coolly powerful mystique' easily rivaling that of her good friend Cher Allman.

In the words of a faceless Kristofferson fanatic behind me, "Whatever she's got, she's sure not worried about losing it."

They met on a plane in 1971. Kristofferson, on his way to Nashville to be interviewed for a cover article in Look magazine, sat next to her for the flight. Rita was getting off in Memphis to rehearse with a new band, the Dixie Flyers. Kris got off in Memphis, too. Look folded anyway. They were married two years later.

Coolidge, now thirty-two, is at career peak, but still is full-time mother and wife. "Before I met Kris," she says, "my career was the most important thing in my life because it was the only thing I had to hold on to. I really wanted my life to be together — it is now. My child is more important to me than my career, but she would never make demands to stop my music. Casey's always ready to go on the road."

Still legendary as one of L.A.'s premier background vocalists, Coolidge made her first mark as a soloist in Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen. Signed to A&M Records, she recorded five albums before Anytime ... Anywhere broke through. (Still in the can is an entire album of jazz singing done with pianist Barbara Carroll.) None of these albums was enough to break her out of a dedicated cult audience.

"I think I peaked on frustration with the last album [It's Only Love]," Rita admits. "It came out and was the biggest secret of my life. I just thought it deserved more." She vowed to work even harder on the next album, and she did. Anytime  Anywhere was assembled from seventeen recorded tracks, all arranged and executed without the help of Kristofferson. "It was great to bring home," remembers Rita. "It was like, 'Look what I did!'"

A&M Records President Jerry Moss added several monumental singles suggestions in addition to those already cut. He also played her Boz Scaggs' "We're All Alone" for the first time. Rita reentered the studio to cut five more tunes, one of them "Higher and Higher," using an arrangement from brother-in-law Booker T. Jones. The single proved one of last year's biggest worldwide hits. And its followup, "We're All Alone," might yet surpass it.

Rita Coolidge views all this success with a kind of wry relief. "Boy, I wanted a single," she says. "Just for the security to keep recording. All I want to do is make records. And it would kill me if I couldn't. It's my very life."

Rita operates mostly out of her home in the Malibu hills overlooking the Pacific. "The last six years have filled my brain with backstages and crowds," she says good-naturedly. "I haven't found a real good reason to go out on my own yet. Especially now. In the past I think Kris' fans and mine have objected to the pairing. That's changed now. It's all very positive energy  I think I'm a good mirror image of him and he looks as beautiful as I ever could."

She enjoys discussing Kris, particularly in his sobriety. "It is just the self-confidence and a pride in his work he's never had before. He used to embarrass himself a lot and to cover up the embarrassment, he'd have a couple more drinks. He has so much more confidence now.

"I think having Casey made him aware of how his other children were looking at him too. He felt embarrassed a few times last summer when we were on the road and Tracy [fifteen] was with him. Tracy was proud of him; she's stuck up for him since she was two years old. Kris [nine] was the same — he could never see anything wrong with his dad."

But Rita is a changed person too. No longer given to black and turquoise, she has acquired a flair for color and boisterousness. How does she look back on the Rita Coolidge of seven years ago? "The person that did that first album is so far away ... it's not easy for me to be objective. She was a combination of Bonnie Bramlett and a searching Rita Coolidge."

And now?

"I'm going for a little more class," she laughs. "You know, like Natalie Cole. It really comes across if you don't care. If I ever did any image building, it was this week."

"Fortunately we both got hot at the same time," says Kris Kristofferson. He chuckles to himself. Moments before, photographer Ron Galella had blitz-clicked both Kris and Rita in the elevator. Now, with the soundless glow of Saturday Night Live across the room, we assume the same positions as the previous night. "I happen to feel a lot more secure than I thought I would feel about her having a hit. I'm not gonna get slapped with the accusation, ten years from now, that I held her career back. Usually success allows people to be better. You can't think of many people that it really fucks up."


What about all the A Star Is Born rumors? Weren't those all successful people? Why couldn't they get along? Kristofferson grins weakly — the obligatory question. Yes, he had skimmed the Playboy interview with Streisand where she took credit for "pushing him."

"She didn't push me to act any way," Kris asserts. "Maybe she says that ... maybe that's what she was doing when we did have arguments. I didn't need that. But what she did demand was ..." He scratches impatiently at his closely cropped beard. "She would try five different ways to do everything. That's a degree of professionalism that I'm not used to working with. But to be honest, Barbra had a greater instinct on when something was right. She knew it was right even when Frank Pierson didn't even see it sometimes. I hate to get into all that.

"I have read that she cut me out of the picture. Well, I just don't believe that. The scene I'm proudest of is sitting there writing a song that I ain't really writing. I don't buy most of that shit I read.

"What people forget is ... fucking guy John Norman Howard was a loser. In every version he's been a loser. Well, I think this one bent over backward to make him acceptable. God knows I was fighting for that."

Though he wants to move past the experience, he is anxious to have something positive to remember. "She can piss you off," he offers. "Just like anybody can. Because she wants her way. I don't blame her for wanting it. If you can get it, goddamn ... get it. If I thought she was fucking with me I'd certainly tell her in a minute. Just as Jon Peters would, you know ... I did, you know. That was part of the problem."

I have to ask him about the line attributed to him during a near fistfight with Peters: "If I want any shit out of you, I'll squeeze your head."

"Got to be one of the best," beams Kristofferson. "A stroke. I was so surprised he didn't just punch my lights out, you know. It's the kind of thing you usually think of when you're driving home. But unfortunately, it was over a bunch of open mikes. But fuck it. As far as I'm concerned, they're friends of ours. In so many ways, the thing has helped me. So many people who hated her had to say something nice about the movie because people were going to it all over the place. So they're gonna say something nice about me. She was the fall guy. Next time I will be. I don't worry about it. Without a real good promotion, I think it could have died. But kids and word of mouth made it a great film."

Does Kristofferson think he's a great artist? "Right now," he says immediately, "the most valuable thing to me seems to be time, and with time, I can be great. I have beenand I will be. I could write a fucking science-fiction novel if I had time. If I hadn't been crazy with that movie, I'da been closer with the band this time. Lissen to me, I'm just as bad as Bobby DeNiro in The Taxi Driver.

"There's a lot left to do ... the important thing is working with people you admire. I crave to work with Bergman. People say that David Lean might reshoot Mutiny on the Bounty. I would like to play Fletcher Christian. But it probably won't happen. Nick Nolte or [Sylvester] Stallone would get it.

"I want to start doing more creative stuff with my band ..." Kris reaches over to turn up Jackson Browne singing "The Pretender" on Saturday Night Live. He watches and falls silent again, seeming almost wistful.

"As far as fame," he says, "the everlasting fame thing. I used to think that was important for a writerthe desire to make your mark. Your immortality. Fuck. Look at Shakespeare. That's only five hundred years, hoss. Five hundred compared to 4 million. And if you want to aim at Shakespeare, you gotta beat Bob Dylan first. And Joni Mitchell and a few others. So what you gotta do is your best and not worry about the other shit.

"If 'Bobby McGee' lasts, if Star Is Born lasts, if 'Help Me Make It through the Night' lasts, if all of 'em last, man ... who cares? I just need a good rest right now." But in the two weeks following Kris Kristofferson's departure from New York, he would write a slew of material, finish a new solo album in Los Angeles called Easter Island, a duet album with Rita. And would agree to a new film, Hanover Street, to be shot in England — Kris will play a World War II pilot, beardless, opposite Genevieve Bujold.

Neither of us know this as Kristofferson yells down the hallway of the New York Hilton after me. "Got a last question?"

"Can you — Kris Kristofferson — do it all?" I shout back.

I have a clear image of Kristofferson yelling back his answer through a mouthful of ice: "Look at me! I can go from Donny and Marie to Sam Peckinpah to Radio City Music Hall in one week. I'm just a ramblin' guy ... with rangy hips ...

"COURSE I CAN DO IT ALL!"


Their new album, held throughout the product-glutted summer for just the right moment, accidentally came out the same afternoon as the new Rolling Stones LP. Their first tour in three years was canceled. They haven't had a hit single since 1974's "Rikki Don't Lose That Number." And still, their sixth and most esoteric effort yet, Aja, is one of the season's hottest albums and by far Steely Dan's fastest-selling ever. Suddenly, against all the odds, it's Steely Dan fever.

They are the unlikeliest supergroup — perhaps because there is no group. Two blurry characters named Walter Becker and Donald Fagen write and construct the struct the songs, then hire highly skilled studio musicians to execute the parts. They even play themselves, but less and less, it seems, each album. ("It wouldn't bother me at all," says Becker, "not to play on my own album.") The infrequent product of their labors is labeled a Steely Dan album. Any further details are subject to Becker's and Fagen's notorious distaste for facts.

There are, though, plenty of stories making the rounds: about Becker and Fagen being "obsessively maniacal" Scrabble players whose marathon games have wasted weeks of valuable studio time. Or the one that suggests they wrote Aja about their fetish for shooting ducks locked in copulation. Or the former president of ABC Records who reportedly disowned them, calling them "worms."

They are said to delight in making mincemeat of outsiders, these two. There were questions to be asked, though. It was an ugly job, but somebody had to do it.

I arrived at the tiny Malibu guest home of Walter Becker the day Aja was released. It was late afternoon, morning for the bass-and-guitar-playing half of Steely Dan's composing team. I waited in a quaintly domesticated living room, amid harmless collections of beach shells and artifacts. I could hear Becker playing guitar, soloing lazily along with a jazz station in a back bedroom. He was just waking up.

A moment later, neighbor Donald Fagen pulled up in a black sports car. The lead vocalist/key boardist/composer breezed straight into the kitchen for a mug of coffee. Becker emerged with Fender in hand; wordlessly, the two took seats. There was something vaguely disconcerting about their Eddie Haskell smiles; they were quite aware of their heinous reputations.

"We do encourage that misconception," allowed Becker. "But it's not that accurate." He lit a Marlboro with shaky hands. "We're no longer belligerent to interviewers, for example…."

Fagen immediately dispensed with the diplomacy. "A lot of intervie wers are just jerk-offs," he snapped, taking a swipe at a fly.

The pair are like delinquents taking an oral exam in detention. Becker is long-haired and wispily bearded, in the spirit of Howard Hughes' latter years. He exudes a newtlike translucence. Fagen, by comparison more tanned, is wearing dark shades he will not remove. And his mouth is caricature-sized; it's as if he has an extra two inches of lip and no room for it. It's true — they could be characters from their own sinister songs.

They obviously sleep all day. I asked how they spend their nights. "Writing songs," Becker replied. "I go over to Donald's. He comes over here. We spend a lot of time doing that." He played a casual solo and thought. "Overdubbing, too."

"Most of our time is spent on the Working Process," Fagen began, slapping the arms of his leather chair. "We spent most of the year recording." Fagen stopped slapping. "But I don't know what we were actually doing."

"Overdubbing," answered Becker.

"We overdubbed a lot of the overdubs over." Becker grinned luxuriously, cracking open a can of Coke.

"Yeah, we did," Fagen added.

Becker turned to me. "That was why…." I waited for him to continue. He did not. So much for anecdotes.

They don't own a Scrabble game, as it turns out. The duck story "must have come from our doing interviews during the Hotel Bel-Air phase. They had ponds with swans and shit." However, that former ABC president did, they say, call them worms.

"We didn't deal with ABC for a long time," Becker said. "We were definitely on the shit list over there, can you believe it? And we didn't give 'em a hard time or anything. We have a great relationship with them now. They were just pissed at us for being…I don't know." He shrugged. "Worms, I guess."

Their contract with ABC runs out with the follow-up to Aja; rumor has it they will follow their producer, Gary Katz, to Warner Bros.


"Oh yeah," Becker confirmed. "We're going to Warner Bros. We've got one more with ABC of new material. Lemme see, then they have the rights to a greatest hits album. Steely Dan; the Golden Years, or I Remember Steely Dan.…"

"That Was the Steely Dan That Was," Fagen suggested.

"The Good Songs," Becker decided. "Then we'll be doing the same thing we're doing now, except for Warner Bros." Having just summed up the next, oh eight years of his life, Becker took another sip of Coke.

(Current ABC President Steve Diener, who wrote the liner notes for Aja, was anxious to comment: "I hope they stay with the label. I have a lot of respect for these guys. I really mean that. The reason I tolerate and even encourage them is it's necessary for their own creative perfection. But when they deliver…they deliver. They are a very special breed of cat, and that includes their producer, Gary Katz.")

"Really," added Fagen, about his and Becker's Working Process. "This is the job of the decade." He has, it seems, adapted his entire sense of humor to the nasality of his voice. "We're just sitting out the Seventies, waiting for better times…."

Becker and Fagen met ten years ago at Bard, a progressive college in upstate New York, "and we're tired of talking about it." They had the same eclectic tastes in jazz, and together began to write their own uniquely over-educated form of pop and rock. They floundered through several amateur bands — one of which was called the Bad Rock Group and included Chevy Chase on drums ("We don't remember him," says Fagen) — and eventually wound up playing with Jay and the Americans.

Becker and Fagen gladly relocated in Los Angeles when producer/friend Gary Katz took a West Coast staff job with ABC on the stipulation they be hired as Iabel songwriters. Katz promptly assembled around them a band that would play their material exclusively. He chose East Coast musicians he had worked with before: Denny Dias and Jeff "Skunk" Baxter on guitars and Jim Hodder on drums. Becker played bass; Fagen handled keyboards and, for the first time in his life, vocals. Another vocalist, David Palmer, was later added to help with stage presence. They were named after the William Burroughs dildo in Naked Lunch.

With Katz at the helm, Steely Dan recorded its debut album, Can't Buy a Thrill, and, amazingly, scored hit singles with "Do It Again" and "Reeling in the Years." "We had zero expectations," Becker remembered. "In fact, we were amazed that ABC bought the album at all." He snickered. "It was like a dream come true."

Steely Dan watched the dream fall apart on its first road trip. When the group wasn't playing the dives of America, it was visiting uninterested disc jockeys to plug the album. "The manager we had [Joel Cohen, author of Three Dog Night and Me] used to road manage Three Dog Night…that was basically his concept of how things should be done," explained Fagen. "Constant touring…and singles. We weren't well rehearsed at all. And the tours weren't well organized. We were always shuttling back and forth from the West to the East Coast. He felt we owed it to our singles audience."

This element of rock-biz etiquette didn't and still doesn't set well with Becker and Fagen, who turned their attentions to the second Steely Dan album. Fagen realized his own unharnessed vocals were best for the group, and David Palmer became the first to leave. The group locked itself in a small Santa Monica studio and concentrated on longer songs (such as "My Old School" and "Bodhisattva") with increased virtuosity, sometimes from outside musicians. The resulting Countdown to Ecstasy and the taunting single "Show Biz Kids" were as sophisticated a snub of the pop-rock treadmill as could be imagined. Neither were hits.

("We're enormously naive about certain business realities that most people take for granted," proclaimed Fagen. "I think that's a good thing.")

By the time of Pretzel Logic, Steely Dan's third album, the concept of a rock band as airtight touring-recording-touring unit had all but evaporated. The band, now including keyboardist/vocalist Michael McDonald, last performed live, briefly but expertly, in 1974. But the music had already taken a spectacular swing in the direction of forward-motion jazz.

Steely Dan built a new audience from the remains of the old. The band also gained much attention for its tradition of not listing detailed credits on its albums. It became a serious obsession among musicians to figure out who played which solos on Steely Dan records. Most of the time it wasn't the band members pictured on the album, but hired guns.

"That cold stigma about studio hacks," Fagen bristles, "is nonsense. You can get studio musicians to sound exactly like a rock & roll band."

Becker: "We don't feel it's something to be ashamed of. We had outside players on the first album. [Jimmy Page calls the Elliott Randall guitar solo in "Reeling in the Years" his all-time favorite.] The Beatles did it quite a bit, by their own admission. A lot of things Eric Clapton played…everyone thought it was George Harrison."


The original Steely Dan band dissolved soon after the 1974 tour, making official, says Becker, "the enlarged-band concept, if you will." Hodder and Dias returned to the lucrative freelance status. Baxter went on to join and spark the resurgence of the Doobie Brothers, later bringing with him Michael McDonald. Steely Dan became simply Walter and Donald, the journeymen be-boppers from Bard.

Becker: "It was unfair of us to spend eight months writing and recording when Jeffrey Baxter and others in the group wanted to tour. We weren't making very much money and everybody wanted to be out touring a lot. We didn't. That was that."

But touring is generally the means of amassing fortunes in the music business, and Becker and Fagen, with their costly taste in crack specialists, were going broke in a hurry. According to sources close to the band, they secretly signed with Warner Bros, in '74 and spent most of their advance buying out manager Cohen. Warner Bros., however, will admit to having them signed only since last year.

The relationship with Katz continued. ("Why shouldn't it?" asked Becker. "He has a moustache.") They next recorded Katy Lied, using players from all areas of expertise. "It was better sounding than anything you've ever heard to this date," recalls Gary Katz. "Even Aja. Unbelievable. We went to mix it, and the tape sounded funny. We found out the DBX noise reduction system we were using was not functioning properly."

Becker, Katz and engineer Roger Nichols took a midnight flight to the DBX factory in Boston and, after some work by experts, were told the malfunction had irreparably damaged the tapes.

It is a testimony to their studio prowess that the "flawed" sound on Katy Lied is still much advanced compared to any of the competition. "I am a fan first," Katz underscores. "It takes a long time to make an album that all three of us are really happy with. It's a three-way effort. One review like…the sterling production of Gary Katz, and I will take a good two, three days of abuse from those guys."

All three are predictably proud — and remarkably free of even playful sarcasm — in discussing their working relationship with such jazz musicians as Wilton Felder, Victor Feldman and particularly Larry Carlton. "In the past," said Becker, "it has been Larry who played most of the guitar solos. We're probably hardest on guitar players. But we get the best work. I suppose other people go into the studio and jam around and it's, 'Let's get something going,' until they get a few riffs that they can try and write some words around. We've real charts and everything. It's more productive. The musicians enjoy getting asked to do something that's challenging. We like working with an overview, too. It's difficult, but it's fun. It's not stupid music."

They have been known to discard entire tracks because of a single bad note. Six months later a musician may realize he's reading the same chart and playing the same song with a different band. "I imagine you have to have a certain jazz consciousness to understand what we're doing," said Fagen.

The Royal Scam, the fifth Steely Dan album, continued the lyrical descent into the seamy underside of society. It's a particular favorite of fanatics who savor Becker's and Fagen's Gordian Knot of oblique losers, dopers, ravaged lovers and doomed optimists. But the composers do not warm to specific questions.

"We actually think most of these songs are pretty funny," Fagen commented. "We don't construct them as puzzles. We try to tell a big story in a very short period of time. Naturally we have to exclude some information. We don't discourage any speculation."

Personal harassment from the hardcore devotees has fallen off in recent years, though Becker and Fagen still reminisce about the fellow who followed them across country to retrieve "the girlfriend." He had finally figured out what Becker and Fagen were talking about. They had her…and they were taunting him. "Ah well," Fagen said. "It tapers off when you're not touring."

Becker and Fagen now write off their announced plans for a fall return to touring as "speaking out of turn."

"We thought it might be a good idea again," Becker says. "We actually made one full start with a bunch of musicians. We're going to try again soon. I think maybe we underestimated the time we needed to start something from scratch and have it sound like…something, you know."

The problem, according to Katz, was the rude realization that they could no longer capture the increasingly intricate sound of Steely Dan on record with a few rehearsals.

"I push them so much…I do. It's selfish. I want to see it. They may not owe it to anybody, but they do owe it to themselves to go out and play," Katz says.

The plan now calls for the next Steely Dan album to be recorded by two different studio bands, each performing one side of material. One of the bands will then tour as Steely Dan. The songs will be written in New York this time. In the meantime, though, Becker and Fagen are staying in L.A. to compose the title song for manager Irving Azoff's film, FM.


"I don't particularly like L.A.," said Becker. "Nobody knows we're out there anyway." Their only recent public appearance, and that's stretching it, was when a small public-sponsored station invited them, on an outside chance, to conduct their own late-night radio show. Becker and Fagen showed up with armfuls of their favorite obscure jazz records and joyously took the station over for the night. "Radio Free Steely Dan," Becker announced, "is still open for offers."

In anticipation of Aja, Katz mounted a small campaign urging Becker and Fagen — who fancy themselves as more exclusive than reclusive — to take a higher profile. This included a meeting with Irving Azoff. "We were ready to go blissfully through life without a manager," said Fagen.

"We were doing fine, you know," Becker added. "Going out and looking for managers is like going out and looking for rattlesnakes. Irving impressed us with his taste for the jugular…and his bizarre spirit. He thought we could do much better about making America Steely Dan conscious. He wanted a new hobby. We figured, sure, take a shot."

Which, in itself, is quite a concession. Becker and Fagen are oblivious, even apathetic, about the pursuit of commercial or critical success. "We just keep the quality up for ourselves," Fagen insisted.

"We're proud that we don't have any bad cuts or at least ones that we think are inferior. These days most pop critics, you know, are mainly interested in the amount of energy that is... obvious on record. This is primitive rock & roll energy. People who are mainly Rolling Stones fans and people who like punk rock, stuff like that…a lot of them aren't interested at all in what we have to do."

I wondered if he intends to keep it that way. "I don't care," he said, slapping the chair again. "Doesn't mean that much to me. We have no idea who's out there buying our records."

Three weeks later, with Aja the first Steely Dan album to break into the Top Five, a visit to Irving Azoff was in order. I dropped in on Azoff at his Benedict Canyon home one Sunday while he was watching his beloved Rams — and one suspects a small investment of his own — succumb to the New Orleans Saints. Staring glumly at a huge Advent video screen, Azoff brightened only at the mention of Steely Dan.

"Here's how we did it," the twenty-eight-year-old megamanager chirped. "Simple strategy. Think of the biggest American supergroups. Fleetwood Mac. The Eagles, Chicago…." Azoff broke into a triple-platinum smile. "And Steely Dan. Everybody knows Steely Dan. They belong in that list. All we had to do was make it official."

His ambition for Becker and Fagen is fueled by the fact that he, like Katz, is a fan. Three years ago, Azoff was wearing out copies of Pretzel Logic. Now, having finally acquired Steely Dan, he is in the frenetic but enviable position of managing all of his favorite artists, including Boz Scaggs, the Eagles, Jimmy Buffet and Dan Fogelberg. "I used my power base," Azoff said, "and called all my rack-jobber friends — the guys in the field and the record chains — and I offered them Aja for a suggested $6.98 instead of the $7.98 list price. Most of them knew they could stock up early and retail it as if it were $7.98. They all bought two, three, four times as many as normally. I told them the offer would last two weeks.

"We never raised the price. And they kept selling. So here's this album that's Number Three in the country. What radio station isn't going to play a hit Steely Dan album. It's been the most-played album for weeks. We killed the Stones, didn't we?" Azoff paused to curse the Rams, who lost by two points. "It was fun," he resumed. "Those guys would have gotten there sooner or later anyway. They deserved it sooner."

I figured Azoff might be able to assist me in relocating Becker and Fagen — the new American superstars weren't answering their phones — for some last-minute reflections on their sudden explosion.

Azoff scoffed at this in are-you-kidding tones: "They could be anywhere. They haven't returned any calls in weeks. When those guys go underground, they disappear. I get no special privileges. They probably don't even realize they have a huge album."

The phone rings late on deadline night: it's the elusive Walter Becker calling long distance. Vacationing in Florida, he's in a frisky mood, reeling with stories about a new band whose sessions he's been attending: Root Boy Slim and the Sex Change Band Featuring the Rootettes. "This is a real laugh," he says.

Root Boy Slim is a figure straight out of Becker's and Fagen's musty backroom imaginations — a pudgy white blues singer of such deviant songs as "Bride of the Burro," "Christmas at K-Mart" and "Too Sick to Reggae." Becker and Fagen knew they'd been topped the instant they discovered him in a Baltimore nightclub. They cajoled Gary Katz, now equally rabid in his devotion, into producing and signing Root Boy Slim to Warner Bros. Now Becker and Fagen, at career peak, are at his sessions. Doing what? "Kibitzing," reports Becker.

Becker has to be steered in the direction of Aja. "I certainly don't think it's any more commercial than any of our other albums," he says. "I haven't heard it on the radio yet…but I read how well we're doing." He chuckles. "I guess we're achieving the success we so richly deserve. On the whole, I think this is a very rewarding thing."

I wonder how it feels, at least for tonight, to be bigger than the Rolling Stones. Walter Becker immediately balks at the comparison. Perhaps one can try too hard to extract the Secret Intentions of Steely Dan. So I simply ask if he feels as though he's in a band at all.

"No," Becker answers earnestly, "but we can get a real good one together in a hurry."

There are only two cars on Arthur Godfrey Road this early morning in Miami Beach. One, a Toyota, is full of punks looking for a party. They spot a rented Chevrolet carrying three men, older and looking rumpled in an eerie way. The Toyota pulls up alongside with a honk.

No reaction. Down roll the windows. It's five in the morning and an Aerosmith tape is blasting out of the Toyota. The guy behind the wheel leans out and yells: "Hey, let's go find some chicks!"

Then it registers. What? The driver nearly careens into a divider as he tries for a better look. It's ...

The three men ignore him. The Chevy turns off on Pine Tree Drive and slowly pulls into the driveway of a miniature villa. Just as the driver is about to shut off the ignition, a familiar song — "Woodstock" by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young—comes on the radio. The driver cranks it up, and all three begin to sing along.

"What a rush," whoops Graham Nash. He remembers his harmony line perfectly.

Stephen Stills is grinning broadly. His missing tooth is in full view.

David Crosby, the driver, stares straight ahead. "Yeah, we were definitely hot," he says, turning off the ignition at the song's end. "That love, peace and granola shit went over real big, didn't it?"

They laugh, grab their guitars out of the trunk and head inside. After five weeks of recording and living together in this spacious house, life has taken on a cuckoo-clockwork domesticity: up at 5 p.m., dinner at 6, Walter Cronkite at 6:30, recording studio at 8, then home for a sunrise breakfast.

"I'm just gonna put my guitar in my room," says Stills brightly. He bounds up the stairs. "Meet you guys in the kitchen for a nightcap. Save some Shredded Wheat for me. ..."

So Crosby, Stills and Nash—CSN—are back together. It's 1977, eight years since their first and only album became a rallying point for a budding Woodstock generation. But now, Richard Nixon is out of office, the war is over, marijuana is slowly being "decriminalized" and a Democrat is in the White House. Rock music is bigger business than ever, and artists like Peter Frampton and Fleet-wood Mac easily outsell the entire CSN catalog (with or without Neil Young) with a single album. Cameron Crowe has recently interviewed Van Morrison, Fleetwood Mac and Linda Ronstadt.

And yet, Young is back with his band, Crazy Horse, and CSN are back in the studio. Another turn around the wheel. ...

There was a time in late 1970, with Deja Vu at its peak, when CSNY were just about the American Beatles. The four of them had clear and separate, slightly adversary identities: Crosby, the former Byrd, the political voice, the California dreamer; Nash, the Briton, the former Hollie, the spiritually hungry searcher; Stills, the guitar hero from Buffalo Springfield; and Young, the brooding dark horse from Canada. They were, at once, steeped in mystique and still the guys next door.

"They always had that Judy Garland, tragic American hero aura about them," a former business associate remembers. "It's still going on. Were they strong enough to survive? Would they kill each other? Did they really like their audience? Were they leaders? Was it all for the bucks? Would they fall apart before reaching the top?"

In the end, they did fall apart. In 1970, after less than two years, CSNY shattered into four directions several months after recording the single "Ohio," backed, ironically, with "Find the Cost of Freedom." With the exception of a summer-long reunion for a tour in 1974, they never got together again. Apart and in partial combinations, their projects were mostly disappointing. But every year or so there was a tease. At least three times they announced attempts to record another CSNY studio album, but each one collapsed in bitterness. In their place, bands like the Eagles, whose members once idolized them, emerged.

And then, two months ago, I got a phone call and invitation from Crosby: "We're doin' it, man. It's CSN, just us this time, and it's coming out. C'mon down and have a listen." A plane flight later, I learned that he was right. For the first time since those nights in 1969, Crosby, Stills and Nash are in harmony. Only one question: does anybody out there still care?

Anything you want 
to know 
Just ask me 
I'm the world's most 
opinionated man*
—"Anything at All" 
by DAVID CROSBY

David Crosby is not quite ready for that one. He thinks about it for close to a minute, an uncommon silence for a man who calls himself "Ol' Motormouth." It is the next morning and Crosby is finishing off a snack of bacon and eggs. He dabs away the yolky residue caught in his waterfall moustache and smiles. "Sure, we may have blown it," he eventually admits. "But what constitutes blowing it? Not playing the game? I don't see any rules, anyway. ... Overall, I don't regret anything. I'm here and there's music ... and it's being released. And I'm making it. Sure, the specific things I regret. Pieces of music that were never made or never came out. ... but I'm glad that we were smitten in the face with reality again and again. If we'd had to knock those corners off each other rather than just bounding down a couple of staircases of life, I think there might have been too much scar tissue between us."

It's hard to keep from gagging on Crosby's constant paeans to The Music, but he is sincere. Music, by choice, is his "entire being ... with sex a very strong second." He lives his life from album to album and from tour to tour, rarely allowing himself any time home alone. At night he is often in the studios, either working on his own projects or cheering others on. And he spends his days ruminating over songs, letting petty business matters grow into problems.

Crosby, 35, has gained weight from lack of exercise, and he's sensitive about it. Propped up against the headboard of his bed, unshaven and wearing baggy cords and an oversized Pendleton shirt, he exudes a grand-fatherly benevolence.

In Miami nine months earlier, the last attempt at a CSNY album had left a particularly foul taste in his mouth. Yet Crosby is back for more. "I look at it this way," he once said. "Suppose you're crawling through the desert, you haven't had a drink in days, you're parched, dehydrating. And then you remember where you once drank from this deep, crystal blue oasis. Would you go back there or what?"

Boats drift along the canal outside, and Crosby smiles wistfully at the view. He begins to stare. I wonder if he looks back at himself and sees naivete. "You always do," he says with a world-weary sigh. "My whole 'Wooden Ships,' wanting-to-sail-forever fantasy was bullshit. Where do you get off leaving the rest of humanity behind, even in your mind? ... You live, you learn."

Crosby and Nash have remained close friends through the years. So all they needed to accomplish a CSN reunion was Stephen Stills. It is strange to hear Crosby answering for Stills' celebrated inconsistency. But he does so, and vigorously. "I'm not gonna hype him," he begins. "He's not a saint. He didn't suddenly change. The thing is ... you don't get it for free. You can't ride on your fucking laurels, it doesn't work for long."

Crosby doesn't like to get into specifics about personality differences with Stills, and says only: "He and I used to go nose to nose about once every 15 minutes. And we haven't gone nose to nose once. Nothing. It's either amazing grace or great luck, but it's working. ..."

He leans forward and speaks in a stage whisper, overenunciating every word: "His chemistry is altered because he is not drink-ing. . . . That cat, believe me, when he's heavy into the sauce, he doesn't have the chops, the attention span, the patience . . . he derails, he goes on trips ... he can't make the music. But when he feels supported and when it's called up out of him, bullshit on the people that think he can't do it. I'm proud to say that it happened to be us that could call it up out of him again. He says it, too."

They assume that Neil Young knows exactly what they're up to in Miami, using two months of studio time that Young himself wanted to book. But there has been no communication. He is spoken of in friendly but distant terms. Young views CSNY as an occasional marker in his own career, but CSNY comes first for the others. "I love singing with those guys," he said in 1975, "but CSNY tends to get too big. Too many people attach too much importance to them. I enjoy being able to visit, but I want to avoid people thinking, 'Oh, there's Neil Young from CSNY.'"

"At this point," Crosby says, "I don't know how to deal with my relationship to Neil at all. The last time the four of us were together, the psychic balance in the room, the level of trust, love or friendship was like" ... Crosby whistles ... "real strange."

That was last May, and the room was the very same Criteria Sound Studios. Recording sessions by the Stills-Young Band had reached an impasse. Young called Crosby to see about giving CSNY another shot. Crosby and Nash, close to finishing their own album, Whistling Down the Wire, in Los Angeles, flew to Miami Beach. It was a disastrous move. Besides a lack of material and some disagreement over the approach, there were rapidly approaching deadlines. A summer-long Stills-Young Band tour was scheduled to begin in June, and Crosby and Nash were already late delivering their own album. They finally had to rush back to L.A. to wrap it up, leaving Stills and Young to work on the CSNY album until they returned. Instead, the album reverted to a Stills-Young project. Crosby and Nash were not invited back to Florida, and their vocals were wiped off the tracks to make room for others.

Crosby was livid at the time. "I have nothing but contempt for those two," he said then. "I refuse to be on call for them any longer." Now, he can rationalize the incident: "Everything was wrong. I wish to fuck, man, that I had not felt so long an enmity for those cats over that."

In the end, the Stills-Young tour fell apart after a month. Crosby and Nash played throughout the summer, and the incredible irony occurred: the two harmony singers, the leftover pieces of the old group, outsold the Stills-Young album (Long May You Run).

The phone rings and Crosby snaps it up, as he usually does whenever a ringing telephone is within reach. It's John Hartmann, one of Crosby and Nash's managers. "Yeah? ... I'm just shooting my mouth off. ... Well, how's things on that battlefront? ... What did the Turk say? ... Did you call the Russian? What did he say? ... Well, play it for him. Our end is together. ..."

It is an easily breakable code since I know that CSN, still signed to Atlantic Records (where Ahmet Ertegun, "the Turk," is chairman), want to find out whether or not there might be another company that wants to buy them out, like, maybe, the only label that could afford them, CBS Records (whose president is Walter Yetnikov, "the Russian"). Crosby hangs up.

"We're having a huge business duke-out at the moment," he says, "which is what all that was about. You know, we're spread out all over the record business. At present we're on three different companies [Crosby and Nash are on ABC. Stills is with CBS as a solo artist]. It's weird that it should be fought over like 40 pieces of silver. But we know what it is in terms of its commercial worth. We know what happens when you make sounds as unusual and completely different from everything else as this does.

"If all somebody has to relate to, in terms of what's gonna come out of this, is Whistling Down the Wire and the Stills-Young Band, they're in for a monster surprise."

A striking blond woman, the cook and part owner of the agency that rented the house, pokes her head in the door and announces dinner. And so begins the prestudio ritual.

Downstairs, a spectacular spread is being attacked by Stills and Nash, by Joel Bernstein, their photographer of seven years, and by their young crew of three. Dinner is over in ten minutes; then they watch CBS news for their nightly crash course on the real world. CSN like Jimmy Carter. They had talked about announcing their reunion by singing "The Star Spangled Banner" at his Inaugural Ball. Crosby, oddly enough, is the biggest fan of the president. The same man who had in the past proclaimed himself "ashamed to be an American" would gladly accept an invitation to the White House. "The Constitution is still strong enough to beat Richard Nixon," he says. "Bottom line, man: dude lost." As for Carter: "I feel that the guy is so intelligent that he knows how to be human and accessible and real. It's sheer genius. ..."

After Cronkite, they zip down to the studio. As he walks in, Crosby triumphantly claps his hands. "All right," he booms. "We're gonna finish the album tonight."

He has said the same thing every night at the same time for the last five weeks.

The album will be called simply CSN. Outside of keyboardist Craig Doerge, drummer Joe Vitale, bassist George "Chocolate" Perry and one track with drummer Russ Kunkel, the album is all their own work. It was coproduced by Ron and Howard Albert, the earnest young brothers who have had a hand in nearly everything that's come out of the Miami studios since Brook Benton's "Rainy Night in Georgia" in 1970. The Alberts are quick, thorough and determined to make a Seventies CSN album. They are succeeding.

Tonight, with the instrumental tracks finished, the moment of truth has arrived—after four days of rehearsal, it's time to record vocals. They've been singing all night, carefully bearing down to capture the harmonies.

Stephen Stills stands in the middle of the carrot-colored Studio B—the same gauche room where Eric Clapton recorded "Layla" and James Brown did "I Feel Good"—and madly smokes himself into a Marlboro cloud. He is on the crest of finishing a difficult, overdubbed vocal part on "Anything Crosby's At All." Graham Nash watches from Stills' left. Crosby is lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling and calling out suggestions. "Hey," he gripes. "I keep hearing the Average White Band gettin' down in the next room."

Stills ignores the gentle thumping and continues his last remaining line several times without much success. Ron Albert flicks down the intercom switch. "You're flat, Stephen." "I've made a whole career out of singing flat," replies Stills. He returns to the line, tries more times, and then gets it perfect.

The Alberts, who've worked on most of Stills' solo projects, begin to talk between themselves. They don't know I'm sitting on a couch below their control board.

"Do you believe this?" asks Howard. "I don't believe this."

Ron chuckles. "Did you ever think we'd see the day when Stills worked this hard on a record? Is this for real?"

"He wasn't this on top of it for the first Manassas, even, was he? That was a great album ... the last classic record he made. ..."

Stills walks in and the musing immediately stops. He plops on a stool between the two brothers to hear his playback. "You know," Stills confesses out of the blue, "I've been getting away with murder. I think back on my solo albums, and there's some good stuff here and there ... but it's mostly garbage, isn't it?"

I can see the Alberts' reflection in the studio window as they turn to each other. "Pretty much, Stephen," Ron says agreeably.

Stills begins to laugh heartily, something his friends say he's only recently capable of, until Crosby, still on his back in the next room, roars over the monitor: "All I wanna know is this—are we gonna have to give the AWB credit for percussion on this album?" Everyone cracks up.

They decide to knock off a bit and play me the 12 album tracks, chosen from a possible 17. All three stand and sing their unrecorded parts with the tape.

Here's the rundown: "Shadow Captain"—Craig Doerge wrote the music, Crosby the words . . . instantly recognizable, streamlined CSN, clear and strong. "See the Changes"—classic three-part harmonies huddled around an acoustic guitar; Stills wrote and sang lead. "Carried Away"—a beautifully stark Nash piano song with interwoven harmonies. "Fair Game"— Cubano Stills, well sung and brandishing a killer acoustic guitar solo. "Anything At All"—a deeply felt Crosby composition about a man who will answer any question." Cathedral" — Nash started this song on his 33rd birthday after wandering into Winchester Cathedral on acid. Intense. Side two: "Dark Star"—another great Stills song, overtly commercial and made for summer. "Just a Song before I Go"—a breezy love song from Nash (whispered Crosby: "The girls are gonna fall in love with him all over again. I hate it."). "Run from Tears"—the best electric Stills in years, with chilling vocals and a fiercely real lyric about keeping his head above water. "Cold Rain"—written by Nash during the sessions after returning from his ailing mother's bedside in England. Gray and moody. "In My Dreams"—Crosby stretches out with a sinuous acoustic tune. "I Give You Give Blind"—more excellent electric Stills. A sophisticated, assertive closing note.

I'm just hoping that it ... just slays everybody. I really want it to so bad, you know. For me, it's kind of half out of responsibility to the kids and half 'I'll show 'em ... thought we were washed up, didja?'"

Stephen Stills is a man with a reputation for being fucked up, coked out and/or fried to the gills. He concedes that he has done plenty to deserve that stigma, but, against incredible odds, he has survived. And his survival is one of the most important factors in the successful reunion of CSN.

To look at Stills today, at 32, you see a much different person than the gaunt, eager young man who confessed to the audience at Woodstock that he was "scared shitless." His face has spread out and hardened since then. He often wears glasses. He is smaller and huskier than you might expect.

"Right now, I'm a cripple," Stills says, taking a seat in the closet-sized mastering room at Criteria. "I've been sick through this whole thing. Then my back went ... God knows what did that. It's probably all psychosomatic." He gets up to grab an ashtray and bangs his head on a tape machine. "Oh-ho. My body is rebelling. But ... I've been working solid for six months. You know, the light is at the end of the tunnel. ... I'm just hoping my poor body holds up long enough to get to it."

Stills is just now recovering from a particularly devastating stretch of his life that began with the release of Long May You Run last August. First Neil Young dropped off the summer tour of the Stills-Young Band after only a month, allegedly because of a sore throat. Others have suggested Young was bored. Says Stills: "All I know is that he turned left at Greensboro. ..."

I remember calling Stills on the road in Atlanta, the next stop after Greensboro, for some backup questions on a piece I was writing. I didn't know the roof had just fallen in.

Stills, who was in a hotel bar, grunted something about wanting to be left alone and brusquely explained that Neil had disappeared and left him a goodbye telegram saying, "Funny how some things that start spontaneously, end spontaneously. ..."

"I have no answers for you," Stills had said then. "I have no future." Chills. Two weeks later, still gamely making up on some canceled dates without Young, Stills' wife Veronique Sanson, a singer/songwriter, filed for divorce. Stills ordered everything packed and moved out of his home near Boulder, Colorado, where the marriage started. He now lives in L.A. and has not been back to Colorado since.

"Lenny Bruce was right," says Stills. "When you get divorced, the longer you've been married, the longer you throw up. I'm not over it yet. "I went crazy for two weeks, you know, but I picked myself up off the ground and went to the studio. I guess there wasn't anyplace else to put my energy. It was like the coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons, just after he goes off the cliff ... suspended in midair, scrambling to get back to the cliff."

I am drowning 
And I am fighting. 
Something special 
Is in me dying . . .** 
"Run from Tears" 
by STEPHEN STILLS

Stills started writing his best songs in many years, all of them passionately autobiographical. He also started to think about his still bitter friends, Graham Nash and David Crosby. Stills humbly showed up backstage, uninvited, at a Crosby/Nash show at the Greek Theatre in L.A.

NASH: "I hugged him. And it amazed me. 'Cause I realized in the middle of the hug that the last time we'd met he'd wiped some very valuable work of David's and mine ... but it didn't matter. We're all incredibly changeable people, God knows, and Stephen had come with his hat in his hand. So fuck it. I hugged him."

CROSBY: "After that last debacle, I looked at Nash like he'd lost his total mind. I thought he was just out of his fucking tree. Completely. Then I hugged Stills too ... the pencil-neck wimp."

Stills joined in for the last encore number, "Teach Your Children," and his bruised ego soaked up the tumultuous reception. Afterward Stills and Nash, long the weakest link in CSNY, went out and got drunk. "He was really the Stephen that I had always hoped I'd see back again. I piled him back into his room at 4 a.m." Crosby and Nash continued with a fall tour, as did Stephen with a series of solo acoustic concerts, but the reunion was already on their minds.

They met up in December, recorded some basics at the Record Plant in Los Angeles, then flew to Miami to finish the album. The key to the sudden harmony? "Everybody is a lot less sensitive," Stills replies. "We have a common, realized interest. We took a tremendous gamble the first time with Nash quitting the Hollies and everything. ... Music from Big Pink was out and all that ... we really had to be good. And we were. We're up against the same thing now. We're taking a gamble with our reputations ... the pressure's on."

I tell Stephen there are some who point to his lack of drinking as a major plus factor. He laughs tentatively. "I mean," he says, "I've always been a cheap drunk." He looks sheepish. "I've spent a lot of time drinking Scotch onstage and stuff ... I just quit. It was seriously interfering with my ability to perform, to sing in tune. It made me braver, but I just wasn't pulling it off. I sat in with the Average White Band, man, the other night and I had three gulps of Scotch and I was just blind. Just ... completely ... on ... the roof. I have definitely quit."

Directly after the CSN project, Stills will finish another solo album. He has asked Graham Nash to produce. After that, he says, he will concentrate on CSN indefinitely. He does not miss another guitarist, particularly Neil Young.

"The album we did was a nice avant-garde piece. I can see why it didn't do better. We were a little off-hand about it. There were some special songs in there that we could have treated ... a little more special. "Neil is Neil and CSN is CSN. That has always been true. I think Neil does" ... Stills sighs ... "what the hell he wants, you know. And he puts as much energy into it as ... he wants. That can be 100% or it can be 75% ... and he really doesn't give a damn. My relationship with Neil is certainly not severed. I mean, none of us are into closing doors."

There is always the specter of money looming over such reunions as this, just as it did when CSNY reformed in '74 for an album ... and a summer tour. The album never happened ... but the question begs to be asked: is it for the money?

"It isn't," Stills declares. He is, naturally, offended. "We're not broke. We've all got money coming in from other sources. But we're gonna make a lot of money, nice bucks. And we're also gonna deliver. We gotta . . . and we're gonna. And that supersedes the money and everything . . . I mean, there's not one disco track on the album. How could it be for the money?"

I thank Stills for his time and venture to tell him that there are people who will be very surprised by his strong showing on the CSN album. "Hey, don't ever count this boy out," he advises. "Don't ever count me out."

Stills jumps to his feet for a dramatic exit on that line. And bumps his head on the tape machine again.

In the past few years Graham Nash has developed the public image of an exasperated Richard Benjamin struggling to reunite the Sunshine Boys. In the aftermath of the various breakups, it is he who has been left most dejected, wondering why everybody just can't act like adults. In the span of their history, Nash has never initiated any of their notorious blowouts.

Graham is the quintessential gentleman, able to make instant and lasting friends. A promo man he's just met can become "my friend Bill," a fan who wants to talk about "Lady of the Island" will not be ignored. He is good-humored, sensible, warm and open, yet very private.

This morning he sits on the expansive backyard lawn, next to the rushing canal, chipping away at an alabaster sculpture. From 20 yards away, I recognize it—an amazing bust of David Crosby—and ask why he would want to spend an excruciating amount of time sculpting the face of someone he has seen practically every day for the last eight years. Nash says he couldn't help it. The rock just looked like Crosby.

Nash is wearing tiny antique goggles. He throws his head back into the sunlight. "I feel fine," he says. "Some of the rushes I remember from that first album—when we hit a vocal chord or a vocal blend—I've had the same rushes here for the first time since. That's why I'm so peaceful about it all."

Last night, after first hearing the Eagles' "Hotel California," Nash had lifted a defiant middle finger to the line: "We haven't seen that spirit here/Since 1969."

Nash probably has the keenest sense of the group as something more than an old spirit. In recent years he's been responsible for compiling the Four Way Street and So Far albums, putting together set lists for their concerts and even sequencing the latest album. And he is a brilliant arranger and producer.

But he has loftier goals in life, you sense, than writing "Our House." "I tend to get a little into the importance of what I'm doing, because I'm so focused on it. I have to maintain the ability to be able to step outside and realize that all this doesn't mean shit to ... that palm tree." He would rather see his friend and inspiration, Jacques Cousteau, on the cover of Rolling Stone.

Nash has gone through several complete life changes since growing up in Manchester, England. And he is certainly capable of several more. When he was 15, his father bought an antique camera from a friend. The camera turned out to be stolen and when the police came around, William Nash refused to divulge any information. He went to jail for a year and his only son, Graham, went to work to support his mother and two sisters. Graham took odd jobs in a wool factory, a brewery and a post office to keep the family afloat. He soon made enough money from singing and playing guitar with a buddy, Allan Clarke. Together they became the nucleus of the Hollies. Nash Sr. emerged from prison weak from pneumonia and broken in spirit. He died a year later while Graham was on tour in Sweden. Graham's chartered plane arrived a few hours too late. Missing a farewell to his father, he says, is his only regret in life.

The Hollies were a huge success. They developed a rigid, faultless formula that was something of a mixed blessing. By 1968 Nash had broken out of the mold and was writing "Lady of the Island," "Marrakesh Express" and "Right between the Eyes," songs the other Hollies vetoed. When the group reached L.A. for a run at the Whisky A Go Go, Graham made friends with Cass Elliott, who brought him to Joni Mitchell's Laurel Canyon home. The rest has become well-drilled history. That night Nash met Crosby and Stills and sang with them. He promptly discarded a budding middle-class existence—the O Lucky Man syndrome as Crosby calls it—with $100 in his pocket. His momentous departure from the Hollies is still remembered in England: "Every time I go back there," says Nash, "I still feel this strange edge. ..."

I guess I'm taking a chance, moving out here to L.A., leaving my money in England and singing with David and Stephen. But it's what I want. At least it is for now.

           September 1969

We take a little break. Someone has brought wine and cheese and fruit and deli. Graham and Joni are getting silly together. Stephen is muttering about getting back to work. David is slumped on the couch, cuddling a bottle of wine. He closes his eyes and his mouth curls into a smile. "I've never had so much fun making an album in my entire life. 
Hit Parader, 
September 1969

By the time CSNY, Crosby, Stills and Nash—with Neil Young—reached the studio in 1970 for Deja Vu, they were the American group. But the sunshine and light of the first album had dissipated. "When it's that enormous, all of the chemistry is heated up," says Crosby. "Everything takes place faster and bigger ... your own emotions included. It went downhill as a relationship, and it's as equally divided a fault as I can think of ... all four of us blew it. Everybody got paranoid about each other. We were all independent enough motherfuckers to go and do it on our own. We all thought we could."

There were personal difficulties as well. Nash and Joni Mitchell were about to break up, Stills and Judy Collins split, Neil and Susan Young were separating, and Crosby's "one true love," Christine Gail Hinton, had been killed in a Hollywood car accident.

"It was an incredibly painful album," says Graham. "The first one, we were all madly in love. The second, we weren't even close." The sessions were moody, sullen marathons and the vibe even carried over to their subsequent tour. Stills was fired in Chicago, reinstated two days later, but when the tour ended, they scattered.

An attempt to reunite on record in '73 got as far as a finished package and title, Human Highway. They went to Hawaii to rehearse, came back and ran out of impetus. The cover photo, taken at sunset on their last day in the islands, tells it all—a clear portrait of four tanned men, all living in completely separate worlds. The print is now tacked up on Neil Young's bedroom wall at his ranch.

Another stab at CSNY happened in Sausalito after the summer '74 tour. It ended after several weeks, as a result of a momentous argument between Nash and Stills over a single harmony note. Neil Young left the studio and never returned. "It was an incredible thing to have happen," says Nash. "I didn't quite know how to deal with that for a long time. But it served its purpose by pushing David and me out onto the crossroads."

They were an obvious match, Crosby and Nash. They had already toured and made an album together, but this was a matter of an entire career. The turning point was an unexpected call from James Taylor, who wanted them to sing on his album Gorilla. They accepted (Nash: "We're music junkies, we'll sing for anybody") and in the course of one high, musical evening, recorded Taylor's "Mexico" and "Lighthouse." Graham and David, then living at the Chateau Marmont residential hotel, floated around L.A. in a haze for days, singing the chorus from "Mexico." They had proven to themselves that they were more than retread folkies.

Crosby and Nash — working without a manager at the time—rode the blast of confidence into a deal with ABC Records and an album, Wind on the Water, assisted by Carole King and Taylor. A successful tour was followed by another album, then the abortive trip to Miami Beach. And now this.

"Ah yes," Nash notes. "Here we are in the years, as they say." He chips away on his sculpture of Crosby. "Back on bended knees."

No, Nash decides, he would not take it all back. "It was so strange going back to Manchester this time," he says. "I still see the exact same faces and ruddy complexions and the people scurrying by ... and they'll never change. But for a few good fortunes, I might still be there." He shudders. "No, I would not go back."

I mention the Rolling Stone interview in which John Lennon claimed he'd rather have been a fisherman in Surrey. A voice from behind responds: "Crap he would." It's Crosby, rubbing his eyes in the sunlight. "He just damn well wouldn't ... he wouldn't have settled for it, because he's one of the ones that left home. Like us. There's always some of them that leave home. ... They're too dissatisfied or restless or horny or something. And we're the ones that left. You're one of 'em. He's one of 'em ... or else he'd still be in the wool factory. I'm one of 'em ... or else I'd be back in Santa Barbara now, working for Washburn Chevrolet."

As far as I'm concerned," says Crosby, "the best thing for me to think about Neil Young is: later. Because if he showed up, right now, he'd just weird it out. He can't do the kind of painstaking work on vocals that we're doing right now. He doesn't believe in it. He can't even sit there while you do it. And he's proven that." Crosby chipmunk giggles. "He'd rather clunk around with that garbanzo band of his. ..."

"I really wonder what he's gonna think when he hears this album," Crosby says. "I hope it makes him think. He's not doing justice to his records. And it's bullshit. I've done the same thing in another way, I'm sure, but I think that's really true. I hope he listens to this album and says, 'Oh shit, I shouldn't settle for less.' That would be great."

I remind Crosby that Young has gone on record as saying he made a commercial, technically perfect album in Harvest and "got it out of my system."

"That's just an excuse to not have to do it," Crosby retorts. "That's a shuck. He makes stuff, man, that if you listen to it the right way, it has moments of such startling art in it that you can be knocked out by it. But he could take his music much farther. He's also got this massive anti-God thing. He hates being so big and he tries to demystify himself by being funky. In music and in life. I've argued all these things with him, to his face. He laughs. He loves it. Bottom line? Neil's the most fascinating person I've ever met."

A laborious detailing of all the various unreleased CSNY tracks now sitting in the can follows, and Crosby begrudgingly admits each one's existence after much arguing. After several hours, we figure there is at least one great CSNY album among the tape archives of each member.

Nash, who has said little, interrupts as he senses yet another argument looming. "This is getting boring," he declares, and a few minutes later he grabs his sculpture and walks back inside. Not quite realizing the reason for Nash's departure; Crosby follows him. I follow Crosby. The conversation resumes in Nash's room.

"Please," Nash pleads, "don't drive me out of my room. I came in here to escape you all."

"Sorry," Crosby says, "it's his fault. He didn't ask me my favorite questions—what I have to say to the 15-year-old girls of America, what kind of weird sex trips I'm into, where I buy my clothes, nothing."

Nash remains serious. "None of the stuff we've talked about has been important. . . it's just part of a vast complex of much more important things. And we're a small part. Right now, 'cause we're all in this house, it's a large part of our lives, but if you take it from the point of view of the guy next door . . . he doesn't give a fuck, you know."

Back in my room, it's unnerving to think about this, staring at six hours of tape. Sure, it's historically valid to gather all the details, all the intricacies of each split, but . . . in the end, isn't the reality that CSNY are four guys who couldn't manage to sit down in one room long enough to make the very music they say they live for? In ten years, is that the irresponsible legacy they intend to leave?

I take that last question back to Nash's room. He and Crosby are engrossed in a Jacques Cousteau TV special. Crosby looks up, sees me and the tape recorder back again, and beckons. "What's your last big question of Doom and Destiny?"

It is a difficult question to phrase, and it comes out as: "Look at the fans who loved Crosby, Stills and Nash and Deja Vu and thought they were some of the best LPs in their collections. They've followed you through all the breakups, the false alarms, the canceled tours and partial reunions, and there still hasn't been another album. Might they not be tired of it all? After all, there's the new Pink Floyd album. ..."

Silently, Crosby continues to watch television. "Look at the geese! Look at the geese!" he says. Another minute. "I don't know. It'll depend on how much music was the issue or the fantasy characters that the media tried to create. If it was the music that moved them, I'm sure that the on-again, off-again rest of it isn't that relevant.

"If, on the other hand, they were more concerned with the psychodrama of the group trips ... and flashed by the bullshit star thing, then maybe they've moved on from that to something else, like gas stations and Parcheesi. "Overall, you can't look at your life with regret ... and do shit. So no, I don't regret. I ... I look for my car keys and go to the studio." Crosby laughs and dangles the car keys from his finger.

Nash is troubled by the lack of sensitivity in his answer. "I agree, David," he says. "I totally concur, I was just thinking about the crux of the question, which was—do we think we were silly. In a certain way I think we were very silly ... in not growing up quite so fast."

Joel Bernstein, their photographer and guitar-tuner of seven years, is also in the room and adds: "This all must seem so childish to someone on the outside."

"Fuck 'em," says Crosby. "I can't live my life for them. I'm telling you what the truth is."

"It's just," Bernstein resumes, "if you put yourself in the fans' place, you can maybe see how their attitude toward you guys may have changed."

NASH: "It's possible."

CROSBY: "Okay ... that's very distant from me, okay, but I'll respond. It is fringe. The only real consideration that anybody ever had to think about was whether or not the music got to them. Anybody that's into it to the level of following it as a psychodrama is fringe to me."

BERNSTEIN: "I'm not talking about those people. I'm talking about your fans . . . the people who buy your records."

NASH: "Well, we're taking care of things. We're doing this album. ..."

CROSBY: "I'm talking about all the fans, then. Everybody. Merely being conscious of them and what they care about and how they feel about whether or not we should or should not be playing is counterproductive to making art. So fuck you, number one.

BERNSTEIN: "That's contrary to your criticism of Neil and his craft."

CROSBY: "I'm not talking about how you make the music. I'm talking why. I'm desperately concerned with communication. Just let me finish. What went down is that . . . we tried over and over again because we wanted to do the music. We didn't try because we felt a pressure or need to satisfy these other people's predilections for one thing or another—fuck them. They can't help me or hinder me from making that magical moment on tape. Only my own personal love or hatred or feeling for ... [the blood rushes to Crosby's face and he begins to bellow] ... Neil, Stephen and Graham has anything to do with it. Only. Nothing else. So their whole entire consciousness — whether they liked it, didn't like it ... thought it was cool, hip, chicken, fucked ... nothing. It's all totally extraneous to me."

Nash stops chipping on Crosby's bust and looks up curiously. "And it's totally, totally intimidating of the one fucking chance you got to break through and make this happen. The consciousness of that bullshit, the history and psychodrama and what everybody else is thinking about it is exactly why the four of us walked into the room the last time and ... blew it! Because we were dragging that baggage. Can you dig it? Fuck you, number two!"

Crosby catches his breath. "That's why we keep looking at each other, the three of us, and saying, 'No history—next subject.' That's not a joke. That's trying to keep from drowning. Excuse me for getting a little intense. But it's our music ... that's why we make it for ourselves.

"People are gonna listen to this, I know, and wonder how 'right on' it will be. Well, CSNY and CSN was a rallying point because it was just a shared experience. Like Easy Rider was. Not because of anything we planned ... we're not leaders. There isn't a leader in us. But if I started to think about all those people out there and what's gonna satisfy each and every one of them, how far am I gonna get?"

NASH: "He understands that. You explained to him about cheese. He thinks he tried to ask you about bacon."

"No," Crosby states flatly. "Suck cheese, English." For a moment, he sounds and looks like Larry Mundello, the easily bruised neighborhood kid from the old Leave It to Beaver TV show. "No, I nailed it."

Howard Albert had stumbled across someone pissing in the bushes outside as he walked into the studio that night. A few minutes later Albert had found out who he was when a wiry, bearded man in Levi's and checked shirt wandered in the front door.

"Was that you out there?" Albert asked.

"Sure, man," he said with a crooked smirk. "Jus' out there takin' a leak on a warm evening."

Neil Young had come to see Crosby, Stills and Nash. He walked into the control room unannounced and four men lunged to hug one another. "Big problem with CSNY," Young cracked. "Too much hugging." To see them all together in one dimly lit room was an incredible sight — like watching four big old gray timber wolves circling.

A tape of CSN—now completed and needing only final mixing — was slipped on and, with the opening notes of "Shadow Captain" booming over the speakers, Neil stared down in bemused fascination. When the first three-part vocals filled in, he looked up and smiled broadly. "It's nice to hear that," he said. "Real good to hear it again." Young listened on with warm enthusiasm. After the last track on side one, while the second was being hurriedly readied, he insisted on a break. "Hey guys, c'mon," said Young. "You spend eight years making your second album and you want to get it over with in 45 minutes ...

"Sheesh."


Fuck it . . . Peter Green didn't want his £30,000 a year. The money was royalties from his work with his old blues band, Fleetwood Mac. He'd quit the band in 1970, saying he wanted to live a Christian life. He gave his money away and eventually took various menial jobs, including one as a gravedigger.

But now, as more and more people acquaint themselves with Fleetwood Mac and dig back to old reissues, this money keeps arriving. He tries to get rid of it, but it's all just such a bother. "I want to lead a new life," he would say. "I don't want to be followed around by the past."

When Green could tolerate it no longer, he paid his accountant a visit, brandishing a pump-action .22 shotgun. He wanted the money stopped.

Soon Green was standing in Marlebone Court in London, listening calmly as the judge read his verdict. Peter Green, blues-guitar-star-turned-ascetic, was ordered committed to a mental institution.

After ten years and a particularly lean time just before the group's 1975 smash, Fleetwood Mac, broke loose, everybody loves this quiet little British-American band that could.

Fleetwood Mac's music has evolved into a sophisticated pop and rock sound that's just right for the Seventies, thanks primarily to two women, old-timer Christine McVie and newcomer Stevie Nicks. The group's latest album is being shipped out in greater quantities than any other record in the history of Warner Bros. There are, of course, reasons for Warners' optimism: Fleetwood Mac produced three hit singles ("Over My Head" and "Say You Love Me" by McVie; "Rhiannon" by Nicks), sold 4 million units, has danced around the top half of the album charts for over 80 weeks and is Warner's all-time best seller.

And adding to everyone's enthusiasm were shows like the one at L. A.'s Universal Amphitheater last fall. There, in front of an adoring crowd that included Elton John and two princesses of Iran, Fleetwood Mac looked like they were feeling good. New energy was being supplied by Stevie Nicks and the other most recent addition, guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. What with Buckingham prowling around the stage, dropping feisty lead runs into all the right places, and singer Nicks playing the whirling dervish Welsh witch Rhiannon, the group's dignified reserve was clearly a thing of the past.

Even drummer Mick Fleetwood finally ventured out from behind his drum kit to play the African talking drum on "World Turning." And Christine McVie, Fleetwood Mac's brandy-voiced keyboardist of six years, recently overcame a phobia against talking with the audience. Only John McVie, perhaps in the grand tradition of bassists, remains impassive and faultlessly proficient.

But one would soon learn that their minds were elsewhere – namely, in the tiny studio across town from the Amphitheater, where they were still struggling to finish their very late followup LP, a trouble-child called Rumours.

Work on the album began in February '76, immediately after the group had introduced their new lineup on a marathon six-month cross-country tour. Traveling to the Record Plant Studios in Sausalito, just north of San Francisco, Fleetwood Mac had walked straight into an emotional holocaust. Christine and John McVie, married for almost eight years, had recently split up and weren't speaking to each other. Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were about to do likewise. And Mick Fleetwood certainly wasn't talking to anybody. The father of two children, he and his wife Jenny were in the midst of divorce proceedings.

500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Fleetwood Mac, Rumours

"Everybody was pretty weirded out," Christine McVie explained. "Somehow Mick was there, the figurehead: 'We must carry on . . . let's be mature about this, sort it out.' Somehow we waded through it."

They returned to Los Angeles, but the tapes from their nine weeks in the Sausalito studio – many of them mangled by a "recording machine" that earned the nickname "Jaws" – sounded strange wherever they played them. They were almost resigned to starting all over when one of their crew found a cramped dubbing room in the porno district of Hollywood Boulevard, a studio that perfectly accommodated what they had recorded. A fully booked fall tour was canceled, and there, while films like Squirm and Dick City played next door, Fleetwood Mac started the mixing process. As the songs took shape, the album began to sound like True Confessions: the band's three writers – Christine McVie, Nicks and Buckingham – were all writing about their crumbled relationships.

As they added finishing touches to an album more intimate than they had ever anticipated, the band firmly closed their studio doors. "It was clumsy sometimes," said John McVie. "I'm sitting there in the studio and I get a little lump in my throat – especially when you turn around and the writer's sitting right there." So they asked that interviews be done with each member separately.

I always did have a kind of candle shining for Peter Green. I mean, he was my god. I thought, 'Give me one chance at him . . .'"

Christine McVie, who looks considerably younger than her 33 years, grew up alongside Fleetwood Mac on the British blues circuit.

Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are loath to dwell on Fleetwood Mac's many past lives, but sitting in this cluttered office adjoining the studio where she has just finished mixing "Songbird" for Rumours, Christine is happy to play the keeper of the Fleetwood Mac legacy.

She pours a tall glass of white wine and surprises even herself with a fan's diary that is by turns melancholy and passionate. "I dearly remember the old days . . . Fleetwood Mac had this one-of-a-kind charm. They were gregarious, charming and cheeky onstage. Very cheeky. They'd have a good time. Peter Green just made the audience laugh at this funny little cocky Jewboy. Jeremy Spencer was really dirty onstage. At the Marquee one night he put a dildo in his trousers, came out and did an impersonation of Cliff Richard. Half the women left, escorted out by their boyfriends." Green had also created a dark, mystical aura about the band. "They had this tremendous, subtle power," says Christine.

By the time she made friends with the group, Christine Perfect was already a journeywoman blues-circuit rocker herself. As a "real tubby" teenager – she weighed 160 pounds at 16 – Christine and a girlfriend/singing partner snuck away from their strict parents in Birmingham and visited every talent agency they could find in London. Their act consisted of strumming guitars and warbling Everly Brothers hits. Their career, which was highlighted by a one-song pub appearance backed by the Shadows, was cut short when their parents found them out. Christine was sent to art college in Birmingham where she joined a folk club. "We'd meet every Tuesday night, above a pub somewhere, and drink cheap beer. Whoever could, would play a folk song or violin, whatever they could do. Anyway, one night in strolls this devastatingly handsome man, who was from Birmingham University. It was Spencer Davis. I just fell in love with Spence. I swore I would get thin and go out with him.

"And I did."

Christine and Spencer began singing together, fronting the university's jazz band, but, she says, their relationship proved "more musical than illicit."

"Stevie Winwood was about 14, still in school and playing at a jazz club called the Chappel Pub at lunch-time," Christine says. "He met Spencer and they formed the Spencer Davis Group.

"I used to trail around religiously. Boy, they were so hot. Nothing was like that. Stevie Winwood played like I'd never heard anybody play before. It just gave me goose bumps. They were just a blues band, but a really, really great blues band. He [Winwood] could yell the blues. A 15-year-old boy. No one could believe it. The 19-20-year-old girls would have the hots for him."

Christine joined another blues band called Chicken Shack. The gruesome cover photo, showing severed fingers in a can, won an art award for their first album, Forty Blue Fingers Packed and Ready to Serve. "We had an underground following," Christine deadpans.

Chicken Shack did occasional gigs with Fleetwood Mac, and Christine, now playing piano, was invited to guest on some of Fleetwood's early sessions because she "played the blues the way Peter liked." She never had designs on any of the band, she says. Besides, both Green and McVie already had girlfriends.

Christine stops and slaps her forehead. "I'm forgetting a whole two-year episode with a Swedish guy I was engaged to. Ended up totally traumatizing my kitten who hated me evermore 'cause I just ran around the house screaming when he left me. I scared the shit out of it."

Caught up in her storytelling, Christine is not the same woman Stevie Nicks has characterized as "very private, very much to herself." She shakes her head, as if she's been talking too much. "I can't believe I'm remembering all these things." But, she continues, "I went to see Fleetwood Mac one night. John didn't have his girlfriend . . . He asked me if I wanted to have a drink and we sat down, had a few laughs, then they had to go onstage. All the time I was kind of eyeballing ol' Greenie. After the concert was over, John came over and said, 'Shall I take you out to dinner sometime?' I went, 'Whoa . . . I thought you were engaged or something.' He said, 'Nah, 'sail over.' I thought he was devastatingly attractive but it had never occurred to me to look at him."

They went out for a time, then John McVie disappeared overseas for Fleetwood Mac's first American tour. "By this time I was really, really crazy about him," Christine recalls, "but I didn't know what was happening with him. Chicken Shack did a ten-day stint at the Blow-Up Club in Munich and I had this strange relationship with a crazy German DJ who wanted to whisk me off and marry me. I turned him down . . . and wrote John a big letter."

Fleetwood Mac returned from America and McVie proposed. They were married ten days later, mostly to please Christine's dying mother. But John and Christine didn't see much of each other. Both bands toured often and when she left Chicken Shack, she tried a disastrously unprepared solo tour and LP. Christine gladly retired to be John McVie's old lady.

"I thought it was extremely romantic," she says. "Obviously a little bit of the glamour of what Fleetwood Mac was in those days rubbed off. It was almost like someone marrying a Beatle. You married one of the links in the chain and you were part of them.

"We were very happy. Very happy for probably three years and then the strain of me being in the same band as him started to take its toll. When you're in the same band as somebody, you're seeing them almost more than 24 hours a day. You start to see an awful lot of the bad side 'cause touring is no easy thing. There's a lot of drinking . . . John is not the most pleasant of people when he's drunk. Very belligerent. I was seeing more Hyde than Jekyll."

Peter Green, in a sudden plea for Christ, left the band in late '70, and Christine McVie came out of her retirement, adding keyboards to the band. Green's departure, says Christine, "was an out-of-the-blue shock to everybody. Peter had been quite happy and was starting to write this really incredible music like 'Green Manalishi.' It was like he was being lifted. He'd wrung the blues dry and already played 50 times better than most of the black guitarists."

In the midst of a German tour during the group's first peak of popularity, Green fell in with some people Christine remembers as "jet-setters." The band had recorded a Green composition, "Black Magic Woman," and, ironically, the group he ran into were reportedly into black magic and the occult. They turned him on to acid. He left Fleetwood Mac on that same tour.

"Something snapped in him," Christine says, looking saddened. "He dropped this fatal tab of acid and withdrew. He still has this amazing power, but it's negative. You don't want him around. We've all cried a lot of tears over Peter. We've all spent so much time and energy talking him into more positive channels. He'll just sit there and laugh. 'Fuck it . . .'"

Not long ago, exasperated at being asked the perennial reunion question, Mick Fleetwood told an interviewer that sure, someday, maybe on an English tour, the original Fleetwood Mac might get onstage one night.

Later, when the band arrived in London, Peter Green was waiting for them in the lobby of their hotel. Unannounced. Christine didn't recognize the flabby, slept-in figure carrying a disco-droning cassette machine. "I heard this voice say, 'Hullo Chris.' I turned around and see this rotund little guy with a big beer gut and pint in his hand. I couldn't believe it. I said, 'Aren't you embarrassed?' 'Naw,' he says, 'fuck it, what the hell.' We gave him a room at the hotel for a few nights. He'd knock on your door, come in and just sit there on your bed. He wouldn't volunteer anything."

Jeremy Spencer left Fleetwood Mac a year after Peter Green under vaguely similar circumstances. He stepped onto a Children of God bus in Hollywood and never returned. The writer met Spencer recently on a London street, blank-eyed and selling Children of God books. His pitch: "I used to be in a group called Fleetwood Mac until I found . . ."

Christine meticulously recollects the details of all the ensuing clock-in/clock-out personnel changes during Fleetwood Mac's lean years between their Future Games and Fleetwood Mac LPs. But she places particular emphasis only on Bob Welch. "I have so much love for Bob," she says. "He is such a big part of this band. I don't really get off on what he's doing in Paris [Welch's current band]. When he quit, he was getting into a real feel of the kind of guitar playing that Peter used to have and Lindsey definitely has got a lot of. It's a very nebulous quality, very difficult to explain. It's a question of what note not to play."

Photos: Fleetwood Mac Through the Years

Welch's last LP with the group was Heroes Are Hard to Find, their first as a transplanted L.A. band. After breaking up with their manager they had moved to Los Angeles to start all over. The McVies lived in a small three-room apartment in Malibu. It was there, on a portable Hohner piano in the bedroom, that she wrote "Over My Head" and "Say You Love Me."

"I don't struggle over my songs," she offers. "I write them quickly and I've never written a lot. I write what is required of me. For me, people like Joni Mitchell are making too much of a statement. I don't really write about myself, which puts me in a safe little cocoon . . . . I'm a pretty basic love song writer."

Christine shrugs off the suddenly massive acceptance of Fleetwood Mac as "a lot of rewards for a lot of hard work." And it wasn't the flush of super-stardom, she stresses, that caused her to split with John McVie. She explains compassionately: "I broke up with John in the middle of a tour. I was aware of it being rather irresponsible. I had to do it for my sanity. It was either that or me ending up in a lunatic asylum.

"I still worry for him more than I would ever dare tell him. I still have a lot of love for John. Let's face it, as far as I'm concerned, it was him that stopped me loving him. He constantly tested what limits of endurance I would go to. He just went one step too far. If he knew that I cared and worried so much about him, I think he'd play on it.

"There's no doubt about the fact that he hasn't really been a very happy man since I left him. I know that. Sure, I could make him happy tomorrow and say, 'Yeah, John, I'll come back to you.' Then I would be miserable. I'm not that unselfish."

Then there were the Sausalito sessions. "Trauma," Christine groans. "Trau-ma. The sessions were like a cocktail party every night – people everywhere. We ended up staying in these weird hospital rooms . . . and of course John and me were not exactly the best of friends. Stevie and I spent a lot of time together. She was going through a bit of a hard time too because she was the one that axed it. Lindsey was pretty down about it for a while, then he just woke up one morning and said, 'Fuck this, I don't want to be unhappy,' and started getting some girlfriends together. Then Stevie couldn't handle it . . ."

Almost immediately Christine McVie entered into a romance with Curry Grant, Fleetwood Mac's strapping lighting director. They lived together for a year in Christine's home, above Sunset Strip. "I haven't been without a man in my life for . . . God, it must be about 12 years. I can't imagine what it's like not to have an old man . . . but I have no intention of getting married. I don't think I'm in love . . ." She considers that for a few seconds. "I don't really know what the hell love is." Then, she suddenly adds, "I'm proud of having been John's wife." She still wears McVie's ring, but on another finger. "Maybe we don't feel the same about each other anymore, but I wouldn't like to wipe that off the board.

"John can't handle Curry too well, even though he's much more at ease with other women around me than I am with men in front of him. He's making an effort. But if I was the kind of girl who wandered in with a new boyfriend every week, enjoying my newfound freedom, I don't know how he could handle that."

Isn't she tempted to play the field?

"It would be a new experience," she says shyly, growing amused at the thought. "Sure, you know." She leans toward a telephone. "Kenny Loggins! Call me up. I'd love to have a load of dates. I haven't done that since I was at college. But it's really out of the question. I mean I hardly meet anybody. I'm so involved in the band."

Christine McVie's eyes light up with a revelation. "Seven more years until I'm 40. Then I'll start all over again . . ."

John McVie stares silently out across a windy Marina Del Rey, a half-hour away from Hollywood. "Too choppy today," he mumbles. "We shouldn't take the boat out." Having had this 41-foot schooner a year now, he is brisk and expert at tidying it up, taking down the sail and draining out side compartments before we find seats outside, on the stern, to talk.

For years, McVie dreamt about buying a boat. With the success of Fleetwood Mac, he was able to get one of the best. And when Christine asked for a separation, he moved on board, storing away everything but some sailing books, a radio, a television set and numerous statuettes of penguins.

McVie, who is 30, claims that he's "much more comfortable here than in a house anyway." But he seems oddly unhappy. He is a solemn man. If he is pleased with realizing one of his fantasies, his poker face doesn't show it.

One wonders what success has meant to him.

"This," he says quietly, knocking the stern of the boat, "the freedom to be here, rather than slogging your heart out in Hollywood. But this isn't . . . would you say this is a luxury? If there was a house with it, I'd say so. But this is half the price of a house."

John McVie, the Mac in Fleetwood Mac, started the band with Mick Fleetwood, Jeremy Spencer and Peter Green in '67. Before that he was a four-year charter member of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. He has seen Fleetwood Mac through the complete musical spectrum – six guitarists, three label changes, innumerable tours, every album and many, many times more bad than good.

If Fleetwood Mac had been a mediocre-selling album for the band, there would have been no desperation breakup. If Buckingham or Nicks hadn't worked out, McVie would have dutifully helped find replacements. He's a strange creature to rock & roll: a patient man.

"Fleetwood Mac was doing fine before that album," he figures. "People are always asking me, 'How does it feel to have made it?' If that's the case, what do I do now? Now that I've 'made it'? I hate that phrase." For once, his voice is audible above the din of the marina.

"I didn't anticipate all the commotion around the last album," he says. "Not as much as 4 million sales. There's a lot of good albums we've done. It's just one of those things – the right album at the right time. But that's the criteria of making it in this business: a big album. Then you get your own TV show, you go make a movie. It's not important. Being seen wearing a Gucci suit . . . that syndrome is so sad."

So what's the motivation to be around it for more than 14 years?

"Playing bass," comes the ready reply. "I'm not a dedicated musician particularly, but it's the one thing I enjoy doing."

Would he soon consider retiring?

"What would I do? Sit on the boat, but that would get as boring as sitting around the studio . . ."

One cautiously broaches the subject of his split with Christine. It must have been a major turning point . . .

"Yeah," McVie agrees. "It still affects me. I'm still adjusting to the fact that it's not John and Chris anymore. It goes up and down."

Feeling suddenly awkward, McVie stops and assembles a statement explaining himself. "It's difficult to tell someone, 'Yeah, I'm this kind of person . . . 'The quiet thing is fine," he says softly. "If I had anything that I thought was world-shaking or profound, I'd say something. I really can't come up with anything on politics, state of society, the relation of music to society . . . it's just horseshit. I play bass."

McVie sounds like his soft-spoken fellow member from the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton, in both philosophy and personality. (Christine McVie: "Those two? They're like two peas out of the same pod.")

Clapton has said he finds his personality by drinking . . .

"I drink too much, period," McVie bristles, "but when I've drunk too much, a personality comes out. It's not very pleasant to be around."

In the end, John McVie is a droll, likable gentleman with a sullen aura. Used to touring and recording with his wife and band, he is suddenly alone on his boat.

"He'll cheer up," an associate of the band says with a laugh. "He always does. Everyone's attitude is just to leave him to himself. They know there's only one thing that could bring him around instantly: an affair with Linda Ronstadt."

McVie wistfully admits to this crush. Last year, suspiciously soon after learning that Fleetwood Mac would be on the Rock Music Awards show with Ronstadt as a fellow nominee, he bought an exquisitely tailored burgundy velvet, three-piece outfit. He wore it that night, and Fleetwood Mac won Rock Group of the Year, among other honors.

Ronstadt never showed up.

Mick Fleetwood's the tall (6'6"), menacing-looking one who is, for all purposes, the manager of the band.

When former manager Clifford Davis burned his bridges by sending out a bogus band with the same name, Fleetwood Mac was too broke to find another. Decisions fell directly to Fleetwood and McVie, the original members and owners of the name. McVie held no ambitions as a businessman, but Fleetwood became obsessed with the music business. He grew to love the new responsibility of managing himself. Fleetwood retained a lawyer, Michael "Mickey" Shapiro, and together they guide the band's career.

Fleetwood is surely in his element this morning. We're sitting in the executive conference room at the tip of a private Warners jet returning to L.A. from a last-minute Fleetwood Mac benefit in Indiana for Birch Bayh.

"Everything has taken a very natural course," he reflects pleasantly. "We've never made records with the attitude of making hits. With us, it's potluck. The fact that they are is great.

"That's not just from the present lineup of the band, that's going back years and years. Like when Peter wrote 'Albatross' [Fleetwood Mac's first successful single in England]. Everyone thought it was a concerted effort. It was a complete accident that it was a hit. The BBC used it for some wildlife program and then someone put it on Top of the Pops and it was a hit. If Rumours was a radical failure, I'm sure we'd all be disturbed, but we wouldn't feel disillusioned."

Mick Fleetwood, like John McVie, cannot think of a time when he was ever frustrated with the band's stalled sales figures. After ten years, they value Fleetwood Mac more as a way of life than as a business investment. Success was a pleasant surprise. "You go to the office every day and you don't think about it in the end, you just go," Fleetwood explains. "That's what we were doing. Being part of Fleetwood Mac, playing through the ups and downs."

Fleetwood is resolute: "I could have never planned any of this. I don't even believe in making plans. They only create an atmosphere of disappointment. So it's not a day-to-day situation with us, but there's always full potential of either great things happening or totally disastrous things happening. That is very important to me personally . . . Fleetwood Mac, from point one, has been like that. We'll always be able to move without breaking a leg . . ."

I definitely want to have a baby in the next four years. For sure, I want to have one or two children and I don't want to wait any further than, say, 34. This is all part of my plan. By that time I hope that I'll be living up in the mountains somewhere with a very pretty house and a piano and a tape recorder, just writing, and then going to New York every once in a while to shop. I love that too, but I mostly just like to be in a really warm place with a bunch of animals, dogs and cats."

It's a long way from Peter Green.

Twenty-eight-year-old Stephanie "Stevie" Nicks is an endearing blend of beatnik poet and sassy rock & roller. One thing for sure: success does not faze her. She has, in fact, lived around it much of her life. Until heart surgery forced him into early retirement two years ago, her father, Jeff Nicks, was simultaneously executive vice-president of Greyhound and president of Armour Meats. Stevie, the only girl, was "the star in my family's sky."

Born in Phoenix and raised along her father's corporate climb in Los Angeles, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and finally San Francisco, she nearly graduated from San Jose State with a degree in speech communication. Instead, she quit a few months early to go on the road in 1968 with an acid-rock band called Fritz.

"That did not amuse my parents too much," Stevie notes wryly. Just out of the shower and toweling off her mousy-brown-flecked-with-green-tint hair on an antique couch in her Hollywood Hills duplex, she makes easy conversation. "They wanted me to do what I wanted to do. They were just worried I was going to get down to 80 pounds and be a miserable, burnt out 27-year-old."

Despite a senior citizen's penchant for detailing her various aches and pains – she's always got a sore throat or a cold – the one thing Stevie Nicks does not exude is weakness.

Through the three-and-a-half-year existence of Fritz, her all-male band members made a private agreement: hands off Stevie. That included Lindsey Buckingham, the slender, curly-haired bass player with whom she shared lead vocals.

"I think there was always something between me and Lindsey, but nobody in that band really wanted me as their girlfriend because I was just too ambitious for them. But they didn't want anybody else to have me either. If anybody in the band started spending any time with me, the other three would literally pick that person apart. To the death.

"They all thought I was in it for the attention. These guys didn't take me seriously at all. I was just a girl singer, and they hated the fact that I got a lot of credit."

Nicks flouts the memory, laughing with defiance. "They would kill themselves practicing for ten hours, and people would call up and say: 'We want to book that band with the little brownish-blondish-haired girl.' There was always just really weird things going on between us." Now she is charged up and scoots to the edge of her sofa to make her point: "I could never figure out why I stayed in that band. Now I know that was the preparation for Fleetwood Mac."

But it would be another two years between the inevitable breakup of Fritz and an invitation to join Fleetwood Mac. Stevie and Lindsey chose to stay together as a duo, calling themselves Buckingham Nicks. "We started spending a lot of time together working out songs. Pretty soon we started spending all our time together and . . . it just happened."

They moved down to L.A., started knocking on doors, and eventually signed a contract with Polydor Records. They released an album and toured to good audience reaction. The band even developed a cult following in Birmingham, Alabama.

In New York, however, Polydor was not impressed and dropped them before they could finish a second album. Lindsey resorted to a phone-soliciting job. Stevie became a $1.50-an-hour waitress in a Beverly Hills singles restaurant.

Waiting on tables? What about mom and dad?

"I'd get money from them here and there," says Stevie, "but if I wanted to go back to school, if I wanted to move back home, then they would support me . . . . If I was gonna be here in L.A. doing my trip, I was gonna have to do it on my own."

They auditioned for Russ Regan, head of 20th Century Records, who, Buckingham recalls, "thought we were a smash act but couldn't sign us" and Ode Records president and artists' manager Lou Adler, who listened to half of one song and thanked them very much. Another manager recommended they learn the Top 40 and play steak and lobster houses.

When she visited home just seven months before joining Fleetwood Mac, her father was also discouraging. "He saw me getting skinnier and skinnier and I wasn't very happy. He said, 'I think you better start setting some time limits here.' They saw, I really think, shades of my grandfather A.J. [Aaron Jeff Nicks]. He was a country & western singer and he drank way too much. He was unhappy, trying to make it. He wanted to make it very badly. He turned into a very embittered person and he died that way."

In late 1974, Keith Olsen, engineer on the Buckingham Nicks LP, met with Mick Fleetwood. Olsen, pitching himself and his studio for the Fleetwood Mac account, presented Stevie and Lindsey's demo as his studio portfolio. Fleetwood listened to the album and made a mental note. When Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac six weeks later, he looked up Stevie and Lindsey.

They went up to Mick Fleetwood's house in Laurel Canyon to talk. Buckingham offered to do an audition, but Fleetwood declined. Instead, he simply asked: "Want to join?" The two looked at each other and said, "Yes."

"John and Mick," Buckingham says, "have always been open to having a lot of different people in the band – which is odd. I would never be able to do that. I would think it was real important to keep an identity. I remember being a kid – if a new member joined a group, I just didn't like that at all. But that openness is what's kept them going for so long."

But he and Nicks had one more commitment: a headlining concert in Birmingham. The show drew a screaming sellout crowd of more than 6000 fans who knew all the words to their songs. "We went out in style," says Buckingham.

Fleetwood Mac went directly into the studio, reworking such Buckingham Nicks material as "Monday Morning," "Landslide" and a new song written originally on acoustic piano about a Welsh witch Stevie had read about named "Rhiannon." "Everything was already worked out," says Buckingham. He plucked up a belly-backed acoustic guitar and played the introduction to "Rhiannon." "Everything."

The newest members of the band were happy with the album, but Stevie Nicks went through an anxious period of self-doubt. She can quote entire passages from a review in Rolling Stone that, she says, almost caused her to quit. "They said my singing was 'callow' and that really hurt my feelings." She began to think that maybe she wasn't that good, and that she had been asked into the band only because she was with Buckingham. "Time after time I would read:' . . . the raucous voice of Stevie Nicks and the golden-throated voice of Christine McVie, who's the only saving grace of the band.' When it comes to competition, I won't compete for a man and I won't compete for a place on that stage either. If I'm not wanted, I'll get out. I was bummed."

But the bum didn't last long: Fleetwood Mac immediately became a gold album and Christine's ethereal song, "Over My Head," broke big in both pop and easy-listening radio. Nicks, who'd done harmonies on the track, felt better. And when "Rhiannon" found an even bigger audience, with its mainstream rock & roll getting both AM and FM airplay, she forgot all about quitting.

She also became Rhiannon, a witch in Welsh mythology. "I see her as a good witch," Stevie says. "Very positive. I sink into that whole trip when I'm onstage." With her diaphanous black outfits, her chiffon and lace, and a graceful way around the stage, she just as quickly became the band's first willing star/focal point.

There was, of course, a price for all this. Last year, during the ill-fated stretch in Sausalito, she separated from Buckingham after over six years.

"The best explanation is: try working with your secretary . . . in a raucous office . . . and then come home with her at night. See how long you could stand her. I could be no comfort to Lindsey when he needed comfort."

She cites an example from Sausalito. Lindsey was feeling depressed because he couldn't quite get some guitar parts down right. "So we'd go back to where we were staying and he would really need comfort from me, for me to say, 'It's all right. Who cares about them?' You know, be an old lady."

One problem. "I was also pissed off because he hadn't gotten the guitar part on. So I'm trying to defend their point of view and at the same time trying to make him feel better. It doesn't work. I couldn't be all those things."

Stevie has kept mostly to herself since the break up with Lindsey. Outside of a short romance with drummer/singer Don Henley of the Eagles, she's spent her days either in the studio or at home writing and taping her songs. She icily denies talk of an affair with Paul Kantner.

"It's strange for me," she says in confidential tones. "I've never been a dater. I don't really like parties. I'm very alone now. I'm not one of those women who are just willing to go out and sit at the Rainbow. In my position I could meet a lot of people just because of the band I'm in. Well, I don't want to meet anybody because of the band I'm in."

Stevie doesn't mind airing her personal life like this at all. "I don't care that everybody knows me and Chris and John and Lindsey and Mick all broke up," she declares. "Because we did. So that's fact. I just don't want people to pick up a magazine and go, 'Oh, another interview from Fleetwood Mac.' If it's interesting, I'm not opposed to giving out information.

"On this album, all the songs that I wrote except maybe 'Gold Dust Woman' – and even that comes into it – are definitely about the people in the band . . . . Chris' relationships, John's relationship, Mick's relationship, Lindsey's and mine. They're all there and they're very honest and people will know exactly what I'm talking about . . . people will really enjoy listening to what happened since the last album."

The sun sets in Hollywood and Stevie lets her house darken along with it. "I'll tell you an interesting thing that hit me after the Rock Awards," she says. "We won the Best Group and the Best Album awards – that was very far out and everybody was really, really blissed out over that and we went to some party at the Hilton or something afterward and just stayed about 30 minutes. My brother Chris and I got in our limousine and came home. And it really struck me, driving home in the back seat of a black limousine. I was so lonely.

"I thought, 'Here I am, we just won these fantastic awards, we've just been on TV, everybody is singing our praises and here I am driving home in my black limousine.' Terribly alone. Sort of knowing how it would feel to be Marilyn Monroe or something. It was a very strange feeling and I didn't like it at all."

Stevie Nicks opens her eyes very wide. "It scared me."

Lindsey Buckingham is no doubt the first member of Fleetwood Mac to list Brian Wilson as a major inspiration. Lindsey's California influence on the band is legitimate too. Born and raised in Palo Alto, Buckingham was "another jock in a family of swimming jocks." His brother Greg won a silver medal in the '68 Olympics. Late in high school Lindsey drifted into a rock & roll band and was sufficiently smitten to spoil family tradition. He quit the water polo team. "My coach went insane," Lindsey says. "He started screaming, 'You're nothing. You'll always be a nothing.'"

And he was nothing for a while, when that band went psychedelic and became Fritz. Buckingham couldn't master mind-blowing lead guitar and was put on bass for the next three and a half years. "I was just a young kid who thought it was really neat that we were in a band," he says. Then he teamed up with Nicks, and finally they joined Fleetwood.

Now, Buckingham lopes into the house of a mutual friend, looking a little dazed. Listening to the radio on the way over he'd finally heard himself singing the just released single, "Go Your Own Way." "It sounded real weird," he shrugs. "I just want it to be so good that I get paranoid. I have to relax, get this whole time behind us . . ."

Ten months devoted to Fleetwood Mac's album has left Buckingham spindly and studio wan. He gives a rundown of how a group can spend so long taping 45 minutes of music: "There's one track on the album that started out as one song in Sausalito. We decided it needed a bridge, so we cut a bridge and edited it into the rest of the song. We didn't get a vocal and left it for a long time in a bunch of pieces. It almost went off the album. Then we listened back and decided we liked the bridge, but didn't like the rest of the song. So I wrote verses for that bridge, which was originally not in the song and edited those in. We saved the ending. The ending was the only thing left from the original track. We ended up calling it 'The Chain' because it was a bunch of pieces."

His face lights up as he realizes that it's all behind him now. "I feel really lucky that I've had the opportunity to go through some of the heartaches and shit we've been through the past year. It's had a profound effect on me. I feel a lot older, I feel like I've learned a whole lot by taking on a large responsibility slightly unaided." Buckingham laughs to himself. "Being in this band," he says, "really fucks up relationships with chicks. Since Stevie, I have found that to be true. I could meet someone that I really like, have maybe a few days to get it together and that's about it. The rest of the time I'm too into Fleetwood Mac."

Buckingham has overcome the breakup with Nicks. "It was a little lonely there for a while," he admits. "The thought of being on my own really terrified me. But then I realized being alone is really a cleansing thing . . . as I began to feel myself becoming more myself again. I'm surprised we lasted as long as we did."

Buckingham doesn't object to the confessional tone of Rumours either. "I'm not ashamed of my personal life," he proclaims. "Just 'cause you're in the public eye doesn't mean you don't go through the same bullshit."

Lindsey Buckingham sets down the guitar. "Tonight I just want to go get drunk," he announces. "I know the exact place too. They let me throw the food . . ."

The two doormen at Kowloon's Chinese restaurant greet Buckingham and his party warmly. They know him as the young gentleman who leaves a big mess and a bigger tip.

"Do you know who he is?" one doorman asks the other.

The other doorman nods casually. "He's an actor or something. I think he plays in a soap opera . . ."


Los Angeles — Peter Frampton eased himself gently onto his bed in his luxurious bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel. He'd spent a week there, venturing outside only to do his last concerts of 1976 — four sold-out nights at the 18,000-seat Forum in Inglewood.

"Howard Hughes used to stay here," Frampton informed. He was immediately apologetic: "I don't know if I'm quite comfortable in all of this," he said. "It's still real new to me."

About one year new, in fact. Frampton, 26, began his career at 16 with the Herd, a much-screamed-after British pop band of the late Sixties. The group broke up, penniless, in 1969. Frampton and Steve Marriott of the Small Faces then formed Humble Pie. Frampton lasted through the band's third U.S. album, Rockin' the Fillmore. He tried his hand as a session guitarist (on Son of Schmillson and All Things Must Pass) and then as a solo artist. Frampton always consoled himself with the knowledge that, should he bomb on his own, he could always return to session work. He considered that a very real possibility right up until the January 1976 release of Frampton Comes Alive!

Within a month, the LP was in the Top Ten. In March it hit Number One for a week. The next three months, Frampton Comes Alive! lingered in the Top Five, making room for The Eagles' Greatest Hits, Presence, Black and Blue and Wings at the Speed of Sound, until June, when it seized Number One again and refused to budge throughout the summer and early fall. He became the top attraction of the highly competitive Bicentennial summer. Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life finally dethroned Frampton Comes Alive! in late November, after a record 17 weeks at the top. Frampton's album has sold 7 million copies in America and another 3 million worldwide; in the same period, Frampton sold nearly 2 million concert tickets. At a royalty rate of "approximately" 67¢ per album (according to A&M Records), this makes for a prodigious one-year income. People magazine captioned a photo of Frampton with:"… His GNP? 50 million." The figure upset Frampton: "I'd like the people to know that figure is nowhere near what was actually earned," he said. "A lot of people came up to me and said, 'Do you really have that much money?' And I have to say, 'No, not on me, no.' They don't realize that Gross National Product is income generated in the music business, in the photography business, with posters, the T-shirt business… for other people, including myself.

"I don't really realize how much there is," said Frampton. "I don't phone up every five minutes and say, 'How much have we got now?' I don't want to know." In afterthought, he added: "It's a staggering amount, unfortunately…."

Along with the money came the accolades. Everybody loves a winner. Frampton was named "Rock Personality of the Year" by Billboard last June and on the Rock Music Awards in September; he's "Artist of the Year" in Rolling Stone's Music Poll. At last year's end he signed to star in Robert Stigwood's film of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

"I will remember this year as like… well, it meant relief in a way," said Frampton. "But only inasmuch as I can pay my bills. I try not to think about it. I pile up the press clippings and send them off to my mother. She's got a scrapbook going back to when I was, like, eight years old. It's just starting to sink in, what's happening. The longer it takes to really sink in, the better."

I have a clear memory of Peter Frampton from the winter of 1975: a pale, thin, childlike figure in wrinkled green satin pants, hunched over a mixing board at A&M Studios in Hollywood listening to the live recording of a 17-minute song he had played practically every night since early '73 — "Do You Feel like We Do?" Frampton was grinning. I asked him why.

"Listen to them!" He was replaying the sounds of an adoring audience up so loud that they challenged the other instruments. Which was exactly the idea. "They are as much a part of this record as anybody," he said.

The album had gone through a myriad of changes, coming right down to the wire. First it was to be a single album, all rock & roll and recorded at Winterland Auditorium in San Francisco. Then came the decision to include acoustic material. After a listening session at which A&M president Jerry Moss quipped, "Now can we hear the other album?," Frampton Comes Alive! became a two-record set. A remote recording truck was dispatched at the last minute to tape Frampton shows in Long Island and Plattsburg, New York.

Ten days later he was back in the A&M studios, checking the final mixes and listening to Frampton Comes Alive! in its entirety for the first time. When the last side had finished, Frampton was not particularly euphoric. He was tired, eager to just get it out. I wished him luck. He said — what else — that he needed it.

One year later, to the week, we sat in his Beverly Hills bungalow and tried to talk of something other than success. It was impossible. I wondered just how much longer, amidst the inevitable pressures, he could continue being what he has long been considered: a low-key, untroubled Nice Guy.

Frampton's face crumbled into melancholy. "I remember when I was in England, living with my parents, and I used to see a movie star in a car or something and I'd think, 'Wow, I actually saw him.' You've got to be 'on duty' most all the time, for the fans. But instead of me becoming harder…" He chose his words carefully. "It's an awful thing to say, but I suppose people around me make it harder for people that they know are gonna upset me to get to me…

"The real shame is to see other people that you've known for a long time change, when you haven't. I love to be a hermit. It all comes with working. When I'm off I either go to Mexico with my friends or just stay at home. I love TV. I love staying at home and not seeing a guitar for ten days… but then I love that feeling of picking it up again. The more simple my life is, the happier I am."

Onstage, Peter Frampton's Pollyanna-ish personality turns to intense ecstasy. The mere flashing of his cover-boy grin seems to ignite mass partying. It's infectious merriment, even if some critical circles see shades of a rock & roll John Denver. "It's all very natural," Frampton said. "We have a good time onstage, 'cause we realize it gets through to the audience. Gone is the age of doing a 72-bar guitar solo with your back to the audience, wearing a ripped pair of Levi's. They want to be entertained. And when I'm applauded for doing that, all it makes me want to do is entertain more."

It will be a long time, Frampton swears, before he retires the Comes Alive! material. Even the unavoidable reality of performing his climactic marathon, "Do You Feel," for years to come does not rattle him. "I think if I'd written 'Layla,' I would still be doing it," he said. "Eric Clapton may have stopped doing it, but I would never. The actual music doesn't change so much anymore, but the audience reaction does. It's unbelievable. It brings new things out of me every night. That's why I never get bored."

Indeed, it's doubtful Frampton will have the time to even consider the concept of boredom. Foremost on his schedule is writing and recording his first studio album in two years. Then comes the filming of Sgt. Pepper in early summer. A soundtrack album featuring Frampton interpretations of six as-yet-undecided Beatles songs will coincide with the movie's Christmas 1977 release.

Frampton is trying very hard not to fret over pulling it all of. "Penny [girlfriend Penny McCall] and I have this saying: 'There is no tomorrow until tonight's gig is over with,'" he said. "When there's something on my mind, and right now it's the album, till that's over with, there is no future."

The album will be titled I'm in You. Frampton originally intended to record it at the same Motown studios in Detroit where his hero Stevie Wonder recorded all his early hits. "Before I even had a chance to ask Motown, it got out in some magazine. They rang up and asked Motown if it was true and Motown said, 'No, no, we never allow anybody.' I never got a chance to ask myself. I felt bad about that.

"Now I'm not sure where I'll be doing it, probably in my new house [in upstate New York]. Wherever we are, that's where we'll do the album. I hope it works out so I can do it in a house rather than in a studio."

I'm in You, according to Frampton, will be released by Easter. "Every album has taken six weeks in total recording time. Then you've got to allow a couple of months to get the cover and everything ready." He clutched his throat. "It's gotta be bloody good." Then there's Sgt. Pepper. "I've always wanted to do a movie," he said, "and it's such a great thing to be involved in, especially after meeting all the people that are behind it. It's Chris Bearde's first film" — Bearde, who will be the director, is from television: The Gong Show and Sonny and Cher are among his credits — "and Henry Edwards' first script" — Edwards being the New York-based rock writer. "First everything except for Robert Stigwood, who's very experienced." (Stigwood was behind, among other projects, the film of Jesus Christ Superstar!)

The film will be a trying experience, Frampton conceded, but it will also be "a labor of love" for a longtime Beatles fanatic. Frampton vividly recalled his first encounter with the album Sgt. Pepper: "I remember buying it in Petticoat Lane, at this store that used to sell records two weeks before they came out. They'd knock off a load on the way to the ship… and I got Sgt. Pepper ten days before it came out. I still have the original mono copy at home."

Frampton detailed the film: "It's going to be all music; there's going to be some dialogue, storytelling, but I don't say any. When the songs are playing, it's going to be like Tommy, which I liked very much, but it's going to be a lot more of a comedy."

According to Henry Edwards, Frampton "will play a real hero in the film, an athletic one — he'll sing, act, dance and do his best to save his girl from the clutches of Mean Mr. Mustard. He plays Billy Shears, a young and handsome guitar player in a small-town American band. Why an American band? We want to create a movie that's a movie, not a Beatles film. It's even set in the present, not the Sixties."

Most of the casting is still up in the air. The Bee Gees, as "three wise men," will narrate the story. There are two female leads — Shears' girlfriend, named Strawberry Fields, and Lucy. Olivia Newton-John and Donna Summer have been mentioned as possibilities.

Frampton doesn't believe that playing opposite pop stars will dilute his following. "I should think that it would only broaden my following," he said. "Besides, I'll be playing with the same band from the live album…"

When the subject turned to money, and how Frampton is protecting his new fortune, I watched a perfectly easy and exuberant face overtaken by the taut expression of someone about to be pushed out of an airplane.

"Uh . . . I'm still taking advice," he said hesitatingly. "I don't know . . . the more you have, the more of a problem it is. I'm paying more taxes. And putting it away for taxes. I bought two houses. Apart from that, the money is taken care of, but only because I've had enough time to have the right people looking after it.

"The money thing is very, very touchy. I don't like talking about it because I don't think about it. Like I said, all I want to do is be able to pay my bills. What doesn't go on expenses I'm going to put away and everybody around me is going to have a good time. That's all I want."

That's about all that's left. It's not that easy reaching your loftiest goals by age 26. Not long ago, Frampton nearly hit circuit overload when he won the Rock Music Award on CBS-TV as "Rock Personality of the Year." The presenter of the award was Stevie Wonder.

"My knees shook all the way to the podium," Frampton recounted. "Do you know how long that walk was? I was putting my guitar down from playing 'Baby, I Love Your Way' when one of the ushers said, 'Well, you're not needed anymore, sir, could you please go back to the dressing room?' And I said, 'I hate to seem forward at all, but I am nominated in this category.' So I said to the band, 'Sorry, fellows, but I don't think we've got it. When someone tells you to go back to the dressing room…'

"I went up to Stevie Wonder afterwards and said, 'It's been a pleasure to meet you. It's been a long time since I started listening to you. Maybe it would be nice to get together and play one day.' And he said, 'Yeah, great.' As I was walking away, he said, 'You don't play a bad bag yourself.' And I said, 'Well, you know who I learned from, don't you?' He went, 'Yeah, I know.' It was just lovely."

Everybody knows someone like Peter Frampton — humble and careful, vulnerable, constantly appealing directly to one's protective instincts. But Frampton hardly needs help.

"I'm very, very lucky that I had this much experience," he said. "The ten-years before this and the five semiprofessional years before that. That experience of being in bands and around people and learning what not to get hung up on — that's really the thing."

There was a hint of finality to his observation. Then he slipped off his bed to stretch…and something familiar registered. He was wearing those same old green satin pants. Wrinkled again.


os Angeles — "Miss Ronstadt's line is busy. You'll have to wait. I gotta check you." The beefy guard at the front gate of Malibu Colony waits and dials again. Still busy.

Twenty minutes later, the guard gives up and waves me through. "You could be here all day," he cracks mirthlessly "But listen ... if I don't hear from her within five minutes" ... he pauses for effect ... "you'll meet the sheriffs. You don't want to meet the sheriffs."

The Colony. A tract of roomy beach houses strung along the Pacific 25 miles north of Los Angeles. Considering the surroundings, it's not surprising that Malibu has almost always been inhabited by artists, though the enormous cost of year-round, triple-security living makes it a select few at that.

The Band built their studio here. Dylan, Neil Diamond and Eric Clapton recorded here. Neil Young named Zuma after the Malibu community where he lives. Joni Mitchell refers to it in "Trouble Child" ... and Linda Ronstadt posed for the softly erotic cover of Hasten Down the Wind just outside her picture window.

I pull up in front of her wooden gate and push the intercom button. A frenzied voice blurts, "Uh ... hold on ... c'mon in ..." and the gate buzzes open.

A minute later Linda Ronstadt, who turned 30 last July, bounds down from her upstairs bedroom. Hair mussed and still in a nightshirt, she rubs the sleep from her eyes. It's one in the afternoon. "I've been on the phone all morning," she says. "Let me make some coffee." I almost forget to explain about the sheriffs.

Her eyes widen as she listens to the story. "That guard said that?" she asks incredulously. "What a jerk. I better call." After inviting me to look around, Linda scampers back to the phone.

Her split-level home, which she purchased for almost $200,000, dominated by the Pacific Ocean and beach only a few yards below, is roomy, with wood floors, plenty of windows and virtually no furniture besides a piano, stereo and blue paisley couch. Linda has lived here alone for the past nine months, and repeatedly apologizes for the lack of furnishings.

"I'm learning to live by myself ... and I love it," she says a few minutes later, curled up on the sun deck sofa. "I lived alone for two months once, in an apartment, but I've always either been on the road or shacked up with one guy or another or living in some kind of hell." She leans back into a stream of bright sunlight. "I've gone a long time now without falling in love and without having that neurotic tendency to define my existence."

The overwhelming popularity of Linda Ronstadt has caught more than a few people by surprise. For six years and four albums she was regarded as no more than a barefoot, braless, pleasant-sounding country-ballad singer. Then, suddenly, she cut "You're No Good," a mainstream pop effort stronger and more confident than anything she'd ever recorded. Her 1974 album, Heart Like a Wheel, shot past Led Zeppelin and Elton John to the top of the charts. Her next two albums, Prisoner in Disguise and Hasten Down the Wind, have also been million-sellers, helped along by singles like "When Will I Be Loved," "I Can't Help It if I'm Still in Love with You," then "Heatwave" and "That'll Be the Day." Now, just two years after "You're No Good," Elektra/Asylum has compiled Linda Ronstadt's Greatest Hits for Christmas release.

"When Heart Like a Wheel went to Number One," says Linda, "I just walked around apologizing every single day. I could see that my supposed friends resented me. I went around going, 'I'm not that good of a singer...' And I got so self-conscious that when I went onstage, I couldn't sing at all. It almost made me go crazy ... I mean I needed a lot of help, you know."

Although she rarely looks me in the eye, focusing instead on couples and dog walkers on the beach, Linda's confessions begin to flow easily. Almost as if I were her analyst.

"I found a psychiatrist," she continues, "who really put me on the right track. He got me through all those little obstacles. If it wasn't for him, I probably would have quit ... I didn't want to live and I didn't want to sing again. But I feel stronger now than I've ever felt. This is not my fantasy of what I want to be, but it is the reality and it's a lot more comfortable to live with."

Linda's fantasy began in Tucson, Arizona, where, at age 14, she began singing in a folkie group with her older sister and brother. In 1964, at age 18, she left for Hollywood with $30 in her pocket and joined a folk-rock group that became the Stone Poneys. After three frustrating years they broke up, just before "Different Drum" became a hit. As a solo, Ronstadt fronted numerous transient musicians, among them Glenn Frey and Don Henley, who went on to form the Eagles. Linda was unable to communicate with them on musical terms, she says, and she had difficulty bossing men around. "When I got to L.A.," she says, "I was so intimidated by the quality of everybody's musicianship that instead of trying to get better, I chickened out and wouldn't work." She also had problems with her first solo albums — "I didn't know what I was doing," she says. Her producers — among them John Boylan and J.D. Souther — would also be managing her or living with her, so that she was at once a singer, a lover, a daughter-figure and a puppet.

Finally, in 1973, she asked Peter Asher, the former pop singer (Peter and Gordon) and the producer of James Taylor, to help complete her Don't Cry Now album. On the road, anxious to please Asher, she brushed up on acoustic guitar, took command of a ragged band and, in short, grew up. Heart Like a Wheel was next. Asher is now her manager and producer.

"Peter," says Linda, "was the first person willing to work with me as an equal, even though his abilities were far superior to mine. I didn't have to fight for my ideas. I thought I couldn't understand machines, you know, and it turns out that the joke's on me. I finally realized, 'Gee, I can learn about digital delay... .' All of a sudden, making records became so much more fun. I used to get so depressed when I was in the studio that I would slither under the console and go to sleep with the monitors blaring. Just to escape."

"For the first time," Peter Asher notes, "Linda feels more in control of her career, she knows when she has a month off, when she has to do an album. She can see a pattern, a kind of reality to things. It's more like working for a living, as opposed to going through all the craziness. Before, she always felt that events were just rushing her along ... in a direction that was really up to the wind."

These days, Linda has the plucky air of a seasoned professional; and she has matured, as an artist and a woman. Ronstadt may still not be the sex goddess her album-photo-infatuated fans lust for, but she's getting closer.

Linda's stage attire has become more refined, too. Her standard Levi's and white blouse tied at the waist are frequently replaced by long, flowing dresses and halter tops.

But Ronstadt has quirks in her stage presence. She'll smile sweetly after a song, curtsy and then chirp, 'Didn't the Jerry Lewis telethon last night suck?' Her onstage confidence has grown considerably, and she projects success, helped along by applause from the audience, every time she begins a song.

Still, Ronstadt has hours of horror stories of stage terror and tearful backstage scenes dating as recently as the outset of her tour earlier this year. "I threw up on the way to the airport ... and for the first two weeks of the tour. I had taken six months off because I'd become a physical and emotional wreck, and now I thought I had an ulcer. I just didn't think I was good enough. Finally, I just went, 'Okay, I can go home and forget about it and get sued by every agent and promoter in the world and be completely unprofessional,' or I can say, 'Look, it can't get great in a month but I'm going to do a little better every night.' By the end of the tour, a month later, I was looking forward to every night."

But, she adds, "Believe me, things are not hunky-dory. They haven't invented a word for that loneliness that everybody goes through on the road. The world is tearing by you, real fast, and all these people are looking at you like you're people in stars' suits. People see me in my 'girl-singer' suit and think I'm famous and act like fools ... it's very dehumanizing.

"I think it's helping each other out that makes it bearable. The only way to deal with it is to have that real close camaraderie and to keep recycling it and teasing and keeping the humor level up all the time. You have to do it in an aggressive manner, though, or else it turns ugly. It was like group therapy, only worth more.

"When we came back to end the tour in L.A., I had my first feelings of a letdown. Suddenly, all these people weren't down the hall and you can't all sit around and drink coffee. We were so lonely that we turned to each other, then they all went home to their old ladies and I came home to the dog, you know."

It's very easy to become drawn in by Linda's tales of intense vulnerability, though Ronstadt has obviously been drawing on some kind of strength all these years. "Anybody can hurt my feelings; it's not very hard to do. But they don't get a second chance. I am not a professional victim, and there's plenty of those in this business because they see vulnerability as something attractive. If I see that someone or something is going to hurt me, I'll get the fuck out of its way. It's too easy to get destroyed. But, yeah, I worry. I try to walk that fine line between being strong and trying to avoid becoming callous. As soon as you're callous you not only shut out all the pain, but all the good stuff too. You either close the door or you open it. I keep the door open with the screen door slammed ... and a strong dog at the door. That's the policy of my heart.

"When I first started doing this," she muses, drawing her legs up close to her chest, "there weren't really any other [rock/pop] women singers, except for Maria Muldaur and Grace Slick. But Maria was the only one I really knew and neither of us could afford to go to psychiatrists then. Nobody had gone ahead of us and broken any of the ground on the kind of emotional problems that you experience being a woman in this particular place.

"I had a woman cousin at Yale, one of the first women to graduate ... and they studied these women very carefully and found that they developed all these masculine mannerisms ... in other words, they completely succumbed to the peer-group pressure in order to get recognition and acceptance. They all began to walk like a man. They began to cop butch attitudes, you know, and that's what's happened in this male-dominated business. I felt it happening to me and I decided to strike that from my personality. I like being a girl."

Another valuable lesson she's learned, she says, came from Dolly Parton. Emmylou Harris had called Linda over for some vocal and moral support when Parton dropped in on her sessions. They've since appeared together on Parton's syndicated TV show and become friends. "I've never met anybody so free of neurosis as that person," says Linda. "I was devastated by her honesty and her charm and sweetness. I'm sort of this Northern thinker and she's just kind of a Southern magnolia blossom that floats on the breeze. But she's no dummy.

"She taught me that you don't have to sacrifice your femininity in order to have equal status. The only thing that gives you equal status with other musicians is your musicianship. Period. It doesn't matter how butch you act, how much dope you can take or how many nights you can stay up in a row."

Linda has been widening her circle of musician friends, too. Phoebe Snow and noted session vocalist Valerie Carter — whom she's helping record a solo album, giving emotional and vocal support — are recent acquaintances. Snow turned her on to Charlie Parker and jazz singing. "I intend to do some heavy hanging out with her," Linda laughs. "It's another sphere of music to drag in."

When Mick Jagger turned up at her recent shows at the Universal Amphitheatre, she was as surprised as anybody. She brought him to the Valerie Carter sessions, where they hooked up with Lowell George and sang all night. Contrary to rumor, Ronstadt and Jagger did not discuss a one-shot duet album. "But maybe," she giggles, "I ought to write up a résumé."

Meanwhile, Ronstadt's accolades pile up. She didn't bother to show up and collect her Best Female Vocalist award on Don Kirshner's Rock Music Awards show (she called them the "Who Cares" awards). "My attitude is, 'Don't give me an award, send me money.' "She doubles up with laughter. "I know how good or bad I am. An award won't convince me that a record that I didn't think was good is good."

The doorbell rings. It's Wendy Waldman, another friend, dropping by to spend the cool late afternoon at the beach. The two immediately talk music, Linda rushing to a cassette machine to play a rough cut of a duet with Valerie Carter. "It's such a thrill," she gushes, "to sing with someone this incredible."

Waldman listens intently to the beautifully intertwined voices — Carter, the unharnessed youngster, and Ronstadt, the polished veteran.

"What do you think?" asks Linda.

"She's really good," Wendy says. "She'll learn ... just like you."

Linda smiles and stares at the cassette player. Then the intercom buzzes with my 4 p.m. lift and ... the phone starts ringing again. "Oh God," shrieks Linda, "I'm not even dressed yet. I always forget to get dressed."

 The laundry attendant at Holloway Cleaners was amazed, "You're Chris Hillman, aren't you? What are you doing here?" In another 15 minutes, Hillman was scheduled to make his Los Angeles solo debut at the Roxy nightclub down the street. He handed over his claim check. "I can't go to work in a dirty shirt," he said.

Chris Hillman's use of the word "work" should never be taken as an antimusic remark. He does not fashion himself an archetypal rock star, riding in limousines and worrying of nothing but the art. Ever since his too-much, too-soon days as bassist/guitarist with the Byrds, Hillman has demanded none of the luxuries of his trade. "Fuck all that other stuff," he laughs.

Now 31, Hillman has made his reputation by staying out of West Coast music spotlights. Whether with the Byrds or as a founding member of the Flying Burrito Brothers, Manassas and the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, he has been most content as the lurking accomplice.

Few even know of his discoveries. Hillman was one of the earliest supporters of the Buffalo Springfield, arranging for their first auspicious break as house band at the Whisky-A-Go-Go. It was even Hillman who brought fellow Byrd David Crosby over for a first look at the band that featured Crosby's future partners, Steve Stills and Neil Young. (Crosby's reaction: "Aww, I don't like 'em.") Years later, he stumbled onto Emmylou Harris — then a shy Joni Mitchellesque folk singer — in a Washington D.C. nightclub. "I wanted to sing with her, but I was too wrapped up in Manassas." Instead, he convinced Gram Parsons to give her a call. More recently, he helped his former backing band — now called Firefall — record the demos that led to their contract. "Look at me," Hillman likes to joke, "look at what I get for helping everybody out. A cult. I should recut 'Mr. Tambourine Man' disco."

Raised in the rural outskirts of San Diego, Hillman grew up in a strictly country & western household. He learned the bluegrass mandolin and spent several hard years on the country bar circuit. Then, to make some money for a change, Hillman went to work for Randy Sparks, who also employed John Denver. Hillman does not revel in the memory. "I was starving," he says, "so don't hold it against me."

He didn't work for Sparks long. When a friend, L.A. record producer Jim Dickson, told Chris about three determined folkies he was taping on his home recorder, Hillman followed the lead. Gene Clark, David Crosby and Jim (not yet Roger) McGuinn were impressive and, sure enough, Hillman volunteered his services as their bassist. He had never played the instrument before. "I learned quick," Hillman remembers.

They became the Byrds, and their long and turbulent story says Hillman, was steeped in history. Like the birth of folk-rock. "We were really copying the Beatles in a lot of ways. Originally, when 'Mr. Tamboruba Man' was presented to the group, we all hated it. It wasn't funky enough. But we finally worked it up and there it was . . . We tried playing a folk song with all these brand-new electric instruments that we'd just gotten . . . and it sounded completely different. What a rush."

But . . . "we were young. As soon as we started to make it we didn't give a shit. We'd go out onstage all stoned out, you know and stand there like statues and play. Still, there definitely were times when we'd get up onstage and steam. The Byrds and super stardom at 21 . . . it was one of those things that if you survive you learn. A lot of people end up as casualties, burnt out. You gotta make it through and learn . . . ."

Hillman remained with the Byrds until shortly after their classic country-rock experiment, Sweetheart of the Rodeo. "The Byrds," he says, "weren't happening around that time."

He and Gram Parsons, who had ended his brief stay with the Byrds three months before started a band that would take up where Sweetheart left off. The sad story of the Flying Burrito Brothers, though, is that they were always far, far ahead of their time.

"We had always hoped the band would become as successful as the Byrds were, but it never happened. We never had a hit single . . . just a lot of ups and downs. It was a magical, very productive period in my life. But nobody was really ready for us. Now, even the new Flying Burrito Brothers are doing all right. I do really suspect their motive, though. It's like me hiring four other guys and calling myself the Byrds. My point, though, is what we were doing is real popular now. For God's sake, I watch these groups with their rhinestone suits on, singing out of tune, playing shitty, and they're being accepted. It breaks my heart.

"We all worked so hard with that band. Goddamn it, we deserved success."

Like most bands in their position, the Flying Burrio Brothers splintered out of desperation. Hillman was helping Stephen Stills with his third solo album at the time of the final breakup. When Stills promptly offered him a partnership in Manassas, it seemed a comfortable solution to post-Burrito depression. "We were always more of a band than people thought," Hillman recalls fondly. "Stills wouldn't have been the same without us, that's for sure. Stills was playing a concert in Cleveland with the Memphis Horns. I was sitting in the audience, going, 'Jesus Christ. They're making 25,000 bucks and they're shitty. The Burritos are better than this.' I went backstage," Hillman chortles, "that's when we renewed the friendship. Manassas was the best band Stills ever played in."

Manassas also drifted in various directions. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young re-formed briefly, and Hillman agreed to help out with a Byrds reunion L.P. "It wasn't done right and I'm disappointed to have ended the Byrds legacy on that crummy a note."

When Gram Parsons and childhood friend former Byrds guitarist Clarence White both died during the same three month period Hillman was hit even harder." Gram's life, he was drinking again and getting a little weird. I always loved Gram — him singing the shit out of 'Hot Burrito #1' in the studio is a memory I'll always have — but I couldn't deal with him. He was very self-destructive. I know lots of guys that have had that. There is nothing you can do or say. Subconsciously, they want to kill themselves, and he did. It was a loss and I was upset, but I expected it.

"In all truthfulness, it upset me more when Clarence got killed because I grew up with him. My God, what a drag. He was putting his guitar in the back of a car and gets hit by a drunk. Crazy. Nobody could play guitar like him. Nobody."

Eventually, Hillman wound up part of then-Asylum Records president David Geffen's plan to surround singer/songwriter John David Souther with an all-star group. The result, the Souther-Hillman-Furay Band, was one of the strangest failures in rock & roll. By all indications, success was inevitable. Souther is a masterful songwriter in the Eagles mold. Furay's roots were Buffalo Springfield and Poco, and Hillman's utilitarian prowess supposedly cinched it.

"But we were awful," Hillman shrugs. "We were never a band. We barely even knew each other. It had all the good ingredients, but boy, the cake turned out bad. S-H-F was three guys making minisolo albums on each record. The only advantage is that it got all three of our names around.

"For a while there, it looked like S-H-F might have worked out — around the time of our second album, when Tom Dowd was about to produce us. But a couple of the guys developed personal problems. Then, getting toward the middle of the album, we knew we weren't going on the road, so . . . being quite honest with you, I just didn't bring out a couple of my songs. I think the other guys did the same thing. It was the weirdest group I've ever been in, that's for sure. I watched us on In Concert once and thought, 'Jesus, that's not a band. That's six guys up there playing.' I've got nothing bad to say about any of them. It just didn't work." Hillman smiles sardonically. "But when we get together for this reunion album . . ."

For his first solo album, Hillman turned to Bob Johnston, Dylan's producer on Nashville Skyline. The sessions took place in San Francisco. "We didn't get along at all, did not see eye to eye. After the first day, I knew it was a disaster." In his hotel room that night, the discouraged Hillman's telephone rang.

"Who calls me? Who's on my side? Fuckin' Stills. The guy who gets all the bad shit on his back. Stephen Stills. 'What's the matter?' he asks. I tell him about not being able to work with Bob Johnston. Stills says, 'Fine. Fire him. Come to Criteria Sound Studios [in Miami] and I'll get Ronnie and Howie [Albert, who produced Manassas].' And it happened [except the sessions were held in L.A.]. Bam. I didn't even think of using them. And they're so good. I'm gonna do another album with them, that's how much I like them."

Hillman maintains a trooper's attitude toward his return to clubs and opening-act concert appearances. "I'm starting over," he declares. "It's good discipline. I like working clubs. You have to turn yourself down and relate to the audience. It's intimate and it's good for you. Goddamn it, we're entertainers besides being musicians. We don't have to breathe fire, but we do have to get the people off, regardless of the circumstances."

The show, too, is a crowd-pleasing cross section of material from every stage of Hillman's career. "I can't stand a musician who says, 'Audiences are shitty, they only want to hear the hits.' Well, fuck you. If you can't get 'em off, that's your fault. They paid six bucks to see you. If someone yells out 'Heavenly Fire,' I'm flattered. I'll stop and do it. Those people support you, man. They buy your records. They supported me for all these years, I'm gonna take care of them.

"My bottom line," he vows, "is to have a good time. If I cease to have fun, I'll sell real estate. Honest to God. If I wanted to make a million, I'd go to Hollywood and hang out and play that game. Well, I don't want to do that. I'd rather work."

Chris Hillman throws out his chest and makes a muscle with his arm. "Just look at me," he boasts. "The hardest workin' man in country-rock."

Five days before the Michigan primary, on a sunny Saturday afternoon in May, the sprawling Fairlane shopping center, an indoor mall in Dearborn, is so thick with campaign workers of both parties that it's hard to take a step without being accosted by zealous volunteers brandishing buttons and bumperstickers.

Today, the shopping center is being visited by a major campaign figure — once removed. A young Republican worker rushes up to a knot of people, breaking the news with breathless reverence: "Did you hear? The president's son Jack is here! Just around the corner!" There's a commotion around the corner, all right, and a strange, nervous chuckle is rising above the hubbub; sort of an emphatic ah-ha, followed by three slightly forced heh-heh-hehs.

Then around the corner comes the owner of The Laugh, surrounded by swooning teenage girls. Jack Ford's three-piece suit — its color an exact match for his tousled sandy blond hair—hangs perfectly on his sleek, athletic, 24-year-old body. He loosens his tie and proceeds to sign the crinkled slips of paper thrust in front of him. He poses for dozens of Instamatic flash pictures and pumps every hand in sight.

"I'm Jack Ford and I'm here working to reelect my father. Can we count on your support?" That's the stock line he recites to almost everybody. Everybody, that is, except the prettiest girls, who get a slightly bolder variation. The steely blue-green eyes linger a little longer on theirs and, at the beginning of the handshake, Jack will simply say, "Your hand feels a little cold." On occasion he'll turn to one of his Secret Service agents and remark wistfully, "I wish there was something we could do about that." The effect is devastating, and instantaneous. One melted girl.

You get an immediate feeling that even if all these swooning young ladies were of voting age, they still wouldn't be thinking about reelecting the president. "God, what a fox," one squeals from across the mall. Very much within earshot, Jack flashes a self-conscious, gap-toothed grin and out comes . . . The Laugh.

Jack rolled out of his White House bed at 5:30 that morning. At 7:00 he boarded a commercial jet that landed at Detroit Metro Airport at 9:18. At 10:30 he was at television station WXYZ for an appearance on AM America. At noon he walked Kennedy Square, and at 1:00 WWJ radio interviewed him. The Dearborn Phone Bank had him at 2:30. He held a press conference at 3:15, and at 4:00 he arrived at the shopping center.

Three minutes after the autograph session, Jack, special press secretary Sheila Rabb Weidenfeld and a cluster of Secret Service agents took a small elevator to the shopping center tram stop. The tram would shoot them across the street and into the Hyatt Regency Hotel where Jack would have exactly 80 minutes of "personal time" — campaign jargon for that one small block of the day that is not filled with TV, radio and newspaper interviews, question-and-answer sessions with the public and pep talks to campaign volunteers.

I finally met Jack in the elevator. His campaign smile immediately sank, then went rigid. There was no grip in his handshake. His face was expressionless; the eyes as icy as the feeling you get watching yourself squirm in six pairs of Secret Service reflector shades.

Later, over dinner at his hotel, Jack remained distant. Talking issues, his studied tone sounded mostly like he was on automatic pilot. Understandably. The pace had been grueling ever since Ronald Reagan's sudden resurrection in the Texas primary a month before. And besides, Jack would have rather been back in Washington, checking out the Eagles-Jackson Browne-Linda Ronstadt concert. But wait. Wasn't that a benefit for . . .

"Jerry Brown." Jack's voice was matter-of-fact. "Yeah, that should be a good show. But there'll be plenty of concerts this summer. Frampton is coming. He's a pretty hot dude."

We inched through another half-hour of small talk — about the Playboy interview in which Abbie Hoffman called his father "a fucking bimbo . . . [who posed for a picture] marmalading the wrong side of his English muffins" ("I kinda liked that interview," Jack ventured), est and Scientology ("I lost a couple of friends to those organizations"), Hunter Thompson ("What kind of guy is he?"), Ron Nessen's appearance on NBC Saturday Night ("I didn't see it, but I don't think it was too popular around the White House") and about his notorious fling with Bianca Jagger last summer (silence). With the exception of a few brief glimmers of animation, Jack was wooden throughout. At the mention of being photographed for a magazine cover, he stiffened even further.

And finally I understood. Perhaps this wasn't quite the White House coaching him to play it straight, after all. Maybe Jack was nervous.

He sighed and toyed with his cheeseburger. "Well, yeah, a little bit. I knew you guys would catch up with me sooner or later. I've been kinda waiting around, wondering when Rolling Stone would show up.

"When I finally heard you wanted to come out on the campaign, I got really unsure. All the delays you got from the White House. That was me going back and forth on the whole idea. Ultimately, Sheila convinced me it was a good thing to do. . . ."

Scared of what?

"Well, I wasn't really scared." More cheeseburger fiddling. "I was leery about whether it was an interview . . . uhm, in terms of Jack Ford or whether it was an interview where I could convey my father's message a little bit better. I'm not looking for publicity. It isn't my personality to be even campaigning like this, much less doing interviews. I just wanted to participate. I'll never get a chance to do it again. Besides, none of my brothers or my sister were really up for it . . . the public campaigning. Susan's not political. She thinks politics are boring. Mike is real intense—all he wants to do is graduate from divinity school and preach the gospel. Steven is only a little active. He spends most of his time on a ranch in California — Mission Viejo I think it is — and going to college at Cal Poly. So that leaves me.

"I'm not a politician and I never want to be. I still want to be able to . . . you know, slip into the masses." Jack took a few quiet minutes to smoke, something he tries not to do in public, then got up and headed for his room. The agents, seated at various parts of the restaurant, smoothly left their tables to form a trail behind him.

One hour later, Jack was eating another dinner, a pasty, four-course Greek feast on a paper plate. If it was indeed doing war in his stomach with the cheeseburger and chocolate malt, his face sure didn't show it. He looked intent, concerned with the matters he was discussing with a community representative dressed in a Greek toga. "I promise to bring the plight of Cyprus to my father's attention," Jack assured him.

Wyandotte, Michigan holds a Greek festival every year at this time, renting the biggest hall in town. All through the night, 400 Greek-Americans ate, drank and even considered the welfare of the mother country.

There is certainly no way to get the attention of 400 loud, boozing Greeks and few of them even knew the president's son was there. Still, after several weeks of heavy canvassing, there were precious few events left for the candidates, much less their children. Jimmy Carter's two eldest kids were scheduled to arrive in 45 minutes, to see the same toga-clad representative.

That's still cutting it too close, the Secret Service figured. In one sweeping motion, Jack was hustled out the back door. I joined the entourage, as approved, carrying a shoulder bag with my tape recorder inside.

I remembered seeing a badge just as I hit the ground. Five local undercover agents, employed by the Wyandotte Police Department, handcuffed me and confiscated the shoulder bag. They were already dismantling the tape recorder when a Secret Serviceman stopped everything and explained that I was traveling with Jack. An undercover agent depressed the play button on the recorder, saw that it still worked and offered a handshake. "Sorry about that," he said. "We had a report about someone who looked just like you." Later, a Secret Serviceman said: "That's like saying, 'I didn't think I would come in your mouth.'"

It was another hour by rent-a-car motorcade to the next stop, a Young Republican disco dance in Macomb County. Jack was met at the door by a boisterous glad-hander with a huge name tag that blared "Dave."

"How ya doin', Jack?" he boomed. "My name's Dave."

The live band, everyone told Jack, is really hot. He nodded. "They sure are." And with a timid version of "Love Rollercoaster" bouncing in the background, Jack grabbed a beer and began to circulate. By unofficial count, he told seven girls their hands were cold.

Close to one in the morning, rumpled and exhausted, Jack returned to his hotel. The group of girls who spent all day hanging around the lobby had long since left. The hotel was empty, save for a few tipsy couples from a nearby high school prom. Unnoticed, Jack and his protection crew marched into an elevator.

On the fifth floor, the doors opened on an unsuspecting middle-aged black couple. A hand was shoved in their direction: "I'm Jack Ford. I'm here working to reelect my father." The couple exchanged blank looks. "I know the candidate so well," he ad-libbed earnestly. "He's the most capable. I'm not just saying that because I want to stay in the White House. I would gladly change places with you." The couple remained silent. Jack half-smiled, shrugged and moved past them. "Change places with me?" the husband muttered. "Shit, I didn't see him offerin' no contracts."

When Jack Ford pleads for anonymity, he is probably to be believed. His ambition is to be a forester . . . keeping law and order in the wilds when he's on duty, chugging beers and fishing when he's off. His convictions for the kick-back life run high, even though it wasn't so long ago that he charted his course for philosophy. "Philosophy was my first major in college," he recalled. "But then my philosophy teacher convinced me that there were no jobs in philosophy, not unless I wanted to teach it. I didn't really want to do that, so I switched to forestry. Later I found out there were no jobs there either."

Living in Logan, Utah, and going to the Utah State University, Jack did manage to find some summer jobs. "I was employed one summer as a fire-fighting crew member. We went to fires in Idaho, Nevada and Utah. It was great." During the next school year, Richard Nixon appointed Jack's father vice-president. Suddenly, the curb outside his campus apartment was painted red. Whenever Jack was home, the Secret Service was parked outside. This did not make him happy. "That was probably when I started craving the time I spent alone, not without the agents but at least not so blatantly covered by them," he said.

After Jack graduated from high school, he tried Jacksonville University for a year and a half "because I liked the idea of sunshine" and then transferred to forestry-minded Utah State. He spent his last summer in Logan working as a seasonal park ranger in Yellowstone National Park. "We only got a newspaper there once a week," he recalled, "if we were lucky."

It was during his stay at Yellowstone that Richard Nixon announced his resignation. Jack was out on horseback patrol. He had not read or heard any of the preliminary publicity. "I was ten miles off any main road," is the way he explained it, "but the second I reached it, I was shoved into a car that drove me about three miles to this open field where a helicopter picked me up . . . and the next thing I knew, I was in Washington."

As soon as his father became president, Jack was out of work. Because the federal government does all the hiring in the field of forestry, Jack Ford was immediately forbidden employment under nepotism laws. As long as his father is in office, the situation will remain the same. In the meantime, Jack is biding his time. He moved into the White House, he says, for the election year. "It's a once in a lifetime experience, to be right in the middle of a presidential election. It's an education I can't pass up." After November 2nd — "probably on the 3rd" — he'll move back out again. His first choice is San Diego.

When I met up with Jack a second time in Los Angeles, two weeks later, he was amazingly relaxed. Aside from a tourist's obsession with discussing the weather, he fit right in. Gone was the suit and tie. In their place, sandals, brown cords and a peasant shirt. He spotted me in the audience during a station break at KHJ-TV's Tommy Hawkins morning talk show. He was disarmingly breezy. "Hey, how's it goin'?"

Jack explained there would be more than enough time for another interview on the way to Santa Barbara in a Winnebago rented for the campaign. I suggested we start the conversation there, of course, and maybe finish up at his room in the White House.

"Don't kid yourself," Jack interrupted, "you're not good-looking enough for that." He fired his gap-toothed grin but spared me The Laugh. "Anything you want. It's up to you."

He took a seat next to Tommy Hawkins, a popular local TV host who allows viewers to call in questions to his guests.

"We're visiting with Jack Ford," Hawkins said, "the 24-year-old son of President Gerald Ford. We'll go back here to line two. . . . Hello there."

Silence.

"Turn down your television."

"Oh," chirped a voice, "good morning, Tommy."

"Good morning."

"Hi, Jack."

"How are ya?"

"All right. I'd like to ask you about your views on homosexuality."

A stunned pause.

"Uhhm . . . my views on that are something I haven't given much thought to, quite frankly. I think I try to respect everyone's point of view or difference of opinion. I don't have any strong feelings either way, quite frankly. I'm not in a position to give it much thought, quite frank . . . to be quite honest." Tommy threw Jack a life preserver.

"All right, thanks for the call."

Quite frankly. . . . Already I've noticed that it's Jack's favorite verbal tic when he's speaking for the record. He uses it as a bridge, a time filler, a qualifier and a tool of candor — sometimes all four in the same sentence. Only one problem: he doesn't know he uses it so much . . . and nobody really brings it to his attention.

Jack's cheery attitude, I figured, was partly due to President Ford's surge of victories in Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee. Two weeks earlier, the picture had been bleak. At least today, even in Reagan's home state, the Ford camp felt sure of a first-ballot victory at the convention in August.

Boarding the Winnebago in L.A., though, an agent suggested a more universal reason for all the smiles: it was Friday, the last day of campaigning before Memorial Day weekend. After the Santa Barbara appearances, the camper would head up the coast to Monterey, where Jack would spend the three days off "with a friend."

KNXT-TV Evening News Interview with Bill Stout:

Stout: A number of the women around here, men too, have been wondering how can you possibly maintain any kind of privacy in your personal life with all the Secret Service around. How far do they follow you? 
Ford: (The Laugh) They're always close by. 
Stout: Always? 
Ford: Always. They certainly don't sit down on the couch with me, so to speak, but they keep a pretty close eye and, quite frankly, there's good reason for it. Despite the fact that I might not care to have them with me. 
Stout: Doesn't it cramp your style, to use an old-fashioned term. 
Ford: In some cases it makes me feel a little less private. They're very often close to earshot distance. But they operate in total confidentiality. However, someone who's not as used to it and doesn't have that confidence probably feels, quite frankly, more uncomfortable. 
Stout: Miss X, for instance. Ever had a lady say, "It's been nice, but I just as soon not do it again with all those men around." 
Ford: (The Laugh) Quite frankly, it's probably to the contrary. If she doesn't like me, there's always three or four other guys that she can devote her attentions to.

Jack Ford "does not know" who picks the agents that cover his movements. He doesn't really care either. "If there's someone really bad, they get taken care of in short order . . . most of them aren't much older than me anyway."

Most of his Secret Servicemen are, in fact, in their late 20s or early 30s and — when they're not conversing through palm-sized short-wave radios or trying to melt into a crowd — friendly. "They define their individual roles," Jack figured. "I have a definite comradeship with some of them, but that's simply a result of the time I spend with them. I would never really consider them friends in a true sense. They know when to draw the line between business and friendship."

Nevertheless, the three men with him for his California stay are familiar faces he can pal around with. Once the Winnebago hits the coastal highway, a Doobie Brothers tape starts blasting and they all keep their eyes peeled for the California girls, yelping over the choicest carloads. Already, Jack is talking about cracking open that case of beer for the long ride to Monterey tonight.

After a while, I reminded Jack about the interview.

"Right. Just let me change."

Twenty minutes later, he emerged from the vehicle's refrigerator-sized bathroom in a green tennis shirt and dutifully plopped down across from me at a card table. With him staring straight at me and his arms folded, the mood was almost one of an arm-wrestling championship. "All right," he said.

I mentioned Bianca Jagger's much-publicized interview (and clutching photos) with him in Andy Warhol's Interview magazine. After all the disapproving press and even his mother's disclaimer, was he sorry he ever got involved?

"I'm not sorry about it." Jack said tersely. "I didn't get a lot out of it. It was probably the least stimulating interview I've ever done, quite frankly. I have a hard time reading Andy Warhol's magazine. Really. It just doesn't grab my interest. It's probably a good idea to write everything down exactly the way it happened, but it doesn't make for great reading. You don't have to be a writer to do that kind of interview. I like to read. I like good writers. I like to read something creative, instead of a playback . . . type of thing."

Did you get a lot of flak from the White House over that?

"I got flak from people. But you know, the people who are always quick to criticize, to say, 'Aw, what a foopaux, are the lightweights. They're quick to criticize everything, no matter what you do. You learn to know who they are. That's the primary area of criticism. I had a lot of reservations myself, especially since the pictures were not interview pictures, but pictures among . . . acquaintances."

There was a time last year when luring Jack Ford to your concert was a common practice for any band playing the Washington D.C. area. And it wasn't uncommon to succeed. He went to concerts by or posed in backstage pictures with Earl Scruggs, George Harrison and the Rolling Stones. Harrison, Billy Preston, Tom Scott, as well as Bianca and Warhol, were White House guests. Harrison spent an afternoon with the president.

Later, Jack told an interviewer that he had smoked pot, strong words even in the Age of Candor. Then, just as quickly as he had stepped into the limelight, Jack was conspicuously inconspicuous. No more splashy shoulder-rubbing. No sensationalism. Whose idea was this lower profile, his or the White House's?

Jack stared out the window of the Winnebago. He knew the question well. "You know, it was a decision that I made myself. I found myself getting into that trap of becoming a public figure myself. I mean, it was a great opportunity. I liked the idea of meeting some of these people and doing some of those things. But it was generating bottomless, baseless publicity. I just wasn't interested in having that happen. I made a conscious decision that I was not going to do interviews. I was not going to do any appearances at anything.

"I continued going to concerts, but I always bought the tickets myself. Unannounced. Nobody knew. It worked out a lot better. I enjoyed myself a lot more. I'm sure there were people who had suggested I cool it, but nobody ever said it to me. Whatever I did, I did on my own."

So he wasn't sorry he admitted smoking pot? "Absolutely not," Jack grinned. The Laugh. "They all quote me on that, all the magazines, but it's never the whole picture. It's never the Whole Story I was trying to paint. It's always just 'Jack Ford smoked pot.' Period. Which was not the total reference. It goes back to this thing you've probably heard me say over and over again. Dad said, you know, if we're gonna have that peace of mind after this whole crazy experience is over with, you've got to answer all the questions as truthfully as possible. I said what I said because my father encourages the truth. That's the Whole Story. I was concerned that people have tried to take the marijuana thing and use it to undercut my father. When, in fact, I think it's a tremendous plus for him that he would encourage honesty at consequence to himself."

I stared right back at him. Do you still smoke?

"No." The Laugh.

Why? Because your father is the president?

"Uhhhhm. . . ." Jack shifted his weight. "Uhhhhm . . . all factors considered, it didn't seem to be . . . uhhhhm . . . a needed part of my life. It just made life a lot easier not to than to do it.

"I made an evaluated decision before smoking. I started seeing all my friends smoke pot in my sophomore year of high school [in Alexandria, Virginia] and at first it shook me up. Here I was, the A-1 Jock, All-American Image Kid. Eventually I decided the pro-marijuana people were more accurate than those against. It was purely intellectual."

Well . . . I sprung it on him . . . LSD?

"No. I was as misadvised as anybody. I didn't want to take any chances . . . there were always those two camps, the great hard-liners and the ones who thought drugs were all right. Either way, drugs never played a big role in my life."

(One of his Secret Service agents — anonymously — agreed: "Jack is not the stoned hippie that a lot of people seem to think he is. I remember a rumor once that he was dealing cocaine . . . out of the White House or something. He's a guy that really likes privacy. I get the feeling that as long as he can sneak off with friends — which he does a lot — he kind of likes being famous. But he's pretty straight around us. Who knows what he does when he's hanging out with friends . . . he probably smokes a joint or two. But he's not a pothead. Basically, Jack Ford is a conservative kid that just started loosening up a few years ago.")

Jack was anxious to move the subject from drugs . . . so what about his "gut reaction" to Jimmy Carter?

Jack seemed glad to relax. "I think he's gotten into a situation where he's probably a really good man, a really well-intending man . . . but when you get ahead, you start playing politics instead of maybe being the man that worked so well before. I think he's found himself in this trap and it's coming back to haunt him a little bit."

Do you find, campaigning around the country, that America is still obsessed with Richard Nixon?

"There's a lot of Richard Nixon antagonism. It's very much on everybody's mind. A lot of people feel like they got . . . uhm . . . taken advantage of and screwed over beyond their wildest dreams. A lot of people put a lot of time into his campaign and so forth, now they feel that he tread on them and abused them in a totally unfair manner. Quite frankly, I'm one of those people. I worked for Richard Nixon in '72. I voted for Richard Nixon. I thought he was the best candidate. I tried to help him in any way possible. Now I feel terribly abused."

Did you spend any time around him?

"I didn't spend any time with him as a man. Not when he was president. I had met him and been around him at other times, at conventions. We had sort of casual encounters. . . ."

Like what?

"Just on reception lines and so forth. Very superficial. Like everyone else I thought, 'Wow, this is the president.' I was as equally naive as anybody else."

Naive in what way?

"I didn't understand what the game of no-rules politics is all about. It wasn't whether you were right or wrong; it was whether or not you got caught. Part of that naiveté had to do with my father . . . he was always one who never played that game. It was always whether you were right or wrong with him."

Do you feel Richard Nixon used your father?

"He used my father quite a bit. My father is just one of those guys that looks a person in the eye and treats them the way he would like to be treated. Quite frankly, Richard Nixon didn't treat my father the way my father treated him. He feels that if a guy can look him in the eye and say, 'I am not a crook,' he should take that man at his word. It was a man-to-man thing. Richard Nixon abused that trust and that confidence."

Yet you say that pardoning Nixon was the wisest decision your father has ever made.

"Unquestionably. In terms of the good of the whole country. To get away from Richard Nixon, to get away from Watergate. Quite frankly, again, to try and build our future. We could dwell on Watergate and Richard Nixon the rest of our lives. No question, it was probably the lowest point in the history of our country. But, you know, we've got some tremendous problems in this country. Economic and moral problems. I don't think dwelling on Richard Nixon is the answer to those problems. If he hadn't been pardoned, his trial would still be going on. He'd be in every headline . . . it would have put Patty Hearst behind the comic pages. So it was a good lesson to all of us. I think everybody heard, when they were growing up, if you tell one lie you find yourself in another lie. Pretty soon they all come back to haunt you. How more basic can it be?"

How about your fling with Chris Evert. Was that built up by the press too?

"Without a doubt." He's relieved to say it. "It's like two people who have a sort of common bond . . . two people of approximately the same age group who can share a mutual pressure, a mutual exposure in their life. We have a really strong bond between us in that respect. I enjoy our relationship at that level . . . much better than I do as a romance. But I guess it's too good for the press to pass up.

"It's a big question for me. Girls. How do I sneak 'em in? Who do I see? I always try to down-play it as much as possible. It's the one area I've been fairly effective at keeping private. I've got some pretty steady ladies here and there. Nobody's really picked up on them, which is good as far as I'm concerned."

Do you sneak off and see them a lot?

"Sure."

And the agents come with you?

"The agents are nearby. You know, that's one of the things I'll do here in California. Today, as a matter of fact. I'm going off to see this nice lady who is very happy to have a good relationship with me and not have it be a public demonstration of some kind. She knows where our relationship stands. She's a good lady for it."

What type of girl is it that you like?

"Two arms . . . two legs. I don't think I can even answer that. What type of girl do you like? Someone with a mind, a life of her own and someone who's independent. Someone who doesn't depend on Jack Ford for her thrills. Someone who's understanding."

Do you get upset over your father being portrayed as a klutz?

"Yeah, I do. Not so much lately, though. He's always being photographed. He's less vain than any other president in a long time. Hell, have you ever gone an entire week — even a day — without tripping or bumping your head on something? What if everything you did was photographed. People don't seem to realize it.

"Why does my father have that reputation as being so clumsy? He's an older man, yet I see him skiing and swimming with the power of someone half his age. So I've learned to just not let anything else bother me. I spend so much time around the administration, I just can't let it become my entire life.

"But the fact is that we've always had these presidents that were so intense, you know. Their image was so important to them that they lost touch with the real world that way. This is something my father's been able to preserve a little bit. Whether or not he can do it over a six-and-a-half-year period is another question, but so far he's been able to do it. I think that's good."

Did you read the Playboy interview with Sara Jane Moore?

"I read the first part of it and skimmed the rest very briefly. I think it was in an airport terminal. I don't like to read stuff like that. It kinda freaks me out. It's like my great temptation to read Helter Skelter, even though I'm not really sure I want to. It almost touches a little too close to home. I don't want to develop this paranoia, this fear of some kind. I want to try and stay away from that attitude. It can be really intimidating. Every time I go by a bookstand, I see Helter Skelter. I reach for it and I draw back and I reach for it and draw back. I just don't want to have to think about any of those things the next time I'm pushing through a crowd.

"There are those people out there who feel a tremendous need to strike out. Whether it be father or another member of my family . . . whether it be me, you could easily get to that point where maybe the Nixons got to. They were almost afraid to go out and be with real people and not a self-contained, controlled situation.

"I can't tell you how freaked I get when I go through a crowd and see how easy it is for one person, with one very simple, easy gesture, to snuff you on the spot. I just don't think I should read an in-depth study of someone who wasn't motivated in a true political sense. I can understand the political motivation more than the macabre need to randomly strike out with no real plan or principle. The president has to accept that possibility, of course, but I really get scared for my father sometimes. Even though, the worst thing that could happen to this country would be for a small group of people to intimidate and repress the president or any government official.

"When my father was first sworn in, there was a great debate among us whether or not any of the kids beyond my sister, who had gotten some very definite threats, would take Secret Service protection. Dick Kaiser — the head of protection detail — sort of sat us down and appealed to us. 'Do you realize that you're putting the president of the United States in a position where he might have to choose between family and country?' It's a heavy thought. And I was very vulnerable at the time I heard it. Less than 24 hours before, I had been in Yellowstone, just cruising around. Suddenly, I have a duty to my country. So I consented to the protection.

"In the beginning, you think you have a choice in the matter. In the end, you realize you never really did. Later on, I said, 'Hey, that was a really effective pitch. You had me convinced. I'm sold. You came on pretty heavy.' And I was told, 'Oh, that was just the soft sell. If we hadn't convinced you, we would have shown you some of the more incredible death threats and phone call reports.'"

Are you persuaded by advisers to adopt any other attitudes?

"No. It was my idea to campaign. I came back to Washington specifically to get involved. To see what it was like living in the White House, to see what it was like going through the heart of a campaign.

"I didn't get along with some of the people who were originally at the campaign. My ideas and theirs were a little different. They said, 'Great, we can have you down here opening letters and answering phone calls. You'll be great. We need more volunteers like you.' It just wasn't my idea of how to get involved. We went on with that battle through June, July, August . . . about what I'd do. Finally I just of sort of threw my hands up and said, 'I'll do my own thing.'

"I'd made a few friends there and they booked me into some situations. So we circumvented the huge powers in my father's campaign. And here I am. I had the whole plan worked out. I said, 'Let's not go the Ed Muskie route of locking up all the party pros and all the endorsements with no basis for it, no grassroots support.' That's where we suffered a great deal in the early campaign. We realized our mistake and got away from the endorsement route and that's where our strength has come from lately. . . ."

How have you found life at the White House?

The answer was quick." Living in the White House can be very intimidating. It's an experience of a lifetime, but there's also the feeling that you're living in a museum. My room is all right. It's not very big. I can usually relax there. But then there's that feeling that you'll round the corner, wearing just your shorts — and run into a group of tourists."

Jack sighed and beat a fist lightly on the table. "I'm getting tired of hearing myself talk." He got up, found a tape of Frampton Comes Alive! to replace the Doobie Brothers and returned to his chair. "Frampton . . . my main man. He brought the magic back to rock & roll."

I asked him who's impressed him the most, of all the celebrities he's met since his father took office.

"In terms of entertainment people, I would probably say George Harrison. He was able to get away from the celebrity aspects and communicate a little bit as a person. His energy level is a little bit higher than mine, but he impressed me also with the people he had around him. There seemed to be a comraderie-ship that I haven't seen in some other cases.

"The other person that impressed me, because he wasn't at all consistent with his image, was Mick Jagger. He was incredibly sharp, incredibly astute, very tuned in and right on top of whatever was happening. If he hadn't gone into music, he probably would have been successful at anything. He's just so smart and so sharp. I didn't get a chance to sit down and talk with him on a personal basis, but I came away with a very positive feeling about his creative abilities."

Were you disappointed he never came to the White House?

"Well, I never invited him. I invited Bianca . . . I'll tell ya. After the George Harrison-Bianca thing, it just became easier, not that I wouldn't like these people to come to my home, but it wasn't a case of them coming to my home. It was a case of them coming to the White House. It sort of destroyed the nature of it. It always ended up a big press play."

Your mother said in print that you were being used by those people.

"Well, that was in reference to the guy who released the pictures of Bianca Jagger and me. I think Dirck Halstead or whoever took the pictures was at one point considering suing the guy who released the photos, because they were his and not the guy's who released them."

Hypothetically, if it was Reagan versus Carter in November . . . or even Reagan versus Brown . . . would you keep a hard-line Republican stance?

Long thought. "I don't know. I know it's a cop-out, but it's really not one of those things I've thought about. I don't really think it's gonna happen. I feel very sure about the fact it's not gonna happen, in fact. I'll make that decision when I come to it."

Who is your father thinking about for his running mate?

"Pete Wilson, the mayor of San Diego, is a good man. He's another one who cuts across political affiliations. [Christopher] Kit Bond, the governor of Missouri, is a possibility. He's a good, attractive candidate from a political sense. He generates good energy. Dan Evans, governor of Washington, could be the one. Maybe Howard Baker."

What about Ronald Reagan?

"Well, he was once a candidate for vice-president." The Laugh.

"No more. I really want to beat Ronald Reagan. Man, if California was a crossover state we could run a hell of an election, running just on 'Let's beat Ronald Reagan' regardless if you're with us or against us. There'd be a lot of people who'd vote for us. He scares me. Quite frankly, Reagan does scare me. The way he talks . . . he's an incredible reactionary. This is the guy that said, 'If the students want a blood bath, let them have it now.' I really want to beat his ass."

Have you read The Final Days?

"No."

All the President's Men? "No. I haven't seen the movie either."

Why not?

"I don't think either of those books are the type of books that you pick up and put down, four or five times a day. . . ."

One of the agents let out a shout. "Hey Jack! There's some girls that want to wave to you." Jack got up and looked out the window. "Hello ladies," he waved.

"AAAAAAA-WOOOOO." The girls sped off.

". . . Yeah, so, to get the full impact of those books you've got to read them. Really read them. I just don't have the luxury right now."

Have there been any cases of girls you once went with trying to sell their story?

"Yeah there have. As a matter of fact, there's a girl that I didn't even go out with who tried to do that. It was a girl that Dave Kennerly was going out with. He brought her by one day when I was getting ready to take my mother to see the American Folk Festival. David took a shot of his girlfriend on one of my arms and my mother on the other at the folk festival.

"Well, David obviously gave her one and she gave it right over to some press agent. . . she was trying to start a career, whatever. There was this whole story about my love for her and how she went to my mother and said, 'Should Jack and I get married?' and my mother said, 'No, your career is more important. Wait.' And, you know, I never took the girl out. But here was this picture with me. It got abused and used very badly. All things considered, though, I've been pretty lucky."

On that note, the camper rumbled into Santa Barbara City College. Jack was scheduled to do an interview with the campus television station and later a question-and-answer forum with the students. He threw on a brown blazer, hopped out of the camper and started shaking hands.

"How did you get all the good publicity," he cracked to one student. "I don't see any great weather." The sea breeze was blowing hard through Santa Barbara and with his hair flying in the wind, Jack Ford resembled his father for the first time.

In the television studio, he was interviewed by the dean. The show went well, considering most of the dean's overphrased queries were twice as long as Jack's answers. Afterward, he was led out to a lunch area podium before several hundred students. From the first moment he greeted them, it was obvious that Jack Ford was not facing his father's most loyal supporters. "You fucked up, Jack?" someone yelled. He ignored it and explained briefly that he was not there to give speeches but to field questions. "Hopefully, I can convey your concerns to my father. . . ."

He answered the usual questions about The Nixon Pardon, Chris Evert and Ronald Reagan, using an unusually large amount of "quite frankly"s. As he finished, the same hoarse yeller screamed: "Bulllllllshhhhiiiitttt."

Jack climbed back into the Winnebago, a little dejected. Regardless of the largely negative reception, Jack Ford was still a star. Several students peered inside the camper. Some even jogged alongside as he left. Managing a winning smile, Jack called out his standard salutation: "Take it easy!" The smile quickly faded. "You know," he said, "the difference between a few years ago and now is that the antagonism is still there, but there isn't any followup. They ask belligerent questions, but wouldn't think about working their ass off for the cause. . . . How do you think I did?"

I told him he was using more than his quota of "quite frankly"s.

"Everytime I cure myself of one phrase, I subconsciously find another one." He groaned. "That much, huh? Quite frankly, I'm concerned." Smiling once again, Jack settled down to listen to Peter Frampton. After a few minutes, he sighed. "This is such an emotional drain. I can't wait to get down to doing something more logical!"

I asked him a question, perhaps The Question, that I didn't get a chance to bring up before: do you really, deep in your heart, want your father to be reelected?

Jack turned his stare out the window again. He likes watching the beach whiz by. "Deep in my heart? I don't even have to go that deep. No." He thought about what he'd just said. "It's an incredible paradox, you know. I get up in the morning and say to myself, 'God, does it really make sense to do this, even if I'm not convinced that I want him to be president.' You know, I had an excellent life long before this happened. Maybe that's not the case for some First Family members. I had a really good life. I wasn't disappointed. Life looked good to me. In fact, it looked better to me then than it does now.

"I've never been addicted to the pomp and the regality. See, I can even remember the good old days when dad was vice-president. The Good Old Days. A friend of mine and I hitchhiked down to visit my parents in Palm Springs. We drove up to the gate of the place they were staying, and we were in this pickup truck with two chicks. Dirty . . . and sweaty. They made my father come down and identify me. That was before Secret Service protection. I felt very loose and very free then. . . ."

Next stop — University of California at Santa Barbara, where another q&a session and a meeting with the school newspaper had been scheduled. After that, an AM radio interview, a visit to the local newspaper and back-slapping appearance at the Santa Barbara reelection committee. I began to notice some patterns. Older women ask after Mrs. Ford ("She's fine"), the men wonder, with man-to-man confidentiality, how Chrissie Evert's doing ("She's fine") and their kids want to know Jack's favorite groups ("Frampton, Nils Lofgren and Joy of Cooking").

At the end of the day, a day where Jack Ford hasn't stopped answering questions for more than 20 minutes, he looked completely exhausted. Surrounded by volunteers in the parking lot of the committee headquarters, Jack confessed, "I haven't eaten all day. We're just gonna grab a bite up the road and I'm going to relax for the evening."

"You do that," advised a motherly worker.

"Take care!" Jack shouted as he climbed into the camper. The fired-up volunteers rushed back in to attack the phones.

I climbed in after Jack to say goodbye. The handshake was firm this time. Jack, his Monterey Weekend blazing in his eyes, had already gotten his second wind. "We're gonna crack open some beers, kick back and tool up north." It's almost become a chant for him.

I climbed out and the Winnebago pulled into the street. Jack leaned out his window. "Take care!"

An agent scolded him. "Don't give him that 'take care' crap."

The van was turning the corner and Jack had to lean out even further. "Don't forget," he yelled, "I'm Jack Ford and I'm here working to reelect my father. Can we count on your support? . . ."

The Winnebago had disappeared, but I could still hear it. The Laugh.


T'S LIKE STEPPING INTO A SCENE from Blow Up. The white walls of Francesco Scavullo’s Manhattan photo studio are covered with Black and white portraits of blank-expressioned models. Young male assistants scurry around, each of them trying to act more hassled than the next. “I am not smiling,” whines one. “Streisand’s new hairstyle? Please.”

In another room, looking very much out of place, 25-year-old Peter Frampton waits to have his picture taken for the cover of ROLLING STONE. He squirms while a makeup man dabs colors on his cheeks and eyelids, readying him for a session with one of the world’s most renowned fashion photographers. It’s all happening so fast. Three months ago, Frampton was just another hard-working British rocker, crisscrossing the country with a four-album repertoire. Today, he is the brightest new star of ’76.

If it is Peter Frampton’s year, this must be his week. Only yesterday he returned from a ten-day vacation in St. Thomas – his first rest from the road in three years. His fifth album, Frampton Comes Alive!, was Number One (with a bullet) in two out of three trade listings. Bill Graham had to add a second Frampton concert at the 50,000-seat Oakland Stadium. The first sold out in several hours, as did most dates of his current tour.

I wonder if I’m dreaming
I feel so ashamed
I can’t believe this is happening
to me 
– “Show Me the Way”

Frampton pries himself away from the makeup man to greet his visitor. “You mean you still recognize me?” he jokes a little uneasily. “I’m in such a daze. Do you believe all that’s happened? Number One? Do you believe it? What a giggle.” He is quickly led before the camera and the blitz-clicking is on.

“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” marvels another Scavullo assistant. “Helen Reddy flies us all to Los Angeles, pays a fortune and begs Francesco to make her look beautiful. This kid waltzes in wearing Levi’s and beats them all.”

Photo sessions, especially ones where he is made up and ordered to “look sexy,” drain the slight guitarist. “I don’t walk around like this, not even onstage,” Frampton says as he embraces himself and pouts. “What’s wrong with smiling? Especially now . . . “

(In response, ROLLING STONE asked Bud Lee to shoot Peter in a more relaxed mood. A last-minute change-of-mind resulted in a ROLLING STONE first: one cover by Scavullo, one by Lee.)

After seven years of tireless touring (two of them as second guitarist in Humble Pie, five as a solo artist), Frampton deserves to wear his infectious smile more than ever. He’s finally struck pay dirt and cannot find a big enough superlative to tell you how knocked out he is, how incredible it feels, how much his head is spinning. It must be the high point of his life.

Frampton agrees. “I was asleep when Dee [his manager, Dee Anthony] called up to tell me we’d gone to Number One. He usually calls up and says, ‘Peta, it’s Dee,’ imitating an English accent. But this time he didn’t say anything except ‘we’re Number One’ in this cracking, emotional voice I’d never heard before. I was really moved. It was so fantastic. I called my parents in England and woke them up because of the time difference. I didn’t cry . . . but I sure came close.” He looks down at his spindly hands. “I’m shaking just talking about it all now. It’s very, very emotional . . . but then people are . . . people are buying my life when they’re buying those records. I hate to sound bigheaded or something, but that’s the reality of it. Suddenly, everything you’ve been doing means something.”

For Dee Anthony – currently celebrating is 25th year in the business – Frampton’s new status is more proof of the adage he’s held ever since road managing Tony Bennett in 1952 . . . take your music to the people. It’s no coincidence that most of Anthony’s biggest acts have broken wide open with live albums – Humble Pie, Emerson, Lake and Palmer, the J. Geils Band, Joe Cocker and Ten Years After. From his office at Bandana Enterprises in New York, the hulking manager works his bands twice as hard as any of his contemporaries. “Sooner or later,” he explains, “it pays off.”

All those around him feel that success has completed Frampton in many ways. Most noticeable is his newfound self-assurance. “It’s so good to see him this happy,” says a friend. “He was putting so much of himself on the line, between the records and the concerts, that when he didn’t quite break through very big you could see it was getting hard for him not to take it personally. Such a sweet guy . . . “

“Sweet guy” . . . “nice kid” . . . nobody has anything bad to say about Peter Frampton. He is extremely easy to like. An already endearing personality combined with the automatic courtesy that comes with all the second-billed years on the road have made him expertly charming. In conversation he remains light and breezy, but his personal life comes out in the albums. “I write about what happens to me,” he says. “It’s all there. I couldn’t do it any other way.” Wind of Change, for example, was a pleasant slice of life from the time of his first marriage. Frampton’s Camel was a depressing look at the marital breakup. Somethin’s Happening marked the arrival of his current girlfriend, Penny, and Frampton was a joyous testimony to their success together.

Before the now platinum Frampton Comes Alive!, none of his albums had gone beyond the 200,000 sales mark. Why the sudden fever? Peter isn’t about to question his explosion to the top: “Dylan, Chicago, Paul Simon . . . and me?” Rather, he shrugs in wonder. “I’ve figured it out,” he laughs. “There’s no way anybody could like that album and hate my guitar playing. That takes care of a lot of my insecurities.

I’ve always wanted to be the best guitarist in the world, ever since I was eight years old. Ever since I saw Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers and . . . anybody else with a Stratocaster. But between you and me, I’ll settle for just being listened to.”

However enthusiastic, Frampton is actually in the throes of his third blast of superstardom. His first came with the Herd, a short-lived and overly eulogized pop band from the ’67-’68 British boom. After years of juggling studies at Bromley Technical High School, where his father was a teacher and the pre-Bowie David Jones was a fellow student (they both played Buddy Holly songs at the school talent show), 16-year-old Peter accepted an invitation from a classmate, bassist Andrew Bown, to play lead guitar for the Heard – a welcome alternative to being packed off to music school, the preference of his parents.

The band started out playing jazz. “It was great for a while,” Peter recalls, “but even then I realized, oh-oh, I’m appearing on TV every week with my guitar slung over my back, most of the guys in the group aren’t playing on the records and I’m out there singing, which isn’t exactly what I do best. Whenever we played live, I got screamed at so much that nobody could possibly hear the guitar. That’s when I began to realize that my face could get in the way of the music.”

It did, and after a run of hit singles, the Herd was a full-fledged band with teen idols. Young Peter, with his innocent schoolboy looks, was named the Face of ’68. It drove him to alcoholism. “I joke about it now,” he says, “but it was getting pretty serious at the time. Between Bown and myself, we’d down 19 triple Scotches a night at the Marquee Club. Maybe not that much, but we never could stand up too well when we were playing. All those screaming girls – they didn’t know we were smashed. And the same guys every week for 18 months just got a bit nervy. Nervy is definitely the world. We used to reverse the numbers, do them backwards – anything to break the monotony.”

A year later, though, the Herd broke up to find they had been “royally screwed.” As minors there was little they could do about their due monies except learn a lesson. Until recently, Frampton never passed up a chance to malign his former mangers, but now his attitude has softened. “I’m tending these days not to regret anything. If it had anything to do with reaching the point I’ve reached, it was worthwhile.” Frampton laughs heartily. “And believe me, I never thought I’d be saying that.”

Although the name was coined by Steve Marriott, it was Frampton who formed Humble Pie. The two singer/guitarists had become soul mates and jamming buddies in the disillusioned months after the Herd. Steve understood. His group, the Small Faces, had gotten caught in the same teen tread mill. When Peter started forming a new band with drummer Jerry Shirley, it took less than a month for Marriott to decide he wanted in. Bringing with him ex-Spooky Tooth bassist Greg Ridley, the quartet was solidified. “It was incredible in the beginning,” Peter remembers. “Even though Steve and I were completely different in our approaches, we were really out to beat the game together. Here we were – ultraserious musicians – and both of our bands had turned into pop outfits. We all grew beards to hid our faces. All we wanted was to make it on our own terms.”

The first two Humble Pie albums suffered for exactly that reason. Giddy with their newly acquired freedom, the band wanted to do it all – rhythm & blues, folk, jazz, ballads, rock & roll. Town and Country and As Safe as Yesterday Is sold reasonably well, but in the end it became obvious that the audiences wanted only rock & roll. The more free-form elements of Pie’s stage show were hooted.

Humble Pie and Rock On, the group’s first two records for an American label, firmly established that Humble Pie had gone heavy metal, a fact that had already became obvious on their unending concert trail. A live album was recorded during a two-day stint at the Fillmore East. The minute Frampton heard the tapes, he knew The Pie would be huge. He wanted no part.

“Once again,” Peter explains, “the audience had chosen our direction. The heavy stuff . . . that always went down the best, so there we were, doing it all the time. And there was no turning back. We would have to remain that way for the remainder of the band. I was the only one in the group who really didn’t want to do that heavy riffing all the time. I don’t write those types of songs.

“So I figured I’d leave then, before the album came out. It would give them a chance to get somebody else who would be readily accepted. I mean, if there ever was a best time for leaving, that was it. So I did.”

The other members of Humble Pie found Frampton’s decision mystifying, of course, but there was little bitterness. Dave “Clem” Clempson quietly took his place and Rockin’ the Fillmore shot Humble Pie into the big leagues.

Dee Anthony, Humble Pie’s manager, retained Frampton as a client even though the artist had no immediate career plans. Peter watched his former band skyrocket while working diligently as a sessionman on George Harrison’s All Things Must Pass, Harry Nilsson’s Son of Schmilsson, John Entwistle’s Whistle Rhymes and a number of advertisement jingles.

Frampton recalls being extremely content and relaxed, taking his time about wandering back into the limelight. Fellow sessionmen volunteered their invaluable services should he choose to make a solo album. Finally, in ’72, he booked studio time and started work on his first album, Wind of Change. To Peter’s surprise, sessionmen like Billy Preston, Klaus Voorman, Nicky Hopkins, Jim Price, Bobby Keyes and Ringo Starr flocked around. It was an especially fruitful time for Frampton. Songs like “All I Want to Be (Is by  Your Side)” and It’s a Plain Shame” were written and recorded in a number of hours.

The album was well received but sold modestly (particularly in comparison to Humble Pie’s Smokin’, which had been released shortly beforehand). But after a flurry it plummeted to oblivion, leaving Frampton to map out a new strategy. It didn’t take long for him to find it. “I knew I wasn’t going to sell any records sitting at home, so . . . I took to the road.” In three days, his first tour to break into the black would open in Orlando, Florida. All the roadwork, he says, has simply managed to pay for itself. But, in fact, he’s often had to borrow money to continue his career.

“It got to the point where I couldn’t afford to borrow any more money to lose. Know what I mean? That was just before Frampton, my fourth album. As we were recording it, I was very down and depressed. At the time, the thought of a tour was a puzzle. I didn’t really want to get into any more debt. But I did. And it worked.”

Originally, it had been Peter’s third album, Somethin’s Happening, that was groomed for mass appeal. The title track would catapult him to his present status. “This is my plum,” he told an interviewer at the time. “If anything does it for me, it’s this song.”

The single bombed. Miserably. The album slunk off the charts. “Looking back, I can see the weaknesses, but watching that album fizzle out and disappear was so painful. That was the most disheartening of anything. That was the point where it was almost back to being a sessionman. I definitely thought about it.” He adds the afterthought: “Heavily.

"The minute the Frampton album came out, it all started to happen, slowly but surely." "There you have it, the album done out of desperation . . . maybe that was exactly the kind of pressure I needed."

Whatever the reason, Frampton came closest to fully capturing the artist on record. The album fell just short of gold, and a single (“Money”) did well. Frampton began headlining more regularly, playing for audiences that were more familiar with his songs.

Sensing the momentum, Frampton decided to play his trump – the live album.

“I knew it was the right thing to do,” he boasts. “I was the one in Humble Pie who wanted to do a live record. I wasn’t the only one but I was certainly the one who felt it the most. I could feel the same sort of confidence in my own career when I said, ‘Dee, let’s do it. The next one’s got to be live.’ But it was a long time between the two.”

Frampton Comes Alive! was originally meant to be another single album. “I was told to keep it to a one-record package,” Frampton recalls, “'cause the day of the double live album is gone. I agreed, you know. So I mixed and cut together the whole thing, with ‘Lines on my Face’ and ‘Do You Feel’ on one side and ‘All I Want to Be,’ ‘Something’s Happening,’ ‘It’s a Plain Shame’ and ‘Jumping Jack Flash’ on the other. That’s all.

“Then Jerry Moss [president of A&M Records] came into the studio and there was this great moment when, after I’d finished playing the single album, everybody looked at me and said, ‘Can we hear the other album?’ ” Frampton laughs. “Just another great moment in rock & roll,” he snickers. “I felt very small because . . . ‘double album?’ But, but, . . . I thought . . . I thought that you . . . one double album, coming right up. I’m happy it’s a double, obviously. I like the stuff that I didn’t think we would get to use – ‘Money’ and all the acoustic ones.

“And Jesus, I sure didn’t think I’d get such a big ‘yes, we like you’ out of the whole project.

“I enjoy playing onstage more than anything,” says Peter backstage. “It doesn’t really matter to me that I’ve probably played ever place with a stage in this country. I’ve seen a lot of tiny holes . . .”

The Orlando Sports Arena, it would be safe to say, is one of the larger holes Frampton has headlined. Tonight, the golden combination is pot and beer, as 12,000 stoned Floridians have gathered here at this glorified airplane hangar to see the first show of Peter Frampton’s current tour. Dee Anthony is here, too, having flown in just to lend support on the eve of his newest superstar’s biggest season yet.

After Gary Wright, another Anthony act, has warmed up the crowd with a set built around his current hit, “Dream Weaver,” Frampton wanders out onstage to tumultuous applause. There is a collective sigh from the many young girls in the audience. Peter looks great, still well tanned from his vacation and wearing tight green velvet pants with a white, unbuttoned shirt. “I’m not that self-conscious anymore about the way I look,” he had confided earlier, “I figure, fuck it, why deny yourself . . . “

Hit with a single spotlight, Frampton receives an acoustic guitar, seats himself on a stool at center stage and begins strumming the opening chords to “All I Want to Be (Is by Your Side).” After the applause dies down, the audience becomes as quiet as a sold-out party crowd can get. They remain miraculously respectful, booming their approval only at the end of each of several soft songs like “Do It Again One More Time,” “Penny for Your Thoughts” and “Baby, I Love Your Way.” Frampton cuts a sincere figure onstage. Fresh and vibrant in voice and action, he appears to mean it. Which makes an audience like this one feel wanted.

Even though he has always performed an extremely melodic solo act, he has only recently added the acoustic numbers to his stage show. Dee Anthony figures this is one of the big factors in Frampton’s breakthrough. “Peter has played on the bill with a lot of heavy-metal acts. They waste an audience down, physically wear them down. What is a beautiful, lovely little guy like Peter Frampton going to do when he comes out? Is he going to try to go over their energy level, saying, ‘I’m going to rock right over them?’ Of course he can’t. So we just reversed the process and started him wide open, from nothing, just acoustic guitar. And he builds. He goes in like a lamb and out like a lion.”

When Frampton straps on his black Les Paul, there is genuine hysteria. “Something’s Happening,” his first electric song of the evening, has everybody shouting the words. They roar like a football crowd.

I know it’s my year
Ain’t got no fears . . . 

There was a time, several years back, when Peter flirted with the moody pose of ever other English guitar star. Now he works the stage with the assurance of a master showman, bouncing and waving to every part of the crowd. He talks with them between numbers in a youthful, high-pitched sort of yelp, jives with the shouted requests, gets the house clapping with little effort and acts like he belongs there. “I’m not so embarrassed of the things that I say onstage as I was when I first started,” he later explains. “It’s just a matter of having the confidence to do that, which I never thought I’d get. But because the people started picking up on the music so much. I began to feel everything much more. That’s the whole story, really.”

Maybe not the whole story. The fact is that Frampton has benefited from the long hours he’s spent studying Django Reinhardt, among other guitarists. His style has sharpened and matured considerably since the early days of Humble Pie.

Grinning, Peter works his way through the meat of his set. The responses get louder with every song: “Lines on My Face,” “Show Me the Way,” “Money,” “It’s a Plain Shame” and the synthesizer-bagged tour de force “Do You Feel like We Do” – Frampton has honed these numbers into perfect stage vehicles. His solos are short and curt, the musicianship blazing.

The band – Bob May on keyboards and guitar, Stanley Sheldon on bass and John Siomos on drums – couldn’t be better. Frampton has never had a more versatile backing group. They bring to the lighter material a sophistication and to the more electric numbers a backbone. The encores, “White Sugar” and “Jumping Jack Flash,” bring the crowed to a frenzy, the entire tin venue teetering on the verge of collapse.

His face buried in a towel after the show, Frampton still can’t quite believe it all. “I know I keep going on about it,” he apologizes, “but isn’t it amazing how things can change with one album? Even a couple of months ago it was nowhere near this. Now . . . “

He is interrupted by a teenage vendor, a sneak-in from backstage. “Hey Peter, you were great. Keep it up, buddy.”

This is interesting. There is no fawning fan-to-demigod interaction. The vendor clasps Frampton’s limp playing hand for a hearty handshake. “Lemme tell ya. You really got it together for 25. All right. You got it.” It’s as if Frampton had just batted in a few runs. “Twenty-five. All right . . . “

“Almost 26,” Peter offers. “Over a quarter of a century, you know.”

“I know, pal.” The vendor slaps a hand on Frampton’s bare, sweaty back. Frampton is too stage-numb to feel it. “How long you on tour for?”

“Ever,” Peter replies without even thinking. But he quickly brightens. “I’ve got May and June off, though. Two months.”

“Outasite. You’re doing all this and you’re only 25?”

Peter nods.

“All right.” The vendor shakes his head and slips out the dressing room door. Once outside, his girlfriend has a million questions. “Did you talk to him? What’s he like?”

“Like us, if we were rock stars.” The vendor pauses. “Wendy? What the fuck am I doing selling Pepsi?”

Corinne Schwab is probably the last holdover from David Bowie's glitterglam phase — the days of Aladdin Sane, Moonage Daydream, gaudy costumes, hulking bodyguards, ex-manager Tony De Fries and the back-room-at-Max's-Kansas-City mystique. In her three years as his secretary, Corinne has watched Bowie shrewdly work up to his most difficult move yet: the switch from cultish deco rocker to a wide-appeal film and recording star/entertainer. "I want to be a Frank Sinatra figure," Bowie declares. "And I will succeed."

Wheeling a cart in a Hollywood supermarket just three blocks from where David is working on his new LP, Station to Station, Corinne says she has no doubts about something so obvious as Bowie's success in achieving his stated goal. The way she sees it, David has only one problem. "I've got to put more weight on that boy," she sighs. And with that she carefully places eight quarts of extra-rich milk in the basket.

Down the street at Cherokee Studios, David Bowie is just back from three vice-free months in New Mexico where he starred in Nick Roeg's film, The Man Who Fell to Earth. He is still glowing from the experience and, says Corinne, the healthiest he's been in years. He is relaxed and almost humble as he scoots around the studio and directs his musicians (Carlos Alomar and Earl Slick, guitars; George Murray, bass and Dennis Davis, drums) through the songs. It is a complete evolution from the David Bowie of six months before. But then, of course, anything less than a total personality upheaval would be entirely out of character for him. "I love it," he cracked several months earlier. "I'm really just my own little corporation of characters."

He is actually anything one wants him to be at any given moment — a paranoid hustler, an arrogant opportunist, a versatile actor, a gentleman, maybe even a genius. He had, after all, made a warning up front. "Don't expect to find the real me … the David Jones [his true name] underneath all this."

May 1975 — It's four in the morning, Hollywood time, and David Bowie is twitching with energy. He's fidgeting, jabbing a cigarette in and out of his pursed lips, bouncing lightly on a stool behind the control board in a makeshift demo studio, staring through the glass at Iggy Pop.

Bowie has spent the last nine hours composing, producing and playing every instrument on the backing track, and it is finally time for Pop to do his bit. After all, this is Iggy's demo.

Bowie touches a button and the room is filled with an ominous, dirgelike instrumental track. The shirtless Iggy listens intently for a moment, then approaches the mike. He has prepared no lyrics, and in the name of improv, he snarls:

You go out at night from your sixty dollar single down in West Hollywood
With your ripped off clothes that are bulging at the seams.
I can't believe that you don't know you look ugly.
I mean, are you really all that dumb?
I mean, I don't want you to be that dumb, you know.
But you are.
You're just dumb. Straight out of the cradle and into the hole with you.
He begins screaming.
When I walk through the do-wa.
I'm your new breed of who-wa.
We will nooowwwwwwwwww drink to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

Bowie clutches his heart and beams like a proud father watching his kid in the school play. His whisper is full of wonder. "They just don't appreciate Iggy." he is saying. "He's Lenny fucking Bruce and James Dean. When that adlib flow starts, there's nobody like him. It's verbal jazz, man!"

Pop himself is spent from his eruption; he listens only once to the completed cut and groggily proclaims it "the best thing I've ever done." A woman acquaintance materializes, as if on cue, to drag him out by a handful of his platinum-dyed hair.

"Go and do what you will," Bowie calls after them. "Just don't be too long. We have a lot more work to do tomorrow."

"Don't worry," Pop mumbles. "She never lets me kiss her anyway. Ever … "

"Good, Good." David adds an afterthought. "Iggy, please keep healthy."

Pop is still mumbling as he walks out the door. "I don't believe my patience," he says to no one in particular. "I just don't believe my patience. She won't even let me give her one little smooch … "

He leaves Bowie laughing, partly at the soporific antiwit, but mostly over a successful effort at producing the unproducible.

Less than a minute later, Iggy Pop is the farthest thing from his mind. Bowie's blanched, bony face has already fallen into furrows. "I am very, very bored," he says.

But he is still charged up. He jumps to his feet, skips to the next room and straps on an electric guitar. This is Bowie the rocker and the image is striking. He stands under the studio's deep blue light, dressed like a scruffy street corner newsboy from the Thirties, bashing on a bright orange instrument that perfectly matches the hair peaking out from under his cap. Over the next couple of hours, Bowie moves at breakneck speed. Before long he has written and recorded a new song and entitled it "Movin' On." Only three months before, he and John Lennon had come up with the Number One single "Fame" in only 45 minutes. "Another song," he groans. "That's the last thing I need. I write an album a month as it is. I've already got two new albums in the can. Give me a break." He is happy. It's 7 a.m. and David Bowie is finally content as he locks up the studio.

Driving a borrowed VW bug through sluggish morning traffic toward the Hollywood Hills, his eyes never stop scanning the streets. He thrills over the massage parlors, billboards and stumbling itinerants. "L.A. is my favorite museum," he says.

Bowie had fled New York by train (he does not fly) only five days earlier. After the numerous lawsuits, countersuits and injunctions over his split with manager Tony De Fries and the MainMan Companies, New York, he says, began to "close in on me." Now he is staying at the home of Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes. While Purple is on tour, he's been living there with Hughes's housekeeper, Phil. When he lets himself into the house, David finds a stranger, Phil's houseguest, drunk and half asleep on the sofa.

Bowie extends his hand tentatively. "Hello, I'm David. Who are you?"

The stranger is quickly aroused. Looking exactly as if he'd just awakened to find David Bowie standing in front of him, he pumps the hand wildly. "I'm Jack," he says. "Hey man, fucking-A great to meet you. Phil told me you were staying here too. He's asleep now … so how you fuckin' doin' anyway?"

After a quick breakfast spent dodging inquiries ("I hear you only play soul music now. That true?"), Bowie graciously explains that he's late for an appointment. He leaves the house, hops into the car and shrieks: "Oh my God, what a cretin! He's totally wrecked my nerves, that oaf! Christ!" He claims down and politely begins easing out of the planned interview — his first in more than three years. He begs exhaustion after two full days without sleep. "Why don't I just drop you off at your hotel and we can get together next week?" He has already swung into the direction of the Beverly Wilshire. "You know, I may even check myself into the hotel for a day of sleep. No one will know where I am, no one will bother me … yes, that is exactly what I'll do." At the front desk, however, he hears that guitarist Ron Wood is staying in Room 207, and Bowie decides to pay his old friend a visit. He procures a fine champagne and raps on the door.

Wood has just fallen asleep, but is glad to see Bowie nonetheless. They exchange stories on what they're up to in L.A., then settle down to listen to a cassette of the Jeff Beck Group live at Detroit's Grande Ballroom. Sprawled across the hotel room bed, Bowie is by now well into his fifth or sixth wind. And the interview is on. "Well," he asks, "what do you want to talk about?" One mentions the MainMan lawsuits.

Bowie's speech assumes a quiet, studied tone. "The split had been building up for some time. For the last year and a half, I've had no empathy with them whatsoever. It took me that long to stop touring and come back to finding out where the office was really at. I guess it was a bit hard for them to come to terms with what I wanted to do. A lot of people who I never even met got involved. I grew to dislike their attitude. So I just said goodbye. No, of course, it isn't that simple, but I'm going to make it that simple. It's not going to bother me. I'll survive. I'm far from broke. I'm free." (Reached at the New York MainMan offices, De Fries refused to comment.)

I've never been so happy," Bowie says. "I've got that good old 'I'm gonna change the world' thine back again. I had that once. I was a strong idealist once, then when I saw all my efforts being mistranslated. I turned into an avid pessimist. A manic depressive. Now I feel strong mentally again. You could probably hear from Young Americans that I'm on an upper. It's the first record I've actually liked since Hunky Dory.

"Basically I haven't liked a lot of the music I've been doing the past few years. I forgot that I'm not a musician and never have been. I've always wanted to be a film director, so unconsciously the two mediums got amalgamated. I was trying to put cinematic concepts into an audio staging. It doesn't work."

At the time, Bowie had already signed the contracts for his film debut in The Man Who Fell to Earth. Not that director Nick Roeg (whose previous credits include Far from the Madding Crowd, Walkabout, Don't Look Back and Performance) had an easy time procuring his star. David disliked the script sent him but was fascinated by the fact that Roeg had waited eight hours for him after he forgot an appointment. The two held an eight-hour conversation lasting into the next afternoon and Bowie was sold. "It didn't take long for me to realize the man was a genius. He's at a level of understanding of art that tremendously overshadows me. I was and still am in awe of Roeg. Total awe." Still, parts of the script were rewritten.

Before he fell to earth, Bowie had been reported ready to star with Elizabeth Taylor in Bluebird. "I never said that," David counters, "Elizabeth Taylor did. It was her idea for me to be doing the film. I read the script though and it was very dry. I mean she was a nice woman and all, even if I didn't get much of a chance to get to know her. She did tell me I reminded her of James Dean — that endeared me to her — but her script was so … boring. My own films are more important anyway."

Bowie has been voraciously writing screenplays and scenarios ever since his three-month Diamond Dogs tour of two years ago. His first completed script is Dogs, a film which could star Terence Stamp and Iggy Pop if Bowie can work it out. David is especially amused by his casting. "Terence is going to be Iggy's father," he titters. "Isn't that lovely? I can't wait to direct it.

"I think, you see, that the most talented actors around are all in rock & roll. Iggy never should have been a rock & roll singer, he's an actor. Dave Johansen [the former New York Doll] is an actor. A renaissance in filmmaking is going to come from rock. Not because of it, but despite it. I'll tell you, I've got nothing to do with music. I've always interpreted or played roles with my songs."

Ron Wood, who's been quietly listening all along, comes alive. "Why did you get into rock & roll, then?" he asks.

"Rock & roll is a very accessible medium for any young artist. Don't you think so? I like music but it's not my life by any stretch of the imagination. I mean I was a painter before, but as a painter I couldn't make enough money to live on. So I went into advertising and that was awful. That was the worst. I got out of that and tried rock & roll because it seemed like an enjoyable way of making my money and taking four or five years out to decide what I really wanted to do. I have no ideals on being a starving artist at all."

"Same as me," Wood chortles. "Otherwise we'd both still be in art school, eh?"

"Absolutely." Assured that Wood is an interested listener, Bowie settles into a monologue:

"It's interesting how this all started. At the time I did Aladdin Sane, all I had was a small cult audience in England from Hunky Dory. I think it was out of curiosity that I began wondering what it would be like to be a rock & roll star. So basically, I wrote a script and played it out as Ziggy Stardust onstage and on record. I mean it when I say I didn't like all those albums — Aladdin Sane, Pin Ups, Diamond Dogs, David Live. It wasn't a matter of liking them, it was 'Did they work or not?' Yes, they worked. They kept the trip going. Now. I'm all through with rock & roll. Finished. I've rocked my roll. It was great fun while it lasted but I won't do it again."

One can assume then, that Bowie is asking for a separation from the "Glitter Rock King" tag?

David is offended by the notion. "Not at all. I'm very proud of that tag. That's what the public's made me and that's what I am. Who am I to question that? I am the King of Glitter Rock, aren't I, Ron?"

"The reigning king." Wood goes to his writing desk and scribbles. "I don't like giving people tags," he cackles, "but here. For the king." He hands Bowie a $15 price tag, on the back of which he's written "King of Glitter Rock."

"Fifteen dollars!" Bowie deadpans. "Well, I guess glitter rock was always cheap anyway." A full minute is spent in laughter, then Bowie abruptly turns skittish and paranoid. "I keep drifting off." He admits to being tired. "My thought forms are already fragmented, to say the least. I've had to do ctitups on my writing for some time so that I might be able to put it all back into some coherent form again. My actual writing doesn't make a tremendous amount of sense … frankly, I'm surprised Young Americans has done so well. I really, honestly and truly, don't know how much longer my albums will sell. I think they're going to get more diversified, more extreme and radical right along with my writing. And I really don't give a shit … " Finally Bowie bows:

"Could I have a little break? I can't go on like this. Just sitting here, talking … it wears me out."

June 1975 — A straw hat cocked lazily over one eye, David is sitting cross-legged against the wall in a small, candle-lit, book-lined room. The framed cover photo from Aladdin Sane hangs above his head in direct juxtaposition. It is one of his favorite ploys — striking not only poses but whole portraits.

It's been three weeks since the last meeting, and he's moved from Hughes's house into the more centrally located Hollywood home of lawyer and former booking agent Michael Lippman. Bowie and Iggy never did make it back into the studio. Pop slept past the booked time, called up drunk several nights later and when Bowie told him to "go away" — meaning "hang up" — Iggy did just that. Now he's disappeared. "I hope he's not dead," says Bowie, "he's not a good act."

Bowie announces that he's got a new project, his autobiography. "I've still not read an autobiography by a rock person that had the same degree of presumptuousness and arrogance that a rock & roll record used to have. So I've decided to write my autobiography as a way of life. It may be a series of books. I'm so incredibly methodical that I would be able to categorize each section and make it a bleedin' encyclopedia. You know what I mean? David Bowie as the microcosm of all matter."

If the first chapter is any indication, The Return of the Thin White Duke is more telling of Bowie's "fragmented mind" than of his life story. It is a series of sketchy self-portraits and isolated incidents apparently strung together in random, probably cutout order. Despite David's enthusiasm, one suspects it may never outlast his abbreviated attention span. But it's a good idea. At 29, Bowie's life is already perfect fodder for an autobiography.

The son of a children's-home publicist, David Jones grew up prowling the tough neighborhoods in the south of London. One fistfight paralyzed his left pupil. Today, caught at a certain angle, it looks like a clear marble. Eye operations kept him prostrate for the better part of his 16th year. During the same bedridden time, his brother Terry, six years David's senior, was committed to a mental institution. It was then, he remembers, that he began to draw up the blueprint for David Bowie.

"Who knows? Maybe I'm insane too, it runs in my family, but I always had a repulsive sort of need to be something more than human. I felt very very puny as a human. I thought. 'Fuck that. I want to be a Superman.' I guess I realized very early that man isn't a very clever mechanism. I wanted to make myself better. I always thought that I should change all the time … I know for a fact that my personality now is totally different to what it was then. I took a look at my thoughts, my appearance, my expressions, my mannerisms and idiosyncrasies and didn't like them. So I stripped myself down, chucked things out and replaced them with a completely new personality. When I heard someone say something intelligent. I used it later as if it were my own. When I saw a quality in someone that I liked. I took it. I still do that. All the time. It's just like a car, man, replacing parts."

Bowie learned to apply this theory to his music. "If I'd been an original thinker. I'd never have been in rock & roll. There's no new was of saying anything."

He recalls himself as a "trendy mod" through his late teens. "I was never a flower child. Look what's happened to them with all their love and peace. They've grown up into the SLA kidnapping Patty Hearst and the like. I'd been into meditation years before it became fashionable through Kerouac and Ferlinghetti. I was always a sort of throwback to the Beat period in my early thinking. And when the hippies came along with all their funny tie-dyes and things, it all seemed naive and wrong. It didn't have a backbone. I hate weak things. I can't stand weakness. I wanted to hit everybody that came along wearing love beads.

"I never got into acid either. I did it three or four times and it was colorful, but my own imagination was already richer. I never got into grass at all. Hash for a time, but never grass. I guess drugs have been a part of my life for the past ten years, but never anything very heavy … I've had short flirtations with smack and things, but it was only for the mystery and the enigma. I like fast drugs. I hate anything that slows me down."

A high school dropout, David had already changed his name and gone through a number of pop groups when he met his wife Angela. She was the girlfriend of a Mercury Records talent scout who refused to sign David. Later, she pulled strings and he got a contract with the label. Within months he had a hit with his first single, "Space Oddity."

"I married her," David explains, "because she was one of the few women [his emphasis] that I was capable of living with for more than a week. We never suffocated each other at all. We always bounced around. No. I don't think we fell in love. I've never been in love, thank God. Love is a disease that breeds jealousy, anxiety and brute anger. Everything but love. It's a bit like Christianity. That never happened to me and Angie. She's a remarkably pleasant girl to keep coming back to and, for me, always will be. I mean, there's nobody … I'm very demanding sometimes. Not physically, but mentally. I'm very intense about anything I do. I scare away most people that I've lived with."

In 1971, the Bowies had a son, named Zowie. Having a child, Bowie says, "pleased my ego a lot. I think Zowie's a survivor. He's very definitely an independent person, of his own choosing, it seems. And I find it quite easy to think of him not as mine or as Angie's, but as Gibran has said, 'a little plant.' I don't feel very paternal about him."

Bowie adamantly states that he is still and always will be bisexual. And he will not deny that he has fully exploited the media potential of that. "I remember the first time it got out. Somebody asked me in an interview if I ever had a gay experience and I said, 'Yes, of course, I am a bisexual.' The guy didn't know what I meant. He gave me this horrified look of 'Oh my God, that means he's got a cock and a cunt.' I had no idea my sexuality would get so widely publicized. It was just a very sort of off-the-cuff little remark. Best thing I ever said, I suppose."

He returns to the subject of his autobiography: "It's not that I have anything to say, it's a matter of laying antistyle on people and making them upset. 'Who the hell is Bowie to think he deserves an encyclopedia?' But it's not what you actually put on the canvas, it's the reason why you did it. Like the Andy Warhol thing. It wasn't why he painted a Campbell's soup can. It was 'What sort of man paints a Campbell's soup can?' That's what aggravates people. That's the premise behind antistyle. And antistyle is the premise behind me.

"I already consider myself responsible for a whole new school of pretension. Really. I'm quite serious about that. The only thing that seems to shock anybody anymore is something that's pretentious or kitsch. Unless you take things to extremes nobody will believe or pay attention to you. You have to hit them on the head and pretension does the trick. It shocks as much as a Dylanesque thing did ten years ago."

Suddenly — always suddenly — David is on his feet and rushing to a nearby picture window. He thinks he's seen a body fall from the sky. "I've got to do this," he says, pulling a shade down on the window. A ballpoint-penned star has been crudely drawn on the inside. Below it is the word "Aum." Bowie lights a black candle on his dresser and immediately blows it out to leave a thin trail of smoke floating upward. "Don't let me scare the pants off you. It's only protective. I've been getting a little trouble from … the neighbors."

Something has triggered the emergence of another David Bowie — the apocalyptic theorizer in albums ranging from Ziggy to Diamond Dogs. "I think we are due for a revival of God awareness. Not a wishy-washy kind of fey, flower-child thing, but a very medieval, firm-handed masculine God awareness where we will go out and make the world right again. I'm feeling more and more that way.

Rock & roll has been really bringing me down lately. It's in great danger of becoming an immobile, sterile fascist that constantly spews its propaganda on every arm of the media. It rules and dictates a level of thought and clarity of intelligence that you'll never raise above. You don't have a fucking chance to hear Beethoven on any radio station anymore. You've got to listen to the O'Jays. I mean, disco music is great. I used disco to get my first Number One single ["Fame"] but it's an escapist's way out. It's musical soma. Rock & roll too — it will occupy and destroy you that way. It lets in lower elements and shadows that I don't think are necessary. Rock has always been the devil's music. You can't convince me that it isn't."

How about specifics? Is Mick Jagger evil?

"Mick himself? Oh Lord no. He's not unlike Elton John, who represents the token queen — like Liberace used to. No, I don't think Mick is evil at all. He represents the sort of harmless, bourgeois kind of evil that one can accept with a shrug.

"I've got this thing that rock shouldn't be overstated. I did my bit of Ziggy, I made my explosion and that's it. When the artist and song is novel and new and enigmatic, then that's good. That's when it's strong, But when it has a familiarity and understanding, it's no longer rock & roll.

"I wasn't at all surprised Aladdin Sane made my career. I packaged a totally credible plastic rock star — much better than any sort of Monkees fabrication. My plastic rocker was much more plastic than anybody's.

"I fell for Ziggy too. It was quite easy to become obsessed night and day with the character. I became Ziggy Stardust. David Bowie went totally out the window. Everybody was convincing me that I was a Messiah, especially on that first American tour. I got hopelessly lost in the fantasy. I could have been Hitler in England. Wouldn't have been hard. Concerts alone got so enormously frightening that even the papers were saying, 'This ain't rock music, this is bloody Hitler! Something must be done!' And they were right. It was awesome. Actually, I wonder … I think I might have been a bloody good Hitler. I'd be an excellent dictator. Very eccentric and quite mad.

"I was thinking a few days ago that when I got bored with films and had far too many showings in art galleries of my paintings and sculptures, maybe I should be prime minister of England. I wouldn't mind being the first English president of the United States either. I'm certainly right wing enough. Do you think Jerry would swap positions with me? I think that would be lovely, don't you?"

Chain-smoking Rothman after Rothman, Bowie is now just spilling words and concepts out without regard for their ramifications. His sole target now is impact. Shock. Effect.

"Listen, I mean it. I'll bloody lead this country, make it a great fucking nation. I can't exist happily and make records and be safe because, man, it's depressing … Everyone whimpering about the state of things. So what do I do? Just sit by and wait for someone else to sort it all out? No way. The masses are silly. Just look at the cultural leaders of today. Once they were Humphrey Bogart, James Dean and Elvis Presley. Now it's Robert Redford and John Denver … and these are supposed to be the degenerate Seventies. It doesn't look good for America. They let people like me trample all over their country.

"I have this dream. I'd like to host a satellite television show and invite all the biggest bands onto one stage. Then I'd come out with a great big wheelbarrow of machine guns and ask them, 'Now how many of you are gonna do anything? How many are going to pick up a gun and how many of you are gonna cling to your guitars?'"

Before he can pick up the thread again one feels the need to question Bowie on the seriousness of his tirades. He answers with an impatient huff that seems to ask, how much longer will it take you silly mortals to understand? "I have to carry through with my conviction that the artist is also the medium. The only way that I can be this abrasive as a person is to be this confoundedly arrogant and forthright with my point of view. I can only do that by believing in my point of view with sincerity. And I do. I honestly believe everything that I've said. I believe that rock & roll is dangerous. It could well bring about a very evil feeling in the West. I do want to rule the world. There's always a pendulum swing, right? Well, we've had the high with rock. It's got to go the other way now. And that's where I see it heading, bringing about the dark era. That we weenie boys with our makeup and funny clothes and whatnot, I feel that we're only heralding something even darker than ourselves. 'Cause we were never dark ourselves. We just bounded around the periphery. Lou [Reed] is not evil. Iggy isn't evil. There's something else. And it's evil because it supplements people's sensitivity. Just look at Led Zeppelin. Our natural inclination to be adventurous with our brains is being repressed. I don't like or approve of loud rock & roll."

That's why he broke up his backing group, the Spiders from Mars. "I gave them more life than I intended. And I was also getting honestly bored. There's only so much you can do with that kind of a band. I wanted no more to do with that loud thing. Hurt my ears. Wasn't pleasing my mind too much either. Since then, poor Mick [Ronson] has completely missed his vocation. From his faulty solo career right on down. I've been disappointed. He could have been amazing. I just don't know. Christ, I haven't spoken properly with him in years. I wonder if he's changed."

One reminds Bowie of a remark Ronson made to Melody Maker that "David needs someone around him to say 'Fuck off, you're stupid.' He needs one person who won't bow to him … "

Bowie grins. "I've got God. Who's Mick got?" He turns stern. "I promised myself I wouldn't talk about rock & roll. Now look what I've done. Let's talk about something else." He picks his appearance on the Grammy awards as the next topic. "Did you see it? It's on videotape in the next room if you didn't. You really should see it. It's only a minute. You see, the Grammies were very significant for me. It was like walking a tightrope. There were mostly aging middle-class show business people in that audience. It was a question of entertaining them or coming off like just another rock singer. I really did feel I was David Bowie and not a rock singer. It was very strange. Strange, strange, strange.

"There are very few who have broken out of rock and into any other medium, much less films. I'm determined to do it. The media should be used. You can't let it use you, which is what is happening to the majority of rock stars around. And as for touring, I honestly believe that it kills my art. I will never ever tour again."

Several months later, Bowie apparently changed his mind and announced that on February 2nd he would kick off a 34-date North American tour. "The tour," Bowie explained, "will make an obscenely large amount of money which I desperately need to set up my media-production company, Bewlay Bros."

The tour is a turnabout for Bowie; the production company is consistent with his previously stated goal of breaking the "dreaded circle" of being a star enmeshed in the music business. "I'm optimistic enough to think that of any rock singer, I've got a better chance of escaping. One person who I admire, quite honestly, is Frank Sinatra. He's broken out. He hates the fucking music business game and so do I. I refuse to play it. I've never made an album capitalizing on the success of the previous one.

"I want to be an impact on myself. I'd much rather take chances than stay safe. Like in the movie I'm doing. Everything's against me. I'm going into a dead straight, nonmusical role. No singing. And I will be bloody good. I have to be. 'Cause if I ain't, that's it. Another rock singer … is still a rock singer. If that's the case, I want to go out like Vince Taylor."

Vince Taylor?

"Yeah. He was the inspiration for Ziggy. Vince Taylor was an American rock & roll star from the Sixties who was slowly going crazy. Finally, he fired his band and went onstage one night in a white sheet. He told the audience to rejoice, that he was Jesus. They put him away." David Bowie straightens up, removes the straw hat and rakes several fingers through his orange hair.

"Think you can use any of that?"


 The advance word was "shaky." Roger Daltrey and Peter Townshend were at bitter odds. Keith Moon was looning dangerously in Los Angeles, displaying his genitalia onstage with a group of local weirdos called the Cycle Sluts. John Entwistle was already a solo touring and recording attraction. "The Who will never just fizzle out," Townshend had ofttimes been quoted as saying. "They'll go out with a huge explosion." As the band neared the beginning of an extensive American tour – their first in two years – the fuse appeared lit.

Quadromania: The Who Fuss, Fight, and Hit the Road

But the Who that bounded out onstage November 20th at Houston's 17,000-seat Summit (sold out a month before in about three hours) delivered the stunning performance of a band not about to forsake its 12-year existence. Following the band's solid one-two opening punch in "Substitute" and "I Can't Explain," a euphoric Daltrey remarked to the audience, "Those were a couple blasts from the past – '65 actually; now here's something from '75," and the band kicked into their newest single, "Squeeze Box." It was, along with an introduction to the two excerpts from Tommy, the longest stage announcement of the evening. And according to tour manager Peter Rudge, this low verbal profile is exactly the Who's strategy for survival in the Seventies.

"In the past year," Rudge explained, "this band, especially Townshend, has been very earnest in trying to explain themselves. As a result, the Who's private lives, thoughts and insecurities have been public knowledge. Now, at least for the time being, they've decided to internalize themselves. You know, Roger and Peter are closer than they've been in ten years and there's no reason to endanger that."

Translation: little stage patter and absolutely no interviews. Townshend, long regarded as rock's most accessible and articulate spokesman, explained this stance with uncharacteristic brevity: "I think it's time we give ourselves and the media a bit of a break."

As the first week of concerts wound its way through Baton Rouge, Memphis, Atlanta, Murfreesboro (Tennessee) and Hampton Roads (Virginia), the show topped itself nightly. There was no instrument demolition, but the group's legendary acrobatics  – Townshend's leaps and spins and ferocious windmill strums, Daltrey's lasso microphone, Moon's shattering drumsticks – all worked as well as ever.

Following a tumultuously received set in Memphis, Roger Daltrey paused backstage to deny previous observations made in, among other places, Rolling Stone. "I'm glad we're breaking up," Daltrey said with mock solemnity. "The band would have never found out otherwise."

Daltrey, who seems to have indoctrinated a new wave of Who fans through his appearances in the films Tommy and Lisztomania, went on to scoff at another printed rumor that the Who had rehearsed their latest album with another, more proficient drummer than Keith Moon. "There's only one Who drummer," Daltrey said. "Just one – Moon. And any story that we played with anybody else is a fucking lie."

100 Greatest Artists of All Time: the Who

On a less combative note: "This is the best tour yet. No question about it. The last American tour, when we did all of Quadrophenia, the band was using a lot of tapes. It was like they were the show and we were backup. The experience was a good one but it was deceivingly bad for our morale. It wasn't the Who that was cumbersome, it was our show at the time. The concert we do now proves that."

Daltrey went on to insist that the group has never been closer. "It's a great feeling," he said giddily, "to be standing onstage and feel the power we have. We're the best band in rock & roll. And we're going to stay there. Nothing else matters – the films, all the publicity. Just the music, that's the point of it all. That rush is too great to give up for anything. We're all incredibly happy to be back playing again."

And for tour plans beyond next month? Like in the spring? Daltrey gulped down a drink. "Just say that we'll be getting around to everybody."

I learned about sex in a laundromat. The setting wasn't my idea. It was my mother's, who had brought me along on washday to break the news. I was eight and my first thought was, "Big deal. I'd rather play with the Hot Wheels."

Ronny Miller, on the other hand, was the first kid in school to latch onto sex. While the rest of us got our thrills in saying an occasional "shit" or "asshole," Ronny was well onto "fuck," "cunt" and "pussy." He would drop straight-faced lines like "Would you ask Ann to let me borrow her cunt" and we would ask, not knowing, and she would answer, not knowing, "I don't have one." And Ronny would double up in hysterics.

But then Ronny Miller always did carry himself like he knew The Big Secret. One hot afternoon a couple of us accepted an invitation to go swimming over at the Miller house. It had the only pool in the neighborhood. Once inside his room, while we were changing into our swimsuits, Ronny finally unveiled his treasure. "Wanna see something?" he boasted.

"What?" I asked.

"Pictures."

"What kind of pictures?"

Relishing the ritual, Ronny smoothly pulled out a well-thumbed cache of pulp sheets, thinly disguised as marriage manuals. He flipped me a copy of Sexual Customs through the Ages by Somebody, Ph.D.

I immediately realized that the sex act was like nothing I had imagined. Somehow I had assumed it was a kind of medical transaction – like getting your tonsils checked – that took place in the bathroom or a doctor's office. But this was something totally different. It looked extremely uncomfortable. It looked . . . boring. My reaction was not unlike the other three guys in the room. "Big deal. Let's go swimming."

By fifth grade, things had become more interesting. Through eavesdropping on my older sister, Cindy, I was clued in to the wide world of Making Out. When she and her girlfriends locked themselves in her room to listen to Gary Lewis records and gossip about the kissing merits of their dates, I was right there listening at the door. They would chat in shrill tones for hours, belittling everyone from Billy Ragatz – the hot rodder down the street – to basketball star Dave Anderson with fantastically juicy stories of clumsy groping. ("... So he leans over and kisses me, right? With his rubbery fish lips, right? I almost had a cow. But what could I do? So he finishes, right? And he has the corn-ball stupidity to say, 'Did you feel it too?' I almost said 'What? Your fish lips? ...'")

This was more like it. All of a sudden, sex was no longer weird pictures under Ronny Miller's bed. It was intrigue. They only caught me eavesdropping once. Cindy opened the door unexpectedly and I fell inside. After that, I stuck with listening in on the extension phone.

There was one guy who my sister and her friends never ran down. Big Jim Randall, the Indio High School Rajahs' star halfback, "a real bitchin' fox." Scheming on Randall was mysteriously futile, though. Sure, he returned their awe-struck glances in the hallways but he never dated any of the girls. Some rumors had him just being too shy. Others had him secretly married to a 35-year-old woman in L.A. No question; Big Jim Randall was an enigma.

I answered the phone the afternoon he called my sister.

"Hullo. Can I talk to Cindy?" The voice was low, almost hollow.

"Who's calling?"

"It's Jim Randall."

I immediately realized the Major Historical Importance of this call. Not telling her who it was, I called Cindy to the phone. She picked up the receiver in the next room.

"Okay, I got it. Hang up, Cameron." There was no way I wasn't staying on the line for this. I made a clicking noise with my tongue. It worked.

"Hello?"

"Cindy?"

"Who's this?"

"Jim Randall."

"Hi Jim." Her nonchalance was amazing. "What's going on?"

"Well, I was trying to find you at lunch yesterday. You weren't around."

"I was in detention with Mr. Copeland."

"Oh ... no wonder." His thoughts seemed to take an extremely long time to crystallize. "Wow."

"I'm sorry I missed you," Cindy helped.

"Me, too ... listen, I just wanted to know if you felt like going to the Sun-Air tonight."

Asking a girl to the Sun-Air Drive-In on a Saturday night was about as overt as euphemisms for Making Out got. Cindy balked.

"Gee, Jim, I don't know. I don't think my parents will let me."

Silence. "That's a drag. Why don't you tell 'em you're going someplace else. Like the library or something."

"Well ... o-kay."

"And I'll pick you up there around seven."

"Okay . . ."

Being an unusually bratty younger brother, I discreetly hung up and ran into the living room to let my parents in on the scenario. When Cindy came in to tell them about her library plans for the evening, they responded by grounding her for two months. About a year after that my sister finally spoke to me again.

My mother also devised a method for cutting down on Cindy's future make-out activity. She would wait up for her to return home from a date, then closely inspect the lips and declare, "You've been kissing." This invariably ended in Cindy shrieking, "Leave me alone, you can't tell anything," and storming into her room, where she studied her own lips in amazement. "How can she tell???" To this day, my mother still won't admit to the bluff. "I can tell," she says.

For years, kissing was a complete mystery to me. First of all, wouldn't the two noses get in the way? Second, what's all this about using your tongue? Not until my seventh grade graduation party did I finally figure out the procedure. Deciding it was as good a chance as any to learn, I joined in on the customary kissing game, Spin the Bottle. When it came Sally Brown's turn to spin, I prayed that the bottle would stop in front of me. What better recipient of my first serious smooch than the girl I'd had a crush on for the entire school year. Seconds later, staring down the nozzle of a 7-Up bottle, the sudden realization struck me. I had no idea how to kiss. And I was about to make a fool in front of not only everybody else but the girl of my dreams. I would have given anybody anything to be anyplace else.

As it turns out, my first real kiss wasn't such a terrible flop. A bit awkward, yes, but not a disaster. I had made it through on instinct. And I thought she may even have liked it. I made up my mind to call her the next day and ask her to the movies. This was it. The Big L.

The next day:

"Brown household, Sally speaking."

"Hi, Sally ..."

"Hi! I was just sitting here waiting for you to call."

"You know who this is?"

"Of course."

This was too incredible. "I just thought I'd call and say 'hi,' see what you're gonna do this summer."

"Hold it," Sally cut in. "Who is this?"

"Cameron."

"Oh. Wow. I'm sorry. I thought you were somebody else. I thought you were my boyfriend there for a second."

"Your boyfriend?"

"I thought you were Ronny."

"Ronny?"

Somehow I knew what she was going to say. "Yeah, Ronny Miller. You know him?"

Our family moved out of Indio the next year and I began going to an all-boys Catholic high school in Riverside, California. Every other Friday night there were mixer dances in the gym with the neighboring all-girls school. The boys would first collect on the football field to sneak a few beers and wait until 9:30, when it was fashionably late enough to enter. The idea, of course, was that you weren't supposed to look too eager. You weren't supposed to act like you were aching to get inside that small gym with 300 girls who hadn't seen boys in two weeks.

After we were all inside and the live band swung into the first of their usual five "Proud Mary"s a night, the proceedings were always the same. Everyone paired off and climbed into the bleachers for a couple quick hours of teen lust. The real secret, though, was to climb under the bleachers, prudently. It was the only way to avoid, at the height of second-base passion, squinting into a chaperone's flashlight.

Transferring to a coed Catholic high school in San Diego for ninth grade, I soon discovered that just being a warm male body wasn't enough anymore. This was a city whose youth were still locked into a beach-blanket time warp: You had to be a surfer. Faced with the depressing realities that I didn't have blond hair and couldn't tan anyway, I had to find my niche. I began writing for the school newspaper. Twenty articles and several months later, I realized nobody read the school newspaper. So much for that.

I took my work to a staff meeting of a local underground paper, The San Diego Door, and was given a post in their music department. My first assignment was to go backstage and interview a fairly well-known San Francisco group that was opening for Fleetwood Mac that Friday night.

I decided to casually ask Karen Wilson, unquestionably the most sought-after girl in school, if she wanted to come along. She agreed. This was an ingenious power play of sexual politicizing. One date with Karen Wilson would prove that being a hodad wasn't the only way to succeed with San Diego girls.

We showed up backstage shortly after the group's set and their road manager took us to the dressing room, where the band was surrounded by friends and hangers-on. I set up my tape recorder and started asking questions. A few minutes into the interview, a rugged looking blond roadie in his mid-twenties walked into the room and began herding the extraneous people outside. "C'mon, let's go, the boys are trying to do an interview." He approached Karen. Their eyes met. "You don't have a sticker," he said. "Come with me and I'll get you the right pass." I didn't see Karen Wilson until Spanish class the following Monday morning. I played it cool, nonetheless. "What did you think of the rest of the concert?"

She giggled. "I didn't see the rest of the concert."

But I never worried about being branded a loser, for the assumption was that anybody even remotely connected with rock & roll enjoyed the sordid attentions of a world of mascara-smeared groupies. As I got more and more into rock journalism, even my parents sat me down for lectures. "Cameron, we don't expect you to ignore normal desires. Just please be careful about getting any ... diseases." It was difficult to explain to them that, on a groupie's priority scale, an interviewer of third-bill acts for an underground paper had to be somewhere between gospel singers and Sunday morning disc jockeys.

My first real confrontation came at 15. I was on the road with Lee Michaels for a few days and one night after a show I found myself in a hotel room with Lee, his drummer and about ten Seattle regulars. Everyone was quietly staring at The Midnight Special, no one saying much. After a while I turned to say something to Lee. He wasn't there. Neither was his drummer. I turned back to the television set; Steely Dan was playing "Do It Again." One of the girls leaned forward and shut the set off. "Wanna get seduced?" she asked, probably out of boredom. I laughed nervously. "I think I wanna watch Steely Dan." Trudging back to my room, I couldn't help but wonder if I had blown an opportunity that might take some time in presenting itself again. Ah well.

Not long after that, I was in L.A. to interview Rick Wakeman, then of Yes. Photographer Neal Preston, my best friend, and I were playing pool in the Beverly Hilton bar and waiting for Rick to join us. I was leaning down for a shot.

"Oh, I forgot." Neal snapped his fingers. "Remember Josie Wade?"

"Sure." Josie Wade was the attractive divorcee mother of a girl we both knew.

"She likes you. She wants you to call her up." Neal pressed her scribbled phone number into my pocket.

"C'mon." I was doing my best at pretending to concentrate on my pool game. "Willya let me play?"

"Don't believe me then," Neal shrugged. "You really should give her a call, though." He laughed and fished out of his bag a promotional picture of Keith Reid holding a silver platter. "Josie's right there for you, on a silver platter. Just like Keith Reid."

I lost the game as quickly as possible. "You'd tell me anything to win," I grumbled. "Gimme a dime, I gotta use the bathroom." I left the bar and looked for the nearest pay phone.

Hiya! This is 'Superjock' Larry Lujack! Sitting with me right here in the Super CFL Studios – straight from California – are everybody's favorite hitmakers . . . those darn Eagles!" In town for two concerts at the Arie Crown Theater, the band is visiting one of Chicago's top jocks to play, for the first time, the title track and single from One of These Nights.

"How ya doin' guys?" Lujack winks. It is guitarist/vocalist Glenn Frey, a long-time Johnny Carson aficionado whose streetwise L.A. drawl stands out from the groggy "okays" and "alrights" of the other four Eagles. "Doin' real fine, Larry," he says from behind reflector shades. "It's nice to be here at WCFL this morning."

Lujack, a world-weary Jack Nicholson lookalike, doesn't miss a beat: "Let's talk a little bit, guys, about how you got together."

"Glenn and I used to play for Linda Ronstadt and . . ."

Lujack cuts drummer Don Henley short. "Linda Ronstadt." The name rolls off his lips with lecherous abandon. "She's probably my favorite chick singer, heh-heh. Say, I remember reading somewhere that the Eagles do the best 'ooo's in the business. What do you say to that?"

"'Oooo's for bucks, Larry. That's our motto." Frey flashes a sly grin. "The only difference between boring and laid back is a million dollars."

Lujack chortles mirthlessly. "You rock & rollers are all alike, aren't you? Hey, is it true you guys want to sound like Al Green? What's the matter, you tired of being cowboys?"

"That's actually very true," Henley deadpans. "We almost called this record Black in the Saddle. . . ."

Lujack throws a hand signal to his engineer. "Okay. For the first time ever, let's listen to that new Eagles record – 'One of These Nights!' Alllriiiiiight!!!" Safely off mike, "Superjock" heaves a booming sigh. "That was a fuckin' great interview," he snickers. "Now who's got the drugs?" A few courtesy chuckles later – heh-heh and all that – the Eagles have eased out the building.

It had been an anticlimax, to be sure, but this was still a prize moment for Frey, Henley, bassist Randy Meisner and guitarists Bernie Leadon and Don Felder. After six months of work and anguish, their fourth album, One of These Nights, was finally public.

If only for perfectly capturing the feel of L.A., the Eagles are the one band that's carried on the spirit of the Buffalo Springfield. – Neil Young '75

The view from the Los Angeles hills offers a romantic and soul-searching look at Hollywood's neon glow. It's not surprising that much of One of These Nights was written under its influence. The picture is hypnotic. In the few months Don Henley and Glenn Frey have lived here – strictly for proximity's sake, they say – the two have spent many nights staring out at the "million dollar view" from their living room table and jotting down bursts of songs. Now, just one week before the band will reenter Criteria Sound Studios to record vocals and finish the album, the entire house is littered with yellow legal tablets–all of them scribbled black with abandoned or half-finished verses. "It's finals week," says Frey. "We're cramming."

The Eagles have always approached their albums cautiously. Every word and melody is considered and reconsidered before a song is deemed recordable. In the studio, the process repeats itself. "Sometimes I wonder if we don't take ourselves too seriously," Henley muses after hearing the Beatles' nonsense song "You Know My Name (Look Up My Number)" on his car radio. "Who knows, maybe Art is just a dog on Neil Young's porch. Every time I start writing one of these wonderfully sensitive songs that we write, I start wondering, 'Who really gives a shit?' Do I really give a shit? I want to do something semihumorous on one of these records someday. Something that doesn't demand so much fuckin' time and energy. We've never had an easy time making Eagles albums." This one, the followup to On the Border (which included "Best of My Love"), has been no reprieve. Bernie Leadon complains, "It seems to take more time and effort every year to forget the whole trip of touring and recording and get loose enough so that the creative juices flow naturally." Frey and Henley, in fact, already have a suggestion for a title for a story on the Eagles: "The Hardening of the Artistry."

Don Henley sits alone at the table tonight. He looks like he could be a better-looking younger brother of Mac Davis. Headphones clamped over his curls, he's sworn himself to finish the lyric to a basic track titled "After the Thrill Is Gone," or as he'd named it earlier, "Here's Another Hidden Commentary on the Music Business Disguised as a Love Song." On a cluttered oak slab before him lie all the accumulated vestiges of life as an Eagle: cassettes of outtakes, guitar picks, songbooks, gold record receipts, an Elektra/Asylum yo-yo, a copy of Time magazine's Cher cover with a SO WHAT sticker pasted over the banner and, of course, stacks of legal tablets.

In the next room, Frey is absorbed in a basketball game on TV. Chain-smoking and chugging Dos Equis, he rumbles the house with beery cries of "Willya stop the son-of-a-bitch??" and "Turg-o-vitch!!" After a while, Henley rips off the headphones and heads for the TV room in disgust, adding a new tablet to the heap. This one is blank except for two lines.

What can you do when your dreams come true 
And it's not quite like you planned

"Naw, naw, naw. . . ." The game's about over and, faced with another night at the legal pads, Frey and Henley are warming to the idea of a conversation. "There's no way it's stopped being fun, it's just . . . harder, " says Frey. "The main reason it's taking us longer to do every album is you just don't have the kind of time to collect ideas. You usually have about 20 years to work on your first album, then the media turns back around in six months and wants more. And if you've mastered a little bit of the language, your success formula tempts you every time you use it again."

"Plus," Henley continues, "it's not just a high-school game anymore. It's a fucking business. An occupation. It's a profession. And it's fuckin' hard. I'm sure nine-to-five is just as trying, but their one advantage is that they can leave it at the office. This is a 24-hour-a-day trip. It's like cramming 60 years into 28. Or, as Joe Walsh says so brilliantly, 'You burn the candle at both ends/Twice the light in half the time.' I don't know, at least we're doing what we want to be doing."

Frey: "But that gets boring and unfulfilling too. There are days when I drive to the office, drink a cup of coffee for an hour, check the mail, watch Irving [manager Irving Azoff] kill on the phone, get existential anxiety, go to the Cock 'n Bull and eat, drive to the dry cleaners, drive back up to the house, roll a joint, look out at the view and wonder what's gonna get me up to do what I want to do. That's the whole premise of 'After the Thrill Is Gone.' Where is the next stimulation?"

Henley: "Where is the next dream now that you've got this one? We were talking about this with Clive Davis the other night and he said something that's really stuck with me. Once you get comfortable, once you get most of the things you've always wanted, your universe becomes defined into a little square. Eventually you get to where you don't know what the fuck's going on outside your own little rectangle. It's like, I got up the other day and took my slide projector in to get worked on, got my camera repaired, had the car washed, got my cassette player fixed." He shrugs. "It took up the whole day."

"Servants is the answer!" Frey shouts, as if suddenly enlightened. "We should call up Abbey Rents and find someone to live for us." He pauses a moment, then turns serious. "You know that adage, 'For every dream come true, there's a curse'? One of those curses is just a lifestyle . . . it's going on all the time. When I take a look at the last year, between On the Border and this album, what have I done? Worked my ass off. You know, we went on the road, got crazy, got drunk, got high, had girls, played music and made money. If you don't watch it, that can become your whole life."

Glenn Frey, 26, and Don Henley, 28, through their crisp, quotable lyrics and interviews, are chiefly responsible for creating what one band member calls "our punky James Dean image." As a result, most journalists rarely bother to explore the band's remaining three-fifths. They would learn that for Bernie Leadon, Randy Meisner and Don Felder – all comfortably settled into secluded home and road lives – the Eagles are not quite a "24-hour-a-day trip."

Says Felder, 27, who's planning to move out of Topanga Canyon and up the coast, "I'm glad that Don and Glenn project a lot of the band's L.A./Hollywood charisma. Every group needs one and in this band we've got two people doing that. Even though Glenn's from Detroit and Don's from Texas, they really know and live the L.A. scene. It's real. It suits their personalities. Personally, I don't feel comfortable living there. I don't relate to it at all. I'd rather be alone with Susan [his wife] and Jessie [their year-and-a-half-old son]."

Nebraskan Randy Meisner, 29, is by far the most subdued of the Eagles. On his time away from the band, he is with his wife Jennifer and three children, Eric, Heather and Dana, in Mitchell, Nebraska.

Meisner, too, is content to leave the posturing to Frey and Henley – but not without reservation. "No, I don't go along with everything they say or do. For example, I'm probably the only one in the band who loves funky rock & roll, trashy music and R&B. And I don't agree with some of our images either. But Don and Glenn have it covered. I guess I'm just very shy and nervous about putting myself on the line. They're used to doing that."

Twenty-eight-year-old Bernie Leadon, the only true Southern Californian in the band, cherishes the easy anonymity of his Topanga lifestyle. He strikes one as a commercially successful musician with a purist's guilty conscience. He admits to twice leaving and rejoining the Eagles. His previous bands were Flying Burrito Brothers and Dillard and Clark, both critically raved and financially starved.

"My attitude toward the band is pretty good these days. We've all grown a lot. Everybody realizes this is a good opportunity to get some bucks ahead and also, man, I think the music is worth something. There's so much bullshit in the pop world. So much of it is just lower-chakra music. No finesse. It's just sexually oriented. That's a form of escape. I like to think our band is more than that. That there's some thought, some living behind it. In the meantime, I just don't want to succumb to the comforts of an affluent society and say, 'Okay, this is swell, I give in.' "

Leadon, given to T-shirts and jeans, thinks concerts have been reduced to "business transactions." And he despises limousines: "It feels like you're thumbing your nose at your audience." He succumbs and rides the limos but escapes to the beach whenever he can. "To me, sun and salt water is where it's at. That, a little wine, a little music and my old lady...that's it. That's all that matters."

Glenn Frey glibly writes off these crosscurrents of personalities, lifestyles and directions as the Eagles' vital force – creation tension. "We're the Oakland As of rock & roll," he says. "On the field, we can't be beat. But in the clubhouse, well, that's another story. Sure, Don and I are more into it than the others. We're completely different people. We rarely even hang out together.

"Sometimes I wonder if the other guys in the band know how much I like them. How much of a foundation they are. We never even talk about it. We each have our own spaces. We play sometimes and we fight sometimes. I get so caught up in all this – the pressures of being Glenn Frey of the Eagles, the guy who talks a lot – that if Randy or Bernie needed some confidence building, I might be too self-involved to realize it. I worry about that. But even though there's a keg of dynamite that's always sitting there, this band is fairly together."

Frey is on the edge of his seat now, eager to make his point. "I just figure we can't lose. The longer the Eagles stay together, the better it's gonna be. No matter what. We never expected to get this far, anyway. I thought we'd break up after our first album."

Still there is a predestined aura about their success, a feeling that maybe even the tension was plotted. Onstage, they wear their recently attained superstar status with the nonchalance of a band always geared to go all the way.

The story begins in Detroit, where a sunken-eyed, girl-crazy guitar player named Glenn Frey began popping up in various local bands like the Mushrooms, the Subterraneans and the Four of Us. "He knew he was cool. He was really into this whole role of being a teen king," one girl remembers him. "He took my sister out once and tried to feel her up. She didn't let him, so he brought her home early and never called her again." At the time, his mother had another theory. "Glenn," she remembers telling him, "your life revolves around groups of people. You can't relate that well to individuals. If your guitar had tits and an ass, you'd never date another girl." Frey smiles. "That was really true," he says. "I've had long talks about that with her since."

These days, Glenn is anxious to play down his jack-rabbit adolescence. "I read something that really made me think. It was an interview Jules Feiffer did for – oddly enough – Playboy. He said, 'Remember when you were 11 years old and girls were a drag. The only thing that was cool was playing Army and recess and dodge ball. The big mistake that men make is that when they turn 13 or 14, and all of a sudden they've reached puberty, they believe that they like women. Actually, you're just horny. It doesn't mean that you like women any more at 21 than you did at ten.' That's strong shit. I read that and thought of all the guys I've heard say, 'I fucked the shit out of her.' It made me realize that the real test for a man is learning to respect and like women." Frey's on-the-road womanizing days are over, he believes. "I want to settle down," he says. "A whole lot."

After a brief apprenticeship with Bob Seger (Frey sang backup on "Ramblin' Gamblin' Man"), Glenn left college and made his big move to L.A. Why not New York, which was closer? "Well, the truth was that I was gonna buy drugs in Mexico and see a girlfriend who moved out here with her sister. My parents told me that if I was going to California, they weren't gonna give me a goddamn dime. They would send me five bucks/ten bucks in every letter. 'Buy yourself a nice breakfast and a pack of cigarettes.' I send them money now. That's the big get-off about money. Doing things for other people. I'm paying for my brother's college education.

"But anyway, the whole vibe of L.A. hit me right off. The first day I got to L.A., I saw David Crosby sitting on the steps of the Country Store in Laurel Canyon, wearing the same hat and green leather bat cape he had on for Turn! Turn! Turn! To me, that was an omen. I immediately met J.D. Souther, who was going with my girlfriend's sister, and we really hit it off. It was definitely me and him against whatever else was going on."

Souther and Frey formed a duo, Longbranch Pennywhistle, and recorded an album on Amos Records. Eventually they split up with their girlfriends and, on the advice of Jackson Browne, moved into his $60-a-month upstairs apartment in Echo Park. "So the three of us were all living there, listening to records or to Jackson. I'd just lay in bed and hear him practice downstairs. The piano was right below my bed. Those were great times.

"Then one day J.D. and I got in a fight with our record company and suddenly we couldn't make any more records. Every day we'd go to the office, ask if we could get released from our contracts and they'd say no, so we'd go down to the Troubadour bar and get drunk. The Troubadour, man, was and always will be full of tragic fucking characters. Has-beens and hopefuls. Sure, it's brought a lot of music to people but it's also infested with spiritual parasites who will rob you of your precious artistic energy. I was always worried about going down there because I thought people would think I had nothing better to do. Which was true."

Don Henley, drummer and lead singer in a band named Shiloh (also on Amos Records), never spoke to Frey when they saw each other in the bar. "I just thought Glenn was another fucked up little punk." Henley had also just made his move to L.A. Behind him were four years of college and Linden, a Texas town (population 2000) where he was the weird hippie. "In a town that size," he says, "all you can do is dream. I had this one English teacher who really turned my head around. He was way out of place in this little college. This bohemian, the first one I'd ever seen. He'd come to class in these outrageous clothes and lecture cross-legged on top of his desk. One day he told me, 'Your parents are asking me what your future career plans are. I know there's a lot of pressure on you to decide.' Then he said something I never forgot. 'Frankly, if it takes you your whole fucking life to find out what it is you want to do, you should take it. It's the journey that counts, not the end of it. That's when it's all over.' " And Don was off. His mother and dying father not only wished him well but supported him in his first year of scuffling.

Frey was first to break into one of Hollywood's royal rock circles. "I had just played a couple of songs for David Geffen, the guy who managed Joni and CSNY – the people I wanted to be with," he recalls. "Geffen told me point blank that I shouldn't make a record by myself and that maybe I should join a band. Then Linda Ronstadt hired me. It was two days before rehearsal was supposed to start and they still hadn't found a drummer. And here was Henley, just standing right in the Troubadour. So I struck up a conversation with him. I told him my whole trip was just stalled. I had all these songs and couldn't make a record and I wanted to put together a band, but I was going on the road with Linda. Henley said that he was fucked up too. Al Perkins had left Shiloh to join the Burritos and . . . we were both at impasses. So he joined Linda's group too. The first night of our tour, we decided to start a band."

But not just another L.A. band. "We had it all planned. We'd watched bands like Poco and the Burrito Brothers lose their initial momentum. We were determined not to make the same mistakes. This was gonna be our best shot. Everybody had to look good, sing good, play good and write good. We wanted it all. Peer respect. AM and FM success. Number One singles and albums, great music and a lot of money.

"Money," Henley reasons, "was a much saner goal than adoration. They'll both drive you crazy but if I'm gonna blow my brains out for five years, I want something to show for it."

John Boylan, Linda Ronstadt's manager/producer, was the first to come up with the combination of Frey, Henley, Meisner and Leadon. His idea was to form a five-piece supergroup to back Linda. "We all thought, 'Yeah, great, but why don't we just put together a supergroup to back each other up,'" says Don. "John and Linda gave us our blessing. I really respect Linda Ronstadt. She's got a good heart. She's never been selfish enough to hold anybody back."

Frey, now with the Eagles, made his triumphant return to David Geffen's office without even a demo tape. As the group's father figure/leader in its first year, Bernie did all the talking. "Geffen had no idea what we sounded like," Henley recounts. "And here comes Bernie walking in saying, 'Okay, here we are. Do you want us or not.' It was a great moment. Geffen kinda said, 'Well . . . yeah.' A lot of credit has to go to Jackson, who convinced David we were good. Geffen himself couldn't carry a tune in an armored car. Still, he kept us alive while we got some songs together and rehearsed by playing four sets a night in a club in Aspen." The music was rocking blues and their show included Sonny Boy Williamson's "Pontiac Blues" and an R&B-tinged version of "Take It Easy," Jackson Browne's song from the Echo Park days. Geffen eased Frey out of his contract and fronted the band $125,000 and they went to London to record their first album for Asylum Records, produced by Glyn Johns.

It was Johns who reshaped this bar band into "the country-rock band with those high-flyin' harmonies," as their bios keep saying. "He was the key to our success in a lot of ways," Glenn admits. "He'd been working with all these classic English rock & roll bands . . . the Who, the Stones . . . he didn't want to hear us squashing out Chuck Berry licks. I didn't mind him pointing us in a certain direction. We just didn't want to make another limp-wristed L.A. country-rock record. They were all too smooth and glassy. We wanted a tougher sound."

By all accounts, Johns, known as kind of a school-marm in the studio, led the Eagles by the nose through their first album, camp-counselor style.

"Glyn made us very aware of all the little personal trips within the band," says Henley. "He'd just stare at you with his big, strong, burning blue eyes and confront you with the man-to-man talk. You couldn't help but get emotional. We even cried a couple times. . . ."

Frey: "He'd say, 'You're a fine singer, a fine guitar player, a great asset to this band. . . .' "

Henley: " 'But you're being an asshole.' "

One of Johns's strictest studio rules – no drugs – held fast. "It really irritated him," says Frey, "that Randy and I would sneak off and smoke weed. He'd tell me, 'You smoke grass and then you don't say what's on your mind when it comes to mind. Now it's a week later and you're talking about something you should have ironed out seven days ago. And that's juvenile . . .' What can you say? You're busted. It's true. He pointed out a lot of bad habits in everybody. It's hard to be friends with someone who does that to you. It's like a basic premise for friendship is that you accept the threat that everybody else poses to you."

If Eagles was the perfect attention getter (it produced three hit singles, "Take It Easy," "Witchy Woman" and "Peaceful Easy Feeling"), Desperado established the Eagles' credibility. The album's low-key concept, that the rock & roll life is not unlike an out-law's, was an idea Henley, Frey, Browne, Souther and Ned Doheny had kicked around for years. Even today, they pipe dream about a screen adaptation.

Though the Eagles agree that it's probably their finest effort, Desperado was the scene of the battle that the group still fights every time they enter the studio. "The only two people in this group who tend to think alike are Glenn and me," explains Henley, "and we've always wanted every song to be the best that it could be. We didn't want any filler. No stinkers. So there's been plenty of fights even with Glyn Johns over 'Aww, you guys just want to rewrite all the lyrics.' That's not true. We don't disagree with anything anybody in the band has to say, it's just how they say it. When somebody hears a bad song, they're not gonna say, 'So-and-so wrote a weak song.' They're gonna say, 'There's a shitty song on the Eagles album.' It reflects on everybody. Still, I suppose it's a matter of taste."

Frey cuts in, "I asked Graham Nash once, 'In CSNY did you ever change any of the other guys' lyrics?' He said, 'No, never. Why, do you do that?' I said 'yeah' and he kinda looked shocked. I just think it's part of the band trip. All these legal pads don't make me feel heavy. It just makes me feel like I've got a lot of work to do."

"Glenn is not a great guitar player and I'm not a great drummer," says Henley. "On the other hand, Randy, Bernie and Felder are incredible on their instruments. We've just taken it upon ourselves that this is our department. Maybe we're full of shit but I think we've proven ourselves. We recognize the fact that those guys have got a need to say something and if we can help them say it better, then I think everybody's better off. It's not a matter of credit or money or any of that stuff. We've been splitting the publishing equally from the beginning.

"All the fighting reached a culmination point on On the Border. That's when we didn't finish the album in London with Glyn Johns. We came back with two songs, "You Never Cry like a Lover" and "Best of My Love," and finished in L.A. with Bill [Szymczyk]. Glenn and I assumed this bulldozer attitude before we went into the studio of, 'We ain't gonna put up with any weaknesses. Every song's gonna be great.' There was a lot of fighting. Don Felder, who we just added to the band in the middle of the album, was so scared he'd joined a band that was breaking up."

Frey and Henley, it would be safe to say, are the band's primary students of the music business. They devour all the trade magazines, reading sales figures and interview features like most businessmen read Wall Street Journal. "You can't be sensitive artiste all the time," says Henley. "You have to be able to fend for yourself. I don't want to be like the Fifties superstars, walking around now completely broke and trying to make a comeback." Henley and Frey were also the main engineers behind the band's leaving Geffen-Roberts Management in favor of Irving Azoff, himself a former employee of Geffen and Elliott Roberts.

"It's the old sauna story," says Henley. "Jackson, J.D., Ned and Glenn were at David Geffen's house just down the street one day and he said, 'I want to keep Asylum Records really small. I'll never have more artists than I can fit in this sauna.' Then, all of a sudden, he was signing people right and left.

"Then Geffen just split the management scene entirely and became a record company president, turning the whole thing over to Elliott Roberts and John Hartmann. It wasn't the same after that. Elliott's insights were great but he'd been through all that stuff with Joni and Neil and Crosby and all those guys. Finding the right manager is kinda like finding the right girl. When you finally get the perfect one, you want one that's your own age and has been through the same trip you have. We were always the young guys down there. Nobody paid much attention to us. We found out our management company had signed Poco and America by reading Melody Maker."

Azoff, 26, formed his own management firm, Frontline, at the insistence of the Eagles and two other artists he had developed a close relationship with, Joe Walsh and Dan Fogelberg. Azoff, referred to by the Eagles as "your shortness" (he's 5'3"), has acquired a reputation of sorts because of his showboat business methods. "I think it's great to have someone pounding on record company desks saying, 'Fuck you, you're not getting another Eagles album,' " says Frey. "When we first met Irving, we had two gold records and $2500 in the bank. Now we each make a half-million dollars every year and see every penny.

"Getting Irving was like catching Geffen on the upswing six years ago." Sure enough, Azoff, along with Fogelberg and Walsh, has already put together his own label, Full Moon, on Epic. An affiliation with Jerry Weintraub, the concert promoter/ manager of John Denver, Moody Blues and Frank Sinatra, is in the works. But, he says, "managing the Eagles will always be my top priority. Always."

Asked about the present Eagles game plan, Don Henley plucks up an acoustic guitar and strums absentmindedly. "We definitely believe in maintaining the underdog status," he decides. Frey is slowly, deliberately nodding his head.

"Mass appeal is definitely suspect. Just look at our Grammy winners, Stevie Wonder excluded. Sometimes all that mass appeal means is that you simplified your equation down to the lowest common denominator. It's a great temptation to think, 'Well, fuck it, they'll buy this. No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the mass public.' Bless H.L. Mencken's heart. He's absolutely right but, see, I don't want that kind of karma. That must be weird shit, to sell a bunch of records and make a bunch of money off something that didn't mean a fuckin' thing. I don't ever want to face that."

Henley: "It's not a sin to be in the Top 40. Look at Paul Simon and Joni. They sell millions of records."

Frey: "I'm looking to Joni and Paul Simon and Randy Newman as living proof to us that you can still be doing it in your 30s. I get my confidence by watching them. I realize I can still do it when I'm 32, if I keep my perspective. If I don't overamp and die from success poisoning. This business is like walking through a mine field. They's why people who envy me look foolish. They don't see me at the Record Plant, trying all night to get one vocal. As far as they know, I'm just a guy who's drunk down in Tana's one night a week."

"I'm beginning to feel kind of proud that we've gone through three albums," says Henley. "I'm beginning to feel like a trooper, like we've finally got a place in the big rock pile, as it were. The important question now, though, is will we make a better album than the last one. Knowing full well that, whatever we do, it'll be gold in three or four weeks."

There is a reflective silence around the table, as if Henley has struck the quick of the matter. Frey finishes the last of his beer and set the bottle down with a loud clunk. "Well, you can clock me in at 5 a.m." He squints at his watch. "Good night."

The Eagles return from a record crowd at the Chicago Stadium to find their Holiday Inn's front desk covered with phone messages, telegrams and flowers. With One of These Nights in its fifth week at the top of Billboard's LP chart, the group has just won in Best Song ("Best of My Love") and Best Group (over Led Zeppelin, Elton John and the Rolling Stones) categories of the nationally televised Rock Awards. On the phone upstairs with Glenn Frey is Joe Walsh, who accepted the awards for them and, in the process, kissed presenter Raquel Welch.

"You really kissed her," Glenn is demanding, eyes wide. "Did you ask her about the silicone?" He spots the writer going for his notebook. "Naw, naw, naw. Don't use that. That's a cruel remark. Besides, we can't be roguish underdogs anymore." Frey grins and flips a cigarette into his mouth. "We have to be gracious winners."

 Nearing 30, Neil Young is the most enigmatic of all the superstars to emerge from Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. His often cryptic studies of lonely desperation and shaky-voiced antiheroics have led many to brand him a loner and a recluse. Harvest was the last time that he struck the delicate balance between critical and commercial acceptance, and his subsequent albums have grown increasingly inaccessible to a mass audience.

Young's first comprehensive interview comes at a seeming turning point in his life and career. After an amicable breakup with actress Carrie Snodgrass, he's moved from his Northern California ranch to the relative hustle and bustle of Malibu. In the words of a close friend, he seems "frisky...in an incredible mood." Young has unwound to the point where he can approach a story about his career as potentially "a lot of fun."

The interview was held while cruising down Sunset Boulevard in a rented red Mercedes and on the back porch of his Malibu beach house. Cooperative throughout, Young only made a single request: "Just keep one thing in mind," he said as soon as the tape recorder had been turned off for the last time. "I may remember it all differently tomorrow."

Why is it that you've finally decided to talk now? For the past five years journalists requesting Neil Young interviews were told you had nothing to say.
There's a lot I have to say. I never did interviews because they always got me in trouble. Always. They never came out right. I just don't like them. As a matter of fact, the more I didn't do them the more they wanted them; the more I said by not saying anything. But things change, you know. I feel very free now. I don't have an old lady anymore. I relate it a lot to that. I'm back living in Southern California. I feel more open than I have in a long while. I'm coming out and speaking to a lot of people. I feel like something new is happening in my life.

I'm really turned on by the new music I'm making now, back with Crazy Horse. Today, even as I'm talking, the songs are running through my head. I'm excited. I think everything I've done is valid or else I wouldn't have released it, but I do realize the last three albums have been a certain way. I know I've gotten a lot of bad publicity for them. Somehow I feel like I've surfaced out of some kind of murk. And the proof will be in my next album. Tonight's the Night, I would say, is the final chapter of a period I went through.

Why the murky period?
Oh, I don't know. Danny's death probably tripped it off. Danny Whitten [leader of Crazy Horse and Young's rhythm guitarist/second vocalist]. It happened right before the Time Fades Away tour. He was supposed to be in the group. We [Ben Keith, steel guitar; Jack Nitzche, piano; Tim Drummond, bass; Kenny Buttrey, drums; and Young] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. "It's not happening, man. You're not together enough." He just said, "I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?" And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and...insecure.

Why, then, did you release a live album?
I thought it was valid. Time Fades Away was a very nervous album. And that's exactly where I was at on the tour. If you ever sat down and listened to all my records, there'd be a place for it in there. Not that you'd go there every time you wanted to enjoy some music, but if you're on the trip it's important. Every one of my records, to me, is like an ongoing autobiography. I can't write the same book every time. There are artists that can. They put out three or four albums every year and everything fucking sounds the same. That's great. Somebody's trying to communicate to a lot of people and give them the kind of music that they know they want to hear. That isn't my trip. My trip is to express what's on my mind. I don't expect people to listen to my music all the time. Sometimes it's too intense. If you're gonna put a record on at 11:00 in the morning, don't put on Tonight's the Night. Put on the Doobie Brothers.

Time Fades Away, as the followup to Harvest, could have been a huge album . . .
If it had been commercial.

As it is, it's one of your least selling solo albums. Did you realize what you were sacrificing at the time?
I probably did. I imagine I could have come up with the perfect followup album. A real winner. But it would have been something that everybody was expecting. And when it got there they would have thought that they understood what I was all about and that would have been it for me. I would have painted myself in the corner. The fact is I'm not that lone, laid-back figure with a guitar. I'm just not that way anymore. I don't want to feel like people expect me to be a certain way. Nobody expected Time Fades Away and I'm not sorry I put it out. I didn't need the money, I didn't need the fame. You gotta keep changing. Shirts, old ladies, whatever. I'd rather keep changing and lose a lot of people along the way. If that's the price, I'll pay it. I don't give a shit if my audience is a hundred or a hundred million. It doesn't make any difference to me. I'm convinced that what sells and what I do are two completely different things. If they meet, it's coincidence. I just appreciate the freedom to put out an album like Tonight's the Night if I want to.

You sound pretty drunk on that album.
I would have to say that's the most liquid album I've ever made. [Laughs] You almost need a life preserver to get through that one. We were all leaning on the ol' cactus...and, again, I think that it's something people should hear. They should hear what the artist sounds like under all circumstances if they want to get a complete portrait. Everybody gets fucked up, man. Everybody gets fucked up sooner or later. You're just pretending if you don't let your music get just as liquid as you are when you're really high.

Is that the point of the album?
No. No. That's the means to an end. Tonight's the Night is like an OD letter. The whole thing is about life, dope and death. When we [Nils Lofgren, guitars and piano, Talbot, Molina and Young] played that music we were all thinking of Danny Whitten and Bruce Berry, two close members of our unit lost to junk overdoses. The Tonight's the Night sessions were the first time what was left of Crazy Horse had gotten together since Danny died. It was up to us to get the strength together among us to fill the hole he left. The other OD, Bruce Berry, was CSNY's roadie for a long time. His brother Ken runs Studio Instrument Rentals, where we recorded the album. So we had a lot of vibes going for us. There was a lot of spirit in the music we made. It's funny, I remember the whole experience in black and white. We'd go down to S.I.R. about 5:00 in the afternoon and start getting high, drinking tequila and playing pool. About midnight, we'd start playing. And we played Bruce and Danny on their way all through the night. I'm not a junkie and I won't even try it out to check out what it's like...but we all got high enough, right out there on the edge where we felt wide-open to the whole mood. It was spooky. I probably feel this album more than anything else I've ever done.

Why did you wait until now to release 'Tonight's the Night'? Isn't it almost two years old?
I never finished it. I only had nine songs, so I set the whole thing aside and did On the Beach instead. It took Elliot [manager Elliot Roberts] to finish Tonight's the Night. You see, awhile back there were some people who were gonna make a Broadway show out of the story of Bruce Berry and everything. They even had a script written. We were putting together a tape for them and in the process of listening back on the old tracks, Elliot found three even older songs that related to the trip, "Lookout Joe," "Borrowed Tune" and "Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown," a live track from when I played the Fillmore East with Crazy Horse. Danny even sings lead on that one. Elliot added those songs to the original nine and sequenced them all into a cohesive story. But I still had no plans whatsoever to release it. I already had another new album called Homegrown in the can. The cover was finished and everything, [laughs] Ah, but they'll never hear that one.

Okay. Why not?
I'll tell you the whole story. I had a playback party for Homegrown for me and about ten friends. We were out of our minds. We all listened to the album and Tonight's the Night happened to be on the same reel. So we listened to that too, just for laughs. No comparison.

So you released 'Tonight's the Night.' Just like that?
Not because Homegrown wasn't as good. A lot of people would probably say that it's better. I know the first time I listened back on Tonight's the Night it was the most out-of-tune thing I'd ever heard. Everyone's off-key. I couldn't hack it. But by listening to those two albums back to back at the party, I started to see the weaknesses in Homegrown. I took Tonight's the Night because of its overall strength in performance and feeling. The theme may be a little depressing, but the general feeling is much more elevating than Homegrown. Putting this album out is almost an experiment. I fully expect some of the most determinedly worst reviews I've ever had. I mean if anybody really wanted to let go, they could do it on this one. And undoubtedly a few people will. That's good for them, though. I like to see people make giant breakthroughs for themselves. It's good for their psyche to get it all off their chests, [laughs] I've seen Tonight's the Night draw a line everywhere it's been played. People who thought they would never dislike anything I did fall on the other side of the line. Others who thought "I can't listen to that cat. He's just too sad,"or whatever..."His voice is funny." They listen another way now. I'm sure parts of Homegrown will surface on other albums of mine. There's some beautiful stuff that Emmylou Harris sings harmony on. I don't know. That record might be more what people would rather hear from me now, but it was just a very down album. It was the darker side to Harvest. A lot of the songs had to do with me breaking up with my old lady. It was a little too personal...it scared me. Plus, I had just released On the Beach, probably one of the most depressing records I've ever made. I don't want to get down to the point where I can't even get up. I mean there's something to going down there and looking around, but I don't know about sticking around.

You didn't come from a musical family . . . 
Well, my father played a little ukulele. [Laughs] It just happened. I felt it. I couldn't stop thinking about it. All of a sudden I wanted a guitar and that was it. I started playing around the Winnipeg community clubs, high school dances. I played as much as I could.

With a band?
Oh yeah, always with a band. I never tried it solo until I was 19. Eighteen or 19.

Were you writing at the time?
I started off writing instrumentals. Words came much later. My idol at the time was Hank B. Marvin, Cliff Richard's guitar player in the Shadows. He was the hero of all the guitar players around Winnipeg at the time. Randy Bachman too; he was around then, playing the same circuit. He had a great sound. Used to use a tape repeat.

When did you start singing?
I remember singing Beatles tunes...the first song I ever sang in front of people was "It Won't Be Long" and then "Money (That's What I Want)." That was in the Calvin High School cafeteria. My big moment.

How much different from the States was growing up in Canada?
Everybody in Canada wants to get to the States. At least they did then. I couldn't wait to get out of there because I knew my only chance to be heard was in the States. But I couldn't get down there without a working permit, and I didn't have one. So eventually I just came down illegally and it took until 1970 for me to get a green card. I worked illegally during all of the Buffalo Springfield and some of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I didn't have any papers. I couldn't get a card because I would be replacing an American musician in the union. You had to be real well known and irreplaceable and a separate entity by yourself. So I got the card after I got that kind of stature--which you can't get without fucking being here...the whole thing is ridiculous. The only way to get in is to be here. You can't be here unless it's all right for you to be here. So fuck it. It's like 'throw the witch in the water and if it drowns it wasn't a witch. If it comes up, it is a witch and then you kill it.' Same logic. But we finally got it together

Did you know Joni Mitchell in those days?
I've known Joni since I was 18. I met her in one of the coffeehouses. She was beautiful. That was my first impression. She was real frail and wispy looking. And her cheekbones were so beautifully shaped. She'd always wear light satins and silks. I remember thinking that if you blew hard enough, you could probably knock her over. She could hold up a Martin D18 pretty well, though. What an incredible talent she is. She writes about her relationships so much more vividly than I do. I use...I guess I put more of a veil over what I'm talking about. I've written a few songs that were as stark as hers. Songs like "Pardon My Heart," "Home Fires," "Love Art Blues"...almost all of Homegrown. I've never released any of those. And I probably never will. I think I'd be too embarrassed to put them out. They're a little too real.

How do you look back on the whole Buffalo Springfield experience?
Great experience. Those were really good days. Great people. Everybody in that group was a fucking genius at what they did. That was a great group, man. There'll never be another Buffalo Springfield. Never. Everybody's gone such separate ways now, I don't know. If everybody showed up in one place at one time with all the amps and everything, I'd love it. But I'd sure as hell hate to have to get it together. I'd love to play with that band again, just to see if the buzz was still there.

There's a few stock Springfield myths I should ask you about. How about the old hearse story?
True. Bruce and I were tooling around L.A. in my hearse. I loved the hearse. Six people could be getting high in the front and back and nobody would be able to see in because of the curtains. The heater was great. And the tray...the tray was dynamite. You open the side door and the tray whips right out onto the sidewalk. What could be cooler than that? What a way to make your entrance. Pull up to a gig and just wheel out all your stuff on the tray. Anyway, Bruce and I were taking in California. The Promised Land. We were heading up to San Francisco. Stephen and Richie Furay, who were in town putting together a band, just happened to be driving around too. Stephen had met me before and remembered I had a hearse. As soon as he saw the Ontario plates, he knew it was me. So they stopped us. I was happy to see fucking anybody I knew. And it seemed very logical to us that we form a band. We picked up Dewey Martin for the drums, which was my idea, four or five days later. Stephen was really pulling for Billy Munday at the time. He'd say 'Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dewey's good, but Jesus...he talks too fucking much.' I was right though. Dewey was fucking good.

How much has the friction between you and Stills been beneficial over the years?
I think people really have that friction business out of hand. Stephen and I just play really good together. People can't comprehend that we both can play lead guitar in the band and not fight over it. We have total respect for musicianship and we both bring out the perfectionist in each other. We're both very intense, but that's part of our relationship. We both enjoy that. It's part of doing what we do. In that respect being at loggerheads has worked to our advantage. Stephen Stills and I have made some incredible music with each other. Especially in the Springfield. We were young. We had a lot of energy.

Why did you leave the band?
I just couldn't handle it toward the end. My nerves couldn't handle the trip. It wasn't me scheming on a solo career, it wasn't anything but my nerves. Everything started to go too fucking fast, I can tell that now. I was going crazy, you know, joining and quitting and joining again. I began to feel like I didn't have to answer or obey anyone. I needed more space. That was a big problem in my head. So I'd quit, then I'd come back 'cause it sounded so good. It was a constant problem. I just wasn't mature enough to deal with it. I was very young. We were getting the shaft from every angle and it seemed like we were trying to make it so bad and were getting nowhere. The following we had in the beginning, and those people know who they are, was a real special thing. It gave all of us, I think, the strength to do what we've done. With the intensity that we've been able to do it. Those few people who were there in the very beginning.

Last Springfield question. Are there, in fact, several albums of unreleased material?
I've got all of that. I've got those tapes.

Why have you sat on them for so long? What are you waiting for?
I'll wait until I hear from some of the other guys. See if anybody else has any tapes. I don't know if Richie or Dicky Davis [Springfield road manager] has anything. I've got good stuff. Great songs. "My Kind of Love," "My Angel," "Down to the Wire," "Baby Don't Scold Me." We'll see what happens.

What was your life like after the Springfield?
It was all right. I needed to get out to the sticks for a while and just relax. I headed for Topanga Canyon and got myself together. I bought a big house that overlooked the whole canyon. I eventually got out of that house because I couldn't handle all the people who kept coming up all the time. Sure was a comfortable fucking place... that was '69, about when I started living with my first wife, Susan. Beautiful woman.

Was your first solo album a love song for her?
No. Very few of my albums are love songs to anyone. Music is so big, man, it just takes up a lot of room. I've dedicated my life to my music so far. And every time I've let it slip and gotten somewhere else, it's showed. Music lasts...a lot longer than relationships do. My first album was very much a first album. I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. And I did, thanks to the wonder of modern machinery. That first album was overdub city. It's still one of my favorites though. Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere is probably my best. It's my favorite one. I've always loved Crazy Horse from the first time I heard the Rockets album on White Whale. The original band we had in '69 and '70--Molina, Talbot, Whitten and me. That was wonderful. And it's back that way again now. Everything I've ever done with Crazy Horse has been incredible. Just for the feeling, if nothing else.

Why did you join CSNY, then? You were already working steadily with Crazy Horse.
Stephen. I love playing with the other guys, but playing with Stephen is special. David is an excellent rhythm guitarist and Graham sings so great...shit, I don't have to tell anybody those guys are phenomenal. I knew it would be fun. I didn't have to be out front. I could lay back. It didn't have to be me all the time. They were a big group and it was easy for me. I could still work double time with Crazy Horse. With CSNY, I was basically just an instrumentalist that sang a couple of songs with them. It was easy. And the music was great. CSNY, I think, has always been a lot bigger thing to everybody else than it is to us. People always refer to me as Neil Young of CSNY, right? It's not my main trip. It's something that I do every once in a while. I've constantly been working on my own trip all along. And now that Crazy Horse is back in shape, I'm even more self-involved.

How much of your own solo success, though, was due to CSNY?
For sure CSNY put my name out there. They gave me a lot of publicity. But, in all modesty, After the Gold Rush, which was kind of the turning point, was a strong album. I really think it was. A lot of hard work went into it. Everything was there. The picture it painted was a strong one. After the Gold Rush was the spirit of Topanga Canyon. It seemed like I realized that I'd gotten somewhere. I joined CSNY and was still working a lot with Crazy Horse...I was playing all the time. And having a great time. Right after that album, I left the house. It was a good coda.

How did you cope with your first real blast of superstardom after that?
The first thing I did was a long tour of small halls. Just me and a guitar. I loved it. It was real personal. Very much a one-on-one thing with the crowd. It was later, after Harvest, that I hid myself away. I tried to stay away from it all. I thought the record [Harvest] was good, but I also knew that something else was dying. I became very reclusive. I didn't want to come out much.

Why? Were you depressed? Scared?
I think I was pretty happy. In spite of everything, I had my old lady and moved to the ranch. A lot of it was my back. I was in and out of hospitals for the two years between After the Gold Rush and Harvest. I have one weak side and all the muscles slipped on me. My discs slipped. I couldn't hold my guitar up. That's why I sat down on my whole solo tour. I couldn't move around too well, so I laid low for a long time on the ranch and just didn't have any contact, you know. I wore a brace. Crosby would come up to see how I was, we'd go for a walk and it took me 45 minutes to get to the studio, which is only 400 yards from the house. I could only stand up four hours a day. I recorded most of Harvest in the brace. That's a lot of the reason it's such a mellow album. I couldn't physically play an electric guitar. "Are You Ready for the Country," "Alabama" and "Words" were all done after I had the operation. The doctors were starting to talk about wheelchairs and shit, so I had some discs removed. But for the most part, I spent two years flat on my back. I had a lot of time to think about what had happened to me.

Have you ever been in analysis?
You mean have I ever been to a psychiatrist? No. [laughs] They're all real interested in me though. They always ask a lot of questions when I'm around them.

What do they ask?
Well, I had some seizures. They used to ask me a lot of questions about how I felt, stuff like that. I told them all the thoughts I have and the images I see if I, you know, faint or fall down or something. That's not real important though.

Do you still have seizures?
Yeah, I still do. I wish I didn't. I thought I had it licked.

Is it a physical or mental...
I don't know. Epilepsy is something nobody knows much about. It's just part of me. Part of my head, part of what's happening in there. Sometimes something in my brain triggers it off. Sometimes when I get really high it's a very psychedelic experience to have a seizure. You slip into some other world. Your body's flapping around and you're biting your tongue and batting your head on the ground but your mind is off somewhere else. The only scary thing about it is not going or being there, it's realizing you're totally comfortable in this...void. And that shocks you back into reality. It's a very disorienting experience. It's difficult to get a grip on yourself. The last time it happened, it took about an hour-and-a-half of just walking around the ranch with two of my friends to get it together.

Has it ever happened onstage?
No. Never has. I felt like it was a couple times and I've always left the stage. I get too high or something. It's just pressure from around, you know. That's why I don't like crowds too much.

What were the sessions like for Déjà Vu? Was it a band effort?
The band sessions on that record were "Helpless," "Woodstock" and "Almost Cut My Hair." That was Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. All the other ones were combinations, records that were more done by one person using the other people. "Woodstock" was a great record at first. It was a great live record, man. Everyone played and sang at once. Stephen sang the shit out of it. The track was magic. Then, later on, they were in the studio for a long time and started nitpicking. Sure enough, Stephen erased the vocal and put another one on that wasn't nearly as incredible. They did a lot of things over again that I thought were more raw and vital sounding. But that's all personal taste. I'm only saying that because it might be interesting to some people how we put that album together. I'm happy with every one of the things I've recorded with them. They turned out really fine. I certainly don't hold any grudges.

You seem a bit defensive.
Well, everybody always concentrates on this whole thing that we fight all the time among each other. That's a load of shit. They don't know what the fuck they're talking about. It's all rumors. When the four of us are together it's real intense. When you're dealing with any four totally different people who all have ideas on how to do one thing, it gets steamy. And we love it, man. We're having a great time. People make up so much shit, though. I've read so much gossip in Rolling Stone alone...Ann Landers would blanch. It would surprise you. Somehow we've gotten on this social-register level and it has nothing to do with what we're trying to put out. The music press writes the weirdest shit about us. They're just wasting their fucking time.

There was a recent item published that CSNY had tried to record a new album but couldn't because you 'felt someplace else.'
Total bullshit. That's just somebody trying to come up with a good line and stick it in my mouth. 'Yeah, that's kind of ethereal. Sounds like something Neil Young might say.' And bingo...it's like they were there. We had some recording sessions, you know, and we recorded a few things. That's what happened. We went down to the Record Plant in Sausalito, rented some studio time and left with two things in the can.

What was that?
A song of David's and a song of Graham's that were great. We were really into something nice. But a lot of things were happening at the same time. Crosby's baby was about to be born. Some of us wanted to rest for a while. We'd been working very hard. Everybody has a different viewpoint and it just takes us a while to get them all together. It's a great group for that, though. I'm sure there'll come a time when we'll do something again. We really did accomplish some things at those sessions. And just because the sessions only lasted three days, people started building up bullshit stories. We all love each other, but we're into another period where we're all hot on our own projects. Stephen's on tour with his new album, Graham and David are recording and I'm into my new album with Crazy Horse. Looking back, we might have been wiser to do the album before the tour. While we were still building the energy. But there's other times to record. Atlantic still has CSNY. Whenever we record together, we do it for Ahmet, which I think is right. Ahmet Ertegun kept the Buffalo Springfield afloat for as long as it was. He's always been great. I love him. There may be a live album to come from the tour last summer too. I know there's at least 25 minutes of my songs that are definitely releasable. We've got some really good stuff in the can for that tour. There was some good playing.

Why did you travel totally separate from everyone else on that tour?
I wanted to stay totally separate from everything, except the music. It worked well. I left right after every gig with my kid, my dog and two friends. I'd be refreshed and feeling great for every show.

Why did you make a movie?
It was something that I wanted to do. The music, which has been and always will be my primary thing, just seemed to point that way. I wanted to express a visual picture of what I was singing about.

One critic wrote that the movie's theme was 'life is pointless.'
Maybe that's what the guy got out of it. I just made a feeling. It's hard to say what the movie means. I think it's a good film for a first film. I think it's a really good film. I don't think I was trying to say that life is pointless. It does lay a lot of shit on people though. It wasn't made for entertainment. I'll admit, I made it for myself. Whatever it is, that's the way I felt. I made it for me. I never even had a script.

Did the bad reviews surprise you at all?
Of course not. The film community doesn't want to see me in there. What do they want with Journey Through the Past? [laughs] It's got no plot. No point. No stars. They don't want to see that. But the next time, man, we'll get them. The next time. I've got all the equipment, all the ideas and motivation to make another picture. I've even been keeping my chops up as a cameraman by being on hire under the name of Bernard Shakey. I filmed a Hyatt House commercial not too long ago. I'm set. [laughs] I'm just waiting for the right time.

What about a plot?
It's real simple. Maybe it's not a plot but it's a very strong feeling. It's built around three or four people living together. No music. I'll never make another movie that has anything to do with me. I'll tell you that. That was the only way I could get to do the first movie. I wanted to be in a movie, so I did it. I sacrificed myself as a musician to do it.

So you don't really consider the soundtrack album an official Neil Young release?
No. There was an unfortunate sequence of events surrounding Journey Through the Past. The record company told me that they'd finance me doing the movie only if I gave them the soundtrack album. They took the thing [the soundtrack] and put it right out. Then they told me that they didn't want to release the movie because it wasn't...well, they wanted to group it with a bunch of other films. I wanted to get it out there on its own. So they chickened out on the movie because they thought it was weird. But they took me for the album. That's always been a ticklish subject with me. That's the only instance of discooperation and confusion that I've ever had with Warners. Somebody really missed the boat on that one. They fucked me up for sure. It's all right though. We found another distributor. It paid for itself. Even though it got banned in England, you know. They thought it was immoral. There were swearing and references to Christ that didn't set well with them.

Why did you leave the ranch?
It just got to be too big of a trip. There was too much going on the last couple of years. None of it had anything to do with music. I just had too many fucking people hanging around who don't really know me. They were parasites whether they intended to be or not. They lived off me, used my money to buy things, used my telephone to make their calls. General leeching. It hurt my feelings a lot when I reached that realization. I didn't want to believe I was being taken advantage of. I didn't like having to be boss and I don't like having to say 'Get the fuck out.' That's why I have different houses now. When people gather around me, I just split now. I mean my ranch is more beautiful and lasting than ever. It's strong without me. I just don't feel like it's the only place I can be and be safe anymore. I feel much stronger now.

Have you got a name for the new album?
I think I'll call it My Old Neighborhood. Either that or Ride My Llama. It's weird, I've got all these songs about Peru, the Aztecs and the Incas. Time travel stuff. We've got one song called "Marlon Brando, John Ehrlichman, Pocahontas and Me," I'm playing a lot of electric guitar and that's what I like best. Two guitars, bass and drums. And it's realy flying off the ground too. Fucking unbelievable. I've got a bet with Elliot that it'll be out before the end of September. After that we'll probably go out on a fall tour of 3000 seaters. Me and Crazy Horse again. I couldn't be happier. That, combined with the bachelor life...I feel magnificent. Now is the first time I can remember coming out of a relationship, definitely not wanting to get into another one. I'm just not looking. I'm so happy with the space I'm in right now. It's like spring. [laughs] I'll sell you two bottles of it for $1.50.
"Looking back on it, this tour's been a flash. Really fast. Very poetic, too. Lots of battles and conquests, backdropped by the din of the hordes. Aside from the fact that it's been our most successful tour on every level, I just found myself having a great time all the way through."

Backstage at the last show on Led Zeppelin's North American itinerary, Robert Plant was ready to celebrate. In two-and-a-half months of sold-out concerts the band had barnstormed its way to a once elusive critical acceptance, a complete commercial resurgence of its six-album catalog and a concert gross of more than five million dollars.

"We had no trouble adjusting to the tour at all," Plant continued. "Normally, it takes awhile to get into the swing of things. Not this time. I've never been more into a tour before. The music's jelled amazingly well. Everyone loved Physical Graffiti. That meant a lot. It's like we're on an incredible winning streak."

The 33-date jaunt was not without turbulence, though. The first week and a half, based out of Chicago's Ambassador Hotel, was plagued by health problems. Jimmy Page's left ring finger — broken in a slamming train door — kept him in almost constant pain or depression. "This is so damn futile," he grumbled daily. "I can't fucking play the way I should."

Several days into the tour, Plant fell victim to the flu season; one concert, in St. Louis, was postponed. No sooner was Plant back in action than John "Bonzo" Bonham developed stomach problems that forced the highly combustible drummer to keep an uneasily low profile for the first leg of the tour. Only bassist/keyboard player John Paul Jones remained a fit specimen. "Nothing exciting ever happens to me," he said.

There were also some problems at halls along the way. A February 4th show at the Boston Garden was canceled by city officials after early arrivals caused $30,000 damage. At mid-March dates in Seattle, 500 or so concertgoers were refused admission to the Coliseum when their tickets turned out to be counterfeit; one alleged scalper was arrested with $1,475 in his pockets; and three people were busted for giving Jimmy Page a $2,100 Les Paul guitar that belonged to a local music teacher. And in Los Angeles, a wire service claimed that a massive bust had occurred at a concert by the group; the raid had actually happened at the Shrine Auditorium during a performance by Robin Trower.

"It's typical," said Swan Song Records veep Danny Goldberg. "What can I say? Sometimes it seems like Zeppelin are now where the Stones once were. The media automatically assumes us to be the bad boys. You know, blame it on Led Zeppelin . . ."

Jimmy Page, however, has no complaints. "The last thing I want to be," he said, "is respectable."

According to Page, the Texas/West Coast part of the tour was where the group "hit new peaks every night." After ten days of convalescing, Page's broken finger healed to the point where he spent afternoons furiously composing new material on an acoustic guitar. And Plant boasted that "my voice was getting so good by the end I felt like I could sing anything." One night at the Forum, he moved out of the spacey middle of "Dazed and Confused" and led the band into Joni Mitchell's "Woodstock" and, later, even a version of "Take It Easy."

The Los Angeles concerts (two nights in Long Beach, three at the Forum) played to audiences familiar with Physical Graffiti. "Trampled Underfoot" and "Kashmir," two numbers which had received a mild reception at the tour's outset, were now crowd favorites, overshadowing older standards like "The Song Remains the Same" and "Over the Hills and Far Away." It was the show-closing "Stairway to Heaven," however, that consistently drew the biggest response.

But not all the response was favorable. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, critic Robert Hilburn said: "Besides setting box-office records on this tour, the English group also may be setting some kind of record for the most clichés in a single concert: a mini-lightshow, steam from dry ice covering the stage [three different times], the band's name spelled out in lights . . . an explosion at the rear of the stage and, of course, the obligatory 20-minute solo."

He dismissed the show as "a numbing combination of intense, tenacious music and hopelessly limited imagination."

Page was quick to defend the act's length. "We need that amount of time to get everything across. You put on a support act and they're gonna want to do at least an hour — probably an hour and a half — so that makes the whole show about five hours long, including gear changeovers. Some halls have to get everybody out by 11:00, so where does that leave the headliner?

"We established a policy long ago that our concerts would feature only Zeppelin and the people would know exactly what they were coming to hear. Myself, I get fed up with hearing about groups who only do a 50-minute show. It's not right. It all depends on how much a performer has got to say, I suppose, and Zeppelin has got quite a bit to put across."

For the final ten dates, Zeppelin used an entire floor at Hollywood's Continental Hyatt House as its base. So many groupies waited hopefully in the lobby that an entirely different group appeared to pick them up. Locals took to calling the hotel the "Riot House."

As always, an armed guard sat outside each of the group member's rooms. Page, for one, disliked the menacing flavor of it all. "We had some vague death threats earlier in the tour," he explained. "I imagine that makes the armed guards a necessity, but . . . Christ." He let out an exasperated sigh. "This is one thing that really bothers me. I don't think we're a band that's hated by any means. I get good, warm feelings from our fans. We're not the sort of band people really want to be nasty to."

Flying back and forth to concerts in Seattle, Vancouver and San Diego, the band and their 18-person entourage made frequent pilgrimages to L.A. nightspots like the Troubadour (for Bobby "Blue" Bland and Kokomo), the Roxy (for Suzi Quatro) and the Greenhouse Restaurant, where Jimmy Page met longtime idol Joni Mitchell. Page had been bashful about an introduction, telling acquaintances that "if she's been hit on half as many times as I've been hit on tonight, she doesn't want to know," but eventually they enjoyed some small talk together.

Los Angeles also saw the increased activity of John Bonham. At a party hosted by Zeppelin in honor of the Pretty Things, Bonham threw several stomach punches at Sounds correspondent Andy McConnell. McConnell, who'd had an amicable meeting with the drummer earlier that afternoon, shined a flashlight, in Bonham's face and cracked, "You're an ugly fucker aren't you?" Bonzo responded by knocking McConnell across the room.

"You just don't do things like that to Bonzo," said one Zeppelin roadie, "especially when he's had a few drinks. After a certain point the Beast goes on the prowl and the only thing that amuses him is pillage."

Earlier on the tour, in Texas, Bonham took a fancy to a custom Corvette. The owner was tracked down and offered an irrefusable amount. Bonham then "paid a small fortune" to have the car towed to L.A., where he couldn't get it insured. Undaunted, he snapped up a $1,400 Ford hot rod for the sole purpose of dragging on Sunset Strip. In two weeks of racing anyone who dared accept his challenge, he was stopped only once.

"When the cop got to the window," said Bad Company guitarist Mick Ralphs, a passenger at the time, "Bonzo turned on the charm. He told him we were musicians, that we'd been rehearsing all day and we were blowing off a little steam. He didn't get a ticket."

On the afternoon of the tour's close, Plant emphasized that the group would always remain a road band. "We've played every single market that there is to play in the last few years . . . apart from Bangkok and India, which we'll get to in the next year. There's no reason why other than the fact that we just love to play. We love touring too much to give it up. We took a film crew on our last tour, you know. The movie'll be out soon and that one film will be the end-all story of why we have such a great time on the road." But when asked the movie's release date, Zeppelin manager Peter Grant only snickered. "You must be talking about the most expensive home movie ever made," he said with laughter in his voice. "Just say it's held up in production."

Outside of three sold-out English shows at Earl's Court in late May, Zeppelin has no firm plans. Plant, Bonham and Jones will return to their families in various parts of Britain, while Page, the group's only bachelor, will sojourn through Europe and the Far East. "I feel the need to aimlessly travel, to soak up some new experiences," the guitarist explained. "This is something I've looked forward to doing for years."

As the group left for home, Swan Song exec Goldberg discouraged rumors of another U.S. tour as early as this summer. "They could come back in June or they could come back in '77. Once they get working on something, you never know when they'll come up for air."
Led Zeppelin's bassist and keyboard player, was quietly playing backgammon and half listening to a phone-in radio talk show on New York FM. 

"I was in a club last night when someone asked me if I wanted to meet Jimmy Page," the show's host suddenly offered between calls. "You know, when I think about it, there's no one I'd rather meet less than someone as disgusting as Jimmy Page." Jones bolted up from his game. "Let me just say that Led Slime can't play their way out of a paper bag and if you plan on seeing them tomorrow night at the Garden, those goons are ripping you off. Now don't start wasting my time defending Led Slime. If you're thinking about calling up to do that, stick your head in the toilet and flush."

Jones, normally a man of quiet reserve, strode furiously across the room. He snapped up a phone and dialed the station. After a short wait, the talk show host picked up the phone.

"What would you like to talk about?"

"Led Zeppelin," Jones answered cooly in his clipped British accent. The line went dead. Victim of an eight-second delay button, the exchange was never given air time.

It was a familiar battle, as Jones saw it. Although Led Zeppelin has managed to sell more than a million units apiece on all five of its albums and is currently working a U.S. tour that is expected to be the largest grossing undertaking in rock history, the band has been continually kicked, shoved, pummeled and kneed in the groin by critics of all stripes. "I know it's unnecessary to fight back," Jones said. True enough: The Zep's overwhelming popularity speaks for itself. "I just thought I'd defend myself one last time."

The night after that aborted defense, in the.first of three concerts at Madison Square Garden, Led Zeppelin brought a standing-room-only audience to its feet with one of the finest shows of its six-year career. On Page's unexpected midset impulse, the band launched unrehearsed into a stunning 20-minute version of his tour de force, "Dazed and Confused." The tension of uncertain success was an evident and electric element in Zeppelin's performance that evening. "No question about it," lead singer Robert Plant enthused before returning to the stage for a second encore of "Communication Breakdown," "the tour has begun."

It has been a long time since Zeppelin last rock & rolled. After 18 months spent laboring over their new double album, Physical Graffiti, the band has some warming up to do. "It's unfortunate there's got to be anybody there," Plant said. "But we've got to feel our way. There's a lot of energy here this tour. Much more than the last one." The tour's official opening night, January 18th at the Minneapolis Sports Center, went surprisingly well considering the circumstances. Only a week before, Jimmy Page broke the tip of his left ring finger when it was caught in a slamming train door. With only one rehearsal to perfect what Page calls his "three-and-a-half-finger technique," the classic Zeppelin live pieces, "Dazed and Confused" and "Since I've Been Loving You," were indefinitely retired. Codeine tablets and Jack Daniel's deadened the pain enough for Page to struggle through the band's demanding three-hour set.

Peter Grant, Led Zeppelin's manager and president of Swan Song, the group's record company, found those first few dates strange: "A Led Zeppelin concert without 'Dazed and Confused' is something I'll have to get used to. In a lot of ways that number is the band at its very best. There's one point in the song where Pagey can take off and do whatever he wants to. There is always the uncertainty of whether it will be five or 35 minutes long."

Page reacted to his injury with quiet desperation. "I have no doubt the tour is going to be good, it's just, dammit, I'm disappointed that I can't do all I can do." He began beating a fist quietly into the palm of his crippled hand. "I always want to do my very best and it's frustrating to have something hold me back. You can bet that 'Dazed and Confused' will be back in the set the very second I'm able to play it. We may not be brilliant for a few nights but we'll always be good."

The tour progressed satisfactorily through three nights at the Chicago Stadium and visits to Cleveland and Indianapolis until Plant came down with the flu. A show in St. Louis was postponed until mid-February and while Plant stayed behind to convalesce, the band flew to Los Angeles for a day off.

The rest sparked a shift into second gear and subsequent concerts in Greensboro, Detroit and Pittsburgh progressively improved, leading up to Led Zeppelin's tumultuous New York victory and the first version of "Dazed and Confused" on the tour. In the meantime, there was little of the savage hotel-room-splintering road fever Zeppelin is known for. "There hasn't been much room," said drummer John (Bonzo) Bonham a little sadly. "The music has taken up most of our concerns."

IT WAS IN late 1968 that Jimmy Page first put together the band that was to become Led Zeppelin. The name was suggested by Who drummer Keith Moon, and embodies an irony that hardly needs to be commented upon. Page first approached Robert Plant, then the lead singer for a raucous Birmingham group called the Band of Joy. "His voice," said Page, "was too great to be undiscovered. All I had to do from there was find a bassist and a drummer."

The latter came easily. Plant suggested Bonham, the drummer from the Band of Joy. Bassist John Paul Jones was the last to join. "I answered a classified ad in Melody Maker," he said. "My wife made me." Jones had a sessionman's background. He had arranged some of the Stones' Their Satanic Majesties Request album. He also arranged albums for producer Mickey Most's stable. "I arranged albums by Jeff Beck, Lulu, Donovan and Herman's Hermits."


All four members used the word "magic" when recalling Zeppelin's first rehearsal. "I've never been so turned on in my life," says Plant. "Although we were all steeped in blues and R&B, we found out in the first hour and a half that we had our own identity."

Robert Plant, now 26, grew up in the Black Country, where the English industrial revolution began. He says he lived "a sheltered childhood" and that he began picking up on Buddy Guy, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Woody Guthrie almost as soon as he entered school. Drifting in and out of groups like the Delta Blues Band, the Crawling King Snakes and the Band of Joy, Plant became known locally as "the wild man of blues from the Black Country." He met Page in 1968, just before the formation of Led Zeppelin.

"Pagey and I are closer than ever on this tour." Plant said after the New York concert. "We've almost jelled into one person in a lot of ways."

Jimmy Page, now 31, grew up in Felton, a dreary community near London's Heathrow Airport. An only child, he had no playmates until he began school at the age of five. "That early isolation," says Page, "it probably had a lot to do with the way I turned out. A loner. A lot of people can't be on their own. They get frightened. Isolation doesn't bother me at all. It gives me a sense of security."

Page started playing guitar when he was 12. "Somebody had laid a Spanish guitar on us ... a very old one. I probably couldn't play it now if I tried. It was sitting around our living room for weeks and weeks. I wasn't interested. Then I heard a couple of records that really turned me on, the main one being Elvis's 'Baby, Let's Play House,' and I wanted to play it. I wanted to know what it was all about. This other guy at school showed me a few chords and I just went on from there."

After a stint of several years as one of England's leading session guitarists (he played on the Kinks' "You Really Got Me," Van Morrison and Them's "Here Comes the Night" and "Gloria," the Who's "I Can't Explain" and several Burt Bacharach hits, among others), Page joined the Yardbirds as a second lead guitarist to Jeff Beck. Beck was soon to leave the band and Page was left alone in the spotlight for a time. When the Yardbirds finally crumbled, Page was free to form Led Zeppelin.

The following conversations with Page and Plant took place over a period of two weeks. We began over tea in Plant's suite at Chicago's Ambassador Hotel. The talk continued three days later in Page's darkened room. "It's still morning," he shivered, sitting underneath a blanket on his sofa. "We may have to talk for three hours before I make any sense." The resulting interview, from which most of this material is taken, stretched into late afternoon. Page, a soft-spoken man. apparently preferred candles to electric light.

A visit to Plant several days later provided more material and one final visit with Page on the plane flight to New York supplied the remaining details.

It wasn't until Led Zeppelin's last American tour in '73 that the media fully acknowledged the band's popularity.
PLANT: We decided to hire our first publicity firm after we toured here in the summer of '72. That was the same summer that the Stones toured and we knew full well that we were doing more business than them. We were getting better gates in comparison to a lot of people who were constantly glorified in the press. So without getting too egocentric, we thought it was time that people heard something about us other than that we were eating women and throwing the bones out the window. That whole lunacy thing was all people knew about us and it was all word-of-mouth. All those times of lunacy were okay, but we aren't and never were monsters. Just good-time boys, loved by their fans and hated by their critics.

Do you feel any competition with the Stones?
PAGE: Naw. I don't think of it that way. I don't feel any competition at all. The Stones are great and always have been. Jagger's lyrics are just amazing. Right on the ball every time. I mean, I know all about how we're supposed to be the biggest group in the world and all, but I don't ever think about it. I don't feel that competition enters into it. It's who makes good music and who doesn't ... and who's managed to sustain themselves.

What motivates you at this point? 
PAGE: I love playing. If it was down to just that, it would be utopia. But it's not. It's airplanes, hotel rooms, limousines and armed guards standing outside rooms. I don't get off on that part of it at all. But it's the price I'm willing to pay to get out and play. I was very restless over the last 18 months where we laid off and worked on the album.

PLANT: There's a constant conflict, really, within me. As much as I really enjoy what I do at home ... I play on my own little soccer team and I've been taking part in the community and living the life of any ordinary guy, I always find myself wistful and enveloped in a feeling I can't really get out of my system. I miss this band when we aren't playing. I have to call Jimmy up or something to appease that restlessness. The other night when we played for the first time again I found the biggest smile on my mouth.


What's this rumor, Jimmy, about a solo album? 
PAGE: Chalk that off to Keith Richard's sense of humor. I did what could possibly be the next Stones B side. It was Rick Grech, Keith and me doing a number called "Scarlet." I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album.

I don't need to do a solo album and neither does anybody else in the band. The chemistry is such that there's nobody in the background who's so frustrated that he has to bring out his own LPs. I don't really like doing that Townshend number of telling everybody exactly what to play. I don't like that too much. A group's a group after all, isn't it?

You've managed to continue undaunted in the midst of such criticism—especially in the early days of Zeppelin. How much do you believe in yourself? 
PAGE: I may not believe in myself, but I believe in what I'm doing. I know where I'm going musically. I can see my pattern and I'm going much slower than I thought I'd be going. I can tell how far I ought to be going, I know how to get there, all I've got to do is keep playing. That might sound a bit weird because of all the John McLaughlins who sound like they're in outer space or something. Maybe it's the tortoise and the hare.

I'm not a guitarist as far as a technician goes, I just pick it up and play it. Technique doesn't come into it. I deal in emotions. It's the harmonic side that's important. That's the side I expected to be much further along on than I am now. That just means to say that I've got to keep at it.

There's such a wealth of arts and styles within the instrument ... flamenco, jazz, rock, blues ... you name it, it's there. In the early days my dream was to fuse all those styles. Now composing has become just as important. Hand-in-hand with that, I think it's time to travel, start gathering some real right-in-there experiences with street musicians around the world. Moroccan musicians, Indian musicians ... it could be a good time to travel around now. This year. I don't know how everyone else is gonna take that, but that's the direction I'm heading in right now. This week, I'm a gypsy. Maybe next week it'll be glitter rock.

What would you again from your travels?
PAGE: Are you kidding? God, you know what you can gain when you sit down with the Moroccans. As a person and as a musician. That's how you grow. Not by living like this. Ordering up room service in hotels. It's got to be the opposite end of the scale. The balance has got to swing exactly the opposite. To the point where maybe I'll have an instrument and nothing else. I used to travel like that a long while ago. There's no reason I can't do it again. There's always this time thing. You can't buy time. Everything, for me, seems to be a race against time. Especially musically. I know what I want to get down and I haven't got much time to do it in. I had another idea of getting a traveling medicine wagon with a dropdown side and traveling around England. That might sound crazy to you, but over there it's so rural you can do it. Just drop down the side and play through big battery amps and mixers and it can all be as temporary or as permanent as I want it to be. I like change and I like contrast. I don't like being stuck in one situation, day to day. Domesticity and all that isn't really for me. Sitting in this hotel for a week is no picnic. That's when the road fever starts and that's when the breakages start, but I haven't gotten to that stage yet. I've been pretty mellow so far. Mind you, we're only into the tour a week.

How well do you remember your first American tour? 
PLANT: Nineteen years old and never been kissed, I remember it well. It's been a long time. Nowadays we're more into staying in our rooms and reading Nietzsche. There was good fun to be had, you know, it's just that in those days there were more people to have good fun with than there are now. The States were much more fun. L.A. was L.A. It's not L.A. now. L.A. infested with jaded 12-year-olds is not the L.A. that I really dug. It was the first place I ever landed in America: the first time I ever saw a cop with a gun, the first time I ever saw a 20-foot-long car. There were a lot of fun-loving people to crash into. People were genuinely welcoming us to the country and we started out on a path of positive enjoyment. Throwing eggs from floor to floor and really silly water battles and all the good fun that a 19-year-old boy should have. It was just the first steps of learning how to be crazy. We met a lot of people who we still know and a lot of people who have faded away. Some ODed. Some of them just grew up. I don't see the point in growing up.


You seem sincerely depressed over the matter. 
PLANT: Well, I am. I haven't lost my innocence particularly. I'm always ready to pretend I haven't. Yeah, it is a shame in a way. And it's a shame to see these young chicks bungle their lives away in a flurry and rush to compete with what was in the old days the goodtime relationships we had with the GTOs and people like that. When it came to looning, they could give us as much of a looning as we could give them. It's a shame, really. If you listen to "Sick Again," a track from Physical Graffiti, the words show I feel a bit sorry for them. "Clutching pages from your teenage dream in the lobby of the Hotel Paradise/Through the circus of the L.A. queen how fast you learn the downhill slide."* One minute she's 12 and the next minute she's 13 and over the top. Such a shame. They haven't got the style that they had in the old days ... way back in '68.

The last time I was in L.A. I got very bored. Boredom is a horrible thing. Boredom is the beginning of all destruction and everything that is negative. Every place is determined by the characters who are there. It's just that the character who are there. It's just that the chreacter rating at the moment has zeroed right out.

Of course, I enjoy it all, but as a total giggle. It's funny. I miss it. All the clamor. The whole lot. It's all a big rush. From the shit holes to the classiest hotels, it's all been fun. From the Shadow-box Motel where the walls crumbled during the night seven years ago to the Plaza, where the attorney general staying one floor above complained about me playing Little Feat records too loud last night.

Do you feel you have to top yourselves with each album? 
PAGE: No. Otherwise I would have been totally destroyed by the reviews of our last album, wouldn't I? You see, this is the point. I just don't care. I don't care what critics and other people think. So far I've been very, very fortunate because it appears that people like to hear the music I like to play. What more fortunate position can a musician be in? But I will still carry on changing all the time. You can't expect to be the same person you were three years ago. Some people expect you to be and can't come to terms with the fact that if a year has elapsed between LPs, that means one year's worth of changes. The material consequently is affected by that, the lyrics are affected by that ... the music too. I don't feel I have to top myself at all. It took a long time for this album mainly because when we originally went in to record it, John Paul Jones wasn't well and we had to cancel the time ... everything got messed up. It took three months to sort the situation out.

How does it feel to be your own record company executives? 
PAGE: I guess we are our own executives now, aren't we? Listen, give us time with Swan Song. You'll be surprised. We've got some good things lined up. I think the Pretty Things LP is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. We're executives and all that crap, but I'll tell you one thing, the label was never—right from the top—Led Zeppelin records. It's designed to bring in other groups and promote acts that have had raw deals in the past. It's a vehicle for them and not for us to just make a few extra pennies over the top. That's the cynical way of looking at a record company.

People have been asking me whether I'll be doing any producing for the label. I don't know. I'm just too involved with Zeppelin. I was offered a chance—a longstanding one too—to produce Freddie King, which I'd love to do. But I'd need time to work on it.

Do you feel that the music business is sagging in any way? 
PAGE: People always say that amidst their search for The Next Big Thing. The only real woomph was when the Stones and Beatles came over. But it's always said, "The business is dying! The business is dying!" I don't think so. There's too many good musicians around for the music around for the business to be sagging. There's so many different styles and facets of the 360-degree musical sphere to listen to. From tribal to classical music, it's all there. If the bottom was to sag out of that, for God's sake, help us all.

If there was never another record made, there's enough music recorded and in the vaults everywhere for me to be happy forever. Then again, I can listen to all different sorts of music. I don't really care about The Next Big Thing. It's interesting when something new comes along, a band of dwarfs playing electronic harps or something, but I'm not searching. Look at Bad Company and the Average White Band. Those guys have all been around in one form or another for a very long time. How many of the new ones coming through have really got a lot of substance? In Britain, I'm afraid there's not much at all. We've got to deal with Suzi Quatro and Mud. It's absurd. Top Ten shouldn't be crap, but it is.

How difficult was the first Led Zeppelin album to put together?
PAGE: It came together really quick. It was cut very shortly after the band was formed. Our only rehearsal was a two-week tour of Scandinavia that we did as the New Yardbirds. For material, we obviously went right down to our blues roots. I still had plenty of Yardbirds riffs left over. By the time Jeff [Beck] did go, it was up to me to come up with a lot of new stuff. It was this thing where Clapton set a heavy precedent in the Yardbirds which Beck had to follow and then it was even harder for me, in a way, because the second lead guitarist had suddenly become the first. And I was under pressure to come up with my own riffs. On the first LP I was still heavily influenced by the earlier days. I think it tells a bit, too. The album was made in three weeks. It was obvious that somebody had to take the lead, otherwise we'd have all sat around jamming and doing nothing for six months. But after that, on the second LP, you can hear the real group identity coming together.


Plant: That first album was the first time that headphones meant anything to me. What I heard coming back to me over the cans while I was singing was better than the finest chick in all the land. It had so much weight, so much power, it was devastating. I had a long ways to go with my voice then, but at the same time the enthusiasm and spark of working with Jimmy's guitar shows through quite well. It was all very raunchy then. Everything was fitting together into a trademark for us. We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most, and what we knew got more people back to the hotel after the gig.

We made no money on the first tour. Nothing at all. Jimmy put in every penny that he'd gotten from the Yard-birds and that wasn't much. Until Peter Grant took them over, they didn't make the money they should have made. So we made the album and took off on a tour with a road crew of one.

Jimmy, you once told me that you thought life was a gamble. What did you mean?
PAGE: So many people are frightened to take a chance in life and there's so many chances you have to take. You can't just find yourself doing something and not happy doing it. If you're working at the factory and you're cursing every day that you get up, at all costs get out of it. You'll just make yourself ill. That's why I say I'm very fortunate because I love what I'm doing. Seeing people's faces, really getting off on them, makes me incredibly happy. Genuinely.

What gambles have you taken?
PAGE: I'll give you a gamble. I was in a band, I won't give the name because it's not worth knowing about, but it was the sort of band where we were traveling around all the time in a bus. I did that for two years after I left school, to the point where I was starting to get really good bread. But I was getting ill. So I went back to art college. And that was a total change in direction. That's why I say it's possible to do. As dedicated as I was to playing the guitar, I knew doing it that way was doing me in forever. Every two months I had glandular fever. So for the next 18 months I was living on ten dollars a week and getting my strength up. But I was still playing.

PLANT: Let me tell you a little story behind the song "Ten Years Gone" on our new album. I was working my ass off before joining Zeppelin. A lady I really dearly loved said, "Right. It's me or your fans." Not that I had fans, but I said, "I can't stop, I've got to keep going." She's quite content these days, I imagine. She's got a washing machine that works by itself and a little sports car. We wouldn't have anything to say anymore. I could probably relate to her, but she couldn't relate to me. I'd be smiling too much. Ten years gone, I'm afraid. Anyway, there's a gamble for you.

PAGE: I'll give you another one. I was at art college and started to do sessionwork. Believe me, a lot of guys would consider that to be the apex—studio work. I left that to join the Yardbirds at a third of the bread because I wanted to play again. I didn't feel I was playing enough in the studio. I was doing three studio dates a day and I was becoming one of those sort of people that I hated.

What was the problem with session work? 
PAGE: Certain sessions were really a pleasure to do, but the problem was that you never knew what you were gonna do. You might have heard that I played on a Burt Bacharach record. It's true. I never knew what I was doing. You just got booked into a particular studio at the hours of two and five-thirty. Sometimes it would be somebody you were happy to see, other times it was, "What am I doing here?"

When I started doing sessions, the guitar was in vogue. I was playing solos every day. Then afterwards, when the Stax thing was going on and you got whole brass sections coming in, I ended up hardly playing anything, just a little riff here and there ... no solos. And I remember one particular occasion when I hadn't played a solo for, quite literally, a couple of months. And I was asked to play a solo on a rock & roll thing. I played it and felt that what I'd done was absolute crap. I was so disgusted with myself that I made my mind up that I had to get out of it. It was messing me right up.

And how do you look back on your days with the Yardbirds?
PAGE: I have really good memories. Apart from one tour which nearly killed all of us, it was so intense—apart from that, musically it was a great group to play in. I've never regretted anything I've ever done. Any musician would have jumped at the chance to play in that band. It was particularly good when Jeff and I were both doing lead guitar. It really could have been built into something exceptional at that point, but unfortunately there's precious little on wax of that particular point. There's only "Stroll On" from the Blow-Up film—that was quite funny—and "Happenings Ten Years Time Ago" and "Daisy." We just didn't get into the studio too much at that time.


Obviously, there were ups and downs. Everybody wants to know about the feuds and personality conflicts ... I don't think that it ever got really evil. It never got that bad. If it was presented in the right way, maybe a Yardbirds reunion album would be a good thing to do someday. Somehow I can't see Jeff doing it, though. He's a funny bloke.

You live in Aleister Crowley's home. [Crowley was a poet and magician at the turn of the century and was notorious for his Black Magic rites—Ed.]
PAGE: Yes, it was owned by Aleister Crowley. But there were two or three owners before Crowley moved into it. It was also a church that was burned to the ground with the congregation in it. And that's the site of the house. Strange things have happened in that house that had nothing to do with Crowley. The bad vibes were already there. A man was beheaded there and sometimes you can hear his head rolling down. I haven't actually heard it, but a friend of mine, who is extremely straight and doesn't know anything about anything like that at all, heard it. He thought it was the cats bungling about. I wasn't there at the time, but he told the help, "Why don't you let the cats out at night? They make a terrible racket, rolling about in the halls." And they said, "The cats are locked in a room every night." Then they told him the story of the house. So that sort of thing was there before Crowley got there. Of course, after Crowley there have been suicides, people carted off to mental hospitals. ...

And you have no contact with any of the spirits?
PAGE: I didn't say that. I just said I didn't hear the head roll.

What's your attraction to the place?
PAGE: The unknown. I'm attracted by the unknown, but I take precautions. I don't go walking into things blind.

Do you feel safe in the house?
PAGE: Yeah. Well, all my houses are isolated. Many is the time I just stay home alone. I spend a lot of time near water. Crowley's house is in Loch Ness, Scotland. I have another house in Sussex, where I spend most of my time. It's quite near London. It's moated and terraces off into lakes. I mean, I could tell you things, but it might give people ideas. A few things have happened that would freak some people out, but I was surprised actually at how composed I was. I don't really want to go on about my personal beliefs or my involvement in magic. I'm not trying to do a Harrison or a Townshend. I'm not interested in turning anybody on to anybody that I'm turned on to ... if people want to find things, they find them themselves. I'm a firm believer in that.

What did you think about your portrayal in Rock Dreams? As a guitar Mafioso along with Alvin Lee, Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend and Eric Clapton? 
PAGE: There's nothing about Zeppelin in there at all. The artist spends his whole time masturbating over the Stones in that book, doesn't he? The Stones in drag and things like that. When I first saw that book, I thought, aw, this is really great. But when I really started to look at it, there were things that I just didn't like. People can laugh at this, but I didn't like to see a picture of Ray Charles driving around in the car with his arm around a chick. It's tasteless. But the guy's French, so what can we say? Ray Charles is blind. What kind of humor is that? They may be his rock dreams, but they sure aren't mine.

Out of all the guitarists to come out of the Sixties, though, Beck, Clapton, Lee, Townshend and I are still having a go. That says something. Beck, Clapton and me were sort of the Richmond/Croydon type clan, and Alvin Lee, I don't know where he came from. Lester or something like that. So he was never in with it a lot. And Townshend, Townshend was from Middlesex and he used to go down to the clubs and watch the other guitarists. I didn't meet him, though, until "I Can't Explain." I was doing the session guitar work on that. I haven't seen Townshend in years. But I suppose we've all kept going and tried to do better and better and better. I heard some stuff from Beck's solo LP recently that was fucking brilliant. Really good. But I don't know, it's all instrumental and it's a guitarist's guitar LP, I think. He's very mellow and Beck at his best can be very tasty.

Have you seen Eric Clapton with his new band? 
PAGE: Oh, Eric. Fucking hell, Eric. Yes, I saw him with his new band and also at his Rainbow concert. At least at the Rainbow he had some people with some balls with him. He had Townshend and Ronnie Wood and Jimmy Karstein and [Jim] Capaldi. "Pearly Queen" was incredible. And I would have thought that after that, he would have said, "Right, I'm gonna get English musicians." Ever since he's been with American musicians, he's laid back further and further.

I went over to see him after he'd done his Rainbow concert and it wasn't hard to sense his total disappointment that Derek and the Dominoes were never really accepted. It must have been a big thing for him that they didn't get all the acclaim that the Cream did. But the thing is, when a band has a certain chemistry, like the Cream had ... wow, the chances of re-creating that again are how many billion to one. It's very, very difficult.


The key to Zeppelin's longevity has been change. We put out our first LP; then a second one that was nothing like the first, then a third LP totally different from them, and on it went. I know why we got a lot of bad press on our albums. People couldn't understand, a lot of reviewers couldn't understand why we put out an LP like Zeppelin II, then followed it up with III with "That's the Way" and acoustic numbers like that on it. They just couldn't understand it. The fact was that Robert and I had gone away to Bron-Y-Aur cottage in Wales and started writing songs. Christ, that was the material we had, so we used it. It was nothing like, "We got to do some heavy rock & roll because that's what our image demands ..." Album-wise, it usually takes a year for people to catch up with what we're doing.

Why did you go to Bron-Y-Aur cottage for the third album?
PLANT: It was time to step back, take stock and not get lost in it all. Zeppelin was starting to get very big and we wanted the rest of our journey to take a pretty level course. Hence, the trip into the mountains and the beginning of the ethereal Page and Plant. I thought we'd be able to get a little peace and quiet and get your actual Californian, Marin County blues, which we managed to do in Wales rather than San Francisco. It was a great place. "The Golden Breast" is what the name means. The place is in a little valley and the sun always moves across it. There's even a track on the new album, a little acoustic thing, that Jimmy got together up there. It typifies the days when we used to chug around the countryside in jeeps. It was a good idea to go there.

We had written quite a bit of the second album on the road. It was a real road album, too. No matter what the critics said, the proof in the pudding was that it got a lot of people off. The reviewer for Rolling Stone, for instance, was just a frustrated musician. Maybe I'm just flying my own little ego ship, but sometimes people resent talent. I don't even remember what the criticism was, but as far as I'm concerned, it was a good, maybe even great, road album. The third album was the album of albums. If anybody had us labeled as a heavy metal group, that destroyed them.

But there were acoustic numbers on the very first album.
PAGE: That's it! There you go. When the third LP came out and got its reviews, Crosby, Stills and Nash had just formed. That LP had just come out and because acoustic guitars had come to the forefront, all of a sudden: Led Zeppelin Go Acoustic! I thought, Christ, where are their heads and ears? There were three acoustic songs on the first album and two on the second.

Y ou talk of this "race against time," Jimmy. Where do you think you'll be at 40?
PAGE: I don't know whether I'll reach 40. I don't know whether I'll reach 35. I can't be sure about that. I am bloody serious. I am very, very serious. I didn't think I'd make 30.

Why not?
PAGE: I just had this fear. Not fear of dying, but just ... wait a minute, let's get this right. I just felt that ... I wouldn't reach 30. That's all there was to it. It was something in me, something inbred. I'm over 30 now, but I didn't expect to be here. I wasn't having nightmares about it, but ... I'm not afraid of death. That is the greatest mystery of all. That'll be it, that one. But it is all a race against time. You never know what can happen. Like breaking my finger. I could have broken my whole hand and been out of action for two years.

You've been criticized for writing "dated flower-child gibberish" lyrics ... 
PLANT: How can anybody be a "dated flower child"? The essence of the whole trip was the desire for peace and tranquillity and an idyllic situation. That's all anybody could ever want so how could it be "dated flower-child gibberish"? If it is, then I'll just carry on being a dated flower child. I put a lot of work into my lyrics. Not all my stuff is meant to be scrutinized, though. Things like "Black Dog" are blatant let's-do-it-in-the-bath-type things, but they make their point just the same. People listen. Otherwise, you might as well sing the menu from the Continental Hyatt House.

How important was "Stairway to Heaven" to you? 
PAGE: To me, I thought "Stairway" crystallized the essence of the band. It had everything there and showed the band at its best ... as a band, as a unit. Not talking about solos or anything, it had everything there. We were careful never to release it as a single. It was a milestone for us. Every musician wants to do something of lasting quality, something which will hold up for a long time and I guess we did it with "Stairway." Townshend probably thought that he got it with Tommy. I don't know whether I have the ability to come up with more. I have to do a lot of hard work before I can get anywhere near those stages of consistent, total brilliance.

I don't think there are too many people who are capable of it. Maybe one. Joni Mitchell. That's the music that I play at home all the time, Joni Mitchell. Court and Spark I love because I'd always hoped that she'd work with a band. But the main thing with Joni is that she's able to look at something that's happened to her, draw back and crystallize the whole situation, then write about it. She brings tears to my eyes, what more can I say? It's bloody eerie. I can relate so much to what she says. "Now old friends are acting strange/They shake their heads/They say I've changed."* I'd like to know how many of her original friends she's got. I'd like to know how many of the original friends any well-known musician has got. You'd be surprised. They think—particularly that thing of change—they all assume that you've changed. For the worse. There are very few people I can call real, close friends. They're very, very precious to me.


How about you? 
PLANT: I live with the people I've always lived with. I'm quite content. It's like the remnants of my old Beatnik days. All my old mates, it lends to a lot of good company. There's no unusual reaction to my trip at all because I've known them so long. Now and again there will be the occasional joke about owing someone two dollars from the days in '63 when I was a broke blues singer with a washboard, but it's good. I'm happy.

Do you have any favorite American guitarists?
PAGE: Well, let's see, we've lost the best guitarist any of us ever had and that was Hendrix. The other guitarist I started to get into died also, Clarence White. He was absolutely brilliant. Gosh. On a totally different style—the control, the guy who played on the Maria Muldaur single, "Midnight at the Oasis." Amos Garrett. He's Les Paul oriented and Les Paul is the one, really. We wouldn't be anywhere if he hadn't invented the electric guitar. Another one is Elliot Randall, the guy who guested on the first Steely Dan album. He's great. Band-wise, Little Feat is my favorite American group.

The only term I won't accept is "genius." The term "genius" gets used far too loosely in rock & roll. When you hear the melodic structures of what classical musicians put together and you compare it to that of a rock & roll record, there's a hell of a long way rock & roll has to go. There's a certain standard in classical music that allows the application of the term "genius," but you're treading on thin ice if you start applying it to rock & rollers. The way I see it, rock & roll is folk music. Street music. It isn't taught in school. It has to be picked up. You don't find geniuses in street musicians, but that doesn't mean to say you can't be really good. You get as much out of rock & roll artistically as you put into it. There's nobody who can teach you. You're on your own and that's what I find so fascinating about it.

Last question. What did you think about President Ford's children naming Led Zeppelin as their favorite group on national television? 
PLANT: I think it's really a mean deal that we haven't been invited around there for tea. Perhaps Jerry thought we'd wreck the joint. Now if we'd had a publicist three tours back, he might be on the road with us now. I was pleased to hear that they like our music around the White House. It's good to know they've got taste.

Final comments? 
PAGE: Just say that I'm still searching for an angel with a broken wing. It's not very easy to find them these days. Especially when you're staying at the Plaza Hotel.
LOS ANGELES — Even amid their legal action against former manager Clifford Davis, Fleetwood Mac maintains a low profile. The group has had few hit singles or magazine cover stories in a quiet, seven-year career, yet their concert appearances draw a steady stream of loyal followers and at least seven albums have sold in excess of 200,000 copies.

Sitting in the living room of John and Christine McVie's modest Laurel Canyon home, Fleetwood Mac (current lineup: Bob Welch, guitar and vocals; John McVie, bass; Christine McVie, keyboards and vocals; Mick Fleetwood, drums) is about as visually mild offstage as they are on. There is little about their faded Levi's and J.C. Penney shirts that even hints at rock & roll.

Mick Fleetwood: "He Thought We Wouldn't Fight Back"

"I guess it's just not our nature to have an image," Welch, the band's only non-Englishman, concedes. "At some point you just have to realize that you may never be Elton John. But then again, the point isn't to sell a record to every man, woman and child on earth. Point is to have a career, do what you're doing and do it well. Fleetwood Mac has done just that."

For the past year, though, much of the band's time has been spent in law offices, locking horns with ex-manager Davis. According to Fleetwood, Davis approached the road-weary musicians last year about yet another nationwide tour. Met with rejection, he assembled a new Fleetwood Mac and – claiming full rights to the name – booked a tour.

"We were all on holiday when we found out what had happened," Fleetwood says. "Before the bogus band played too many dates, we had to physically get together and take legal advice. The impression Clifford had given was that he had every legal right to do what he did. We very soon found out apart from morally having no excuse, there was no legal right."

The band went to court and also to the studio. They emerged from the former with a restraining order that put a halt to the pseudo-Mac, and from the latter with their 12th album. Heroes Are Hard To Find. Still outstanding, though, is a final legal determination on ownership of the name.

The band agrees they have already won an important victory. "When things like this have happened," Fleetwood says, "many bands haven't had the stamina to see it through. It's very easy to say, 'God, it's just not worth it.' I'm sure Clifford never felt for one moment that we would stick this out. We manage ourselves now."

So Fleetwood Mac is on the road again, for the first time in a year. "Ironically, this is gonna be our vacation," Fleetwood says, grinning. "It's like we've forgotten what all the hassles were about. . . . We should have a lot of fun."

Mick Fleetwood. along with John McVie, an original member, remembers the early club days when if was Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac and the quartet also included double lead guitarists Green and Jeremy Spencer.

Their first album, Fleetwood Mac, topped the English LP charts, and a string of medium-sized British hit singles followed, including the original "Black Magic Woman." Soon after, guitarist Danny Kirwan joined the group as a third lead, and a month later they cut their only million-selling 45, an instrumental called "Albatross."

The band produced four more albums – English Rose, Mr. Wonderful, Fleetwood Mac in Chicago and Then Play On, their debut LP for Warner Bros. – before getting a taste of musical chairs in May 1970. Peter Green quit the band and began work on an instrumental solo album. It was titled, prophetically, The End of the Game; Green subsequently disappeared from the music business. For a replacement, the band added John McVie's wife, the former Christine Perfect of Chicken Shack. Leaderless, they recorded the much acclaimed Kiln House. From there, it was off to America.

Spencer departed in 1971 – simply disappeared from his Los Angeles hotel room, later turning up in the ranks of the Children of God, a religious cult. Welch, a Californian who came from a background of Las Vegas showbands, filled the slot.

Fleetwood Mac's next albums, Future Games and Bare Trees, displayed a brighter style of rock, laced with cooing harmonies and pretty melodies. Not long after Bare Trees, however, Danny Kirwan amicably left to pursue a solo career and was replaced by former John Baldry guitarist Bob Weston. The five-piece band lasted for two albums, Mystery To Me and Penguin (with the brief inclusion of ex-Savoy Brown singer Dave "Tell Mama" Walker on the latter). Now. with the release of Heroes Are Hard To Find, Weston is gone too.

But the real Fleetwood Mac is accenting the future – and right now that's the tour, a 43-date swing that ends December 1st – with yet another addition, Doug Graves on keyboards. "We can't complain," Fleetwood says. "This band has always been able to work when we wanted to."
t's a long way Jackson Browne has come — from his whining days at the Paradox in Orange, at the Dom in the Village, and at Troubadour hoots in Hollywood. No longer the high-schooler/songwriter with the unharnessed voice, Jackson has become a shiny, if not perfectly polished performer. With two successful albums — and even a hit single — behind him, he is a recording star. And, most recently, the man with the forever-young face has become a father.

But tonight, backstage at the Berkeley Community Theater, where he has just headlined, he is nervously shifting his weight from foot to foot, surveying the dressing-room cluster of old friends like a bashful birthday boy at his own surprise party. The faces from his past now drinking champagne from plastic cups are the people that have inspired and populated many of his songs.

He doesn't seem to believe their praises, to be able to absorb the backpats. The midpoint in his first major tour on top of the bill (with Linda Ronstadt as opener), the Berkeley show had been painfully mediocre. Jackson had seemed preoccupied between numbers and let his between-song stories wander pointlessly, spaced ellipses that led to nowhere.

In the end, the music triumphed and the audience forgot the spoken words. But he had tried too hard. Perhaps it was nervousness before his Orange County friends, but probably it was the disconcerting fact that he had suddenly been left in charge of his baby boy, Ethan, then eight weeks old. The baby's mother, Phyllis (the model, actress and star of the bar-fight/knock-up adventure described in Jackson's song, "Ready Or Not"), had taken ill and flown home to Browne's Highland Park mini-villa that afternoon. Only later, at a pizza parlor with high-school buddies Steve Noonan and Greg Copeland, and with fellow singers Paul Pena and Pamela Polland, among others, would Jackson finally relax. Saying good-night, he began wandering around in circles, until a circle of friends formed, joined hands and swayed through "Will the Circle Be Unbroken," each old friend taking a turn with a verse.

The next night, an out-of-the-way gig at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo had to be better. In fact, it was brilliant. With Jackson editing his stories down and alternating between guitar and piano, while the band (Doug Haywood on bass and perfect harmony, Larry Zack on drums, and David Lindley on violin, banjo and guitars) sounded superb, adding both depth and electricity to songs that before last spring had relied only on Jackson for instrumentation.

Back in his hotel room after the show, Jackson played with his baby for a moment, pushed aside the debris of past diaper-changing episodes, and fell into an easy chair. Last night was on his mind. "That was the first time most of those people had been together in the same room in God knows how long," he said. "I'll tell you, we used to sing freedom songs by the hundreds. It wasn't that we were such dedicated civil rights workers; it was just that we wanted to get it on. We'd stay up all night raising hell.

"There's a distance, a film between us now. Everybody's essentially the same; it's just the situations that have changed. I mean, I love those people, but I spend my time differently now. Anyway, those things are always very awkward at first." Ethan yawned squeakily.

JACKSON BROWNE RETURNED last year to the house in which he was raised from the time he was three to just before he became a teenager. Today the house is all baby and music, in a setting dreamt up and built a half-century ago by his grandfather, Clyde Browne.

There is no other house around like this one in Highland Park. But Clyde Browne, a printer who was considered by his disapproving wife to be an eccentric, was bent on recreating a California mission to be his home. He spent 12 years on it, beginning in 1915, called it "Abbey San Encino," and it would become home to his son, and then to his grandson, Jackson.

And now, on the parsons table in the living room, there is the birth certificate for Ethan Browne, born November 2nd, 1973, at 6:40 AM at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and there are the proud Polaroids — the kind that develop before your eyes — of Jackson and Phyllis taking turns holding the baby.

Boxes of Wipe Dipe are in both the living room and the adjoining bedroom, where the baby's crib sits at the foot of his parents' tattered-quilt-covered bed. On one shelf, tucked back against a wall, is an unopened box of It's a boy! Roi-Tan cigars. Outside, across the patio that serves as the cover of For Everyman, past the well and under the bambooed eaves of one walkway, a voice sings a lullaby in a foreign tongue. It is the housekeeper, a woman from San Salvador, and she is in the kitchen, cradling Ethan in her arms while his father is out shopping.

Down along the other side of the patio is the chapel, used by grandfather Browne as a print shop, but equipped with a 14-pipe Angeles organ that takes up the entire end wall. Wrapped around the bases of the four central pipes is a banner declaring: "Golden Notes from Leaden Throats."

Jackson uses the chapel as a rehearsal room, and these days, between tours, he is writing songs into an accounting record book propped up against the grand piano. He's on about page 105, at work on another song of retrospection, of the man looking back at the child: "In my early years I hid my tears and passed my days alone/Adrift on an ocean of loneliness/My dreams like nets were thrown ..."


And at the end of a snake dance of cords from amps and speakers, across from a small platform that serves as rehearsal stage, is a carrying case, ready for the next tour. It is white-stenciled:

JACKSON BROWNE
FRAGILE

Back from shopping, Jackson picks Ethan up and begins to pose for a photographer. He flips through the Polaroids and finds the one shot he'd like to duplicate: of him holding a broadly laughing Ethan. Back in the bedroom, he works with his free hand, slapping fingers together, and he makes gurgling noises and sings the refrain from "The Cover of Rolling Stone." Ethan laughs, and Jackson is as unknowingly open as his baby: "I love it when he laughs," he says. "His little voice. His little throat."

Jackson Browne is 25 years old now. He's been on the loose at least ten of those years. He hung onto friends older than he, losing them when they died or when he began to get into the business of music. He attracted lovers (or, as one of them put it, "pollinated every virgin in Southern California") and lost them (or, as he put it: "I got my heart crushed about eight times in a row. It would happen every two years or so; I'd forget and fall in love.").

Those years have gone into maybe 70 songs — his guess — and, since 1966, when he himself began to sing at hoots in Orange County, many of those songs have become standards in the portfolios of dozens of solo-sensitive singers, especially young women who populated hoot nights in Southern California, singing the heartcrush compositions of Jackson Browne.

Jackson became the Boy Wonder of song; he got the right kind of story published in Cheetah magazine in 1968, all about how he and Tim Buckley and Steve Noonan had become the Orange County Three (despite Browne's denials of any teamwork with Buckley and Noonan beyond one acid-soaked week in Venice beaches and caves). He got a mention in Rolling Stone in 1970 (from David Crosby, who called Jackson "one of the probably ten best songwriters around ... he's got songs that'll make your hair stand on end, he's incredible"). But he couldn't sing too well, and, aside from the hoots and occasional jobs, he stayed off the concert stage.

Now, with voice lessons behind him, he works, happily, in public. And he talks. Onstage, he appears to just stumble into stories. "That isn't stuff that I figured out before to say. It's all shit that I said one time or another. And it meant something to me at the time. It's just like playing an instrument. It's a lick."

Clever innocence is just one of Jackson Browne's licks. He is also the Reluctant Star — pure in his own mind, concerned mostly with the music and most impressed with friends like Gregg Allman and Ry Cooder, whom he hears as craftsmen, first of all. But understanding of the realities of the business. He loves David Lindley as a musician, but he also knows that he can pay Lindley better only if Jackson's albums do better. He doesn't like being in the position of hiring a backup band. He'd rather be in a band, like the Allmans or his friends, the Eagles. And yet, he reasons, "I have the best of both worlds. I have a band. And they do my tunes. But I feel a little weird. I'm an employer."

Schizo, schizo little star. Jackson wants to forget that "Boy Wonder" press about this California creampuff-teen-genius/Nico-lover-after-bragger but he keeps bringing up one particular article throughout our talks, and he grudgingly admits that yes, maybe he did kind of brag about being Nico's lover at age 18.

"The details of my life are very boring," he will say, and yet, as he himself warns, he'll go on for a half-hour per question; he just needs to be edited. The result is a story that is not at all boring, one that reflects California in the Sixties, how Orange County and the Haight-Ashbury were melded together by acid and music. And how this child of the Sixties, this songwriter for the Seventies, got started.

Jackson was born in Heidelberg, Germany, where his father was a civilian working, after the war, for Stars & Stripes, the Army paper. He was also a Dixieland pianist and, later, a teacher of English and journalism. When Jackson was three, the family moved back to Los Angeles, to Abbey San Encino. But when Jackson was 12, the Brownes, now including younger brother Severin and older sister Berbie, moved to Orange County.

"We were starting to become delinquents, carrying chains. This cop caught us smoking. I was 12. He told us to put 'em out and this guy with me gives him some lip. So it was, 'Empty out all your pockets.' A mini-arsenal. And it's only a block from my house. My father drives by and wants to know what's going on. Evidently it was his pack of cigarettes that I lifted, but they found all these chains and one or two of his really beautiful straight-edge razors from Germany. So we moved. My sister is a whole 'nother story  the razor blade and the ratted hair and all that. So they just moved out to Orange County and put us in this real sterile tract community.

"I got into music 'cause I couldn't get into athletics. I couldn't get into driving a GTO like some kids had. I just didn't have any money to dress. I would have done anything to wear a fucking varsity jacket. But I couldn't hang in there long enough. I ran some track and I did a little wrestling. That's what the skinny geeky kids do. And I blew it. The thing is, I was getting good at wrestling. And that's a fair sport. They put you with someone your own size. But football, man ... all my friends went out for football and like an asshole, I went out for football. And it was terrible. You're just fuckin' beating each other on the head and shoulders all afternoon. I cut practice all the time and they threw me out. They wouldn't let me go out for wrestling because they caught me cutting football, isn't that a bitch. No fucking flexibility, so then I was an outlaw, right? A desperado. From then on, music was left.


"This is at 14. By the time I was 15, I was hanging out with Steve Noonan and Greg Copeland; that got me writing, too. Greg Copeland was the poet laureate of the school; Noonan played bluegrass before school in the morning; they'd rip off a bass fiddle from the music department. Everybody always talks about how plastic Orange County is, but it's not. I mean all those blond-haired surfers who were into flashing a bareass at the old Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe are total blues fanatics and mushroom freaks. Silver surfers. I don't think L.A. was any more a legitimate music scene than Orange County, in the years we're talking about."

JACKSON DID SOAK in some L.A., though — from his mother, who turned him onto Zappa. "She read about him in the Free Press. She was into L.A. and the Free Press. She also introduced me to KPFK. She's a teacher, and she was always interested in freaks, kids." And Jackson watched TV rock, circa 1964:

"I remember watching the Lloyd Thaxton program one night and this pretty chick is singing 'You Won't Forget Me.' " Jackson sang a verse. "And it was beautiful. Suddenly he's talking to this chick, Jackie DeShannon, and he said, 'You wrote that song, didn't you?' and she said, 'Yes,' and I went, 'Wow. She made that up?' I didn't know where songs came from. I figured people got them from the supermarket or something. I had never thought about that. It really knocked me out." And of all the Byrds' folk-rock he was hearing, he especially liked "Don't Doubt Yourself, Babe," another song by Jackie DeShannon. Jackson decided to try some writing of his own.

He began with love songs. " 'Happy Woman Blues' was about just getting your ass kicked all the time by one chick. Mainly it was dumb shit, it wasn't so much out of experience as it was imitative.

"Steve and Greg were writing civil rights stuff, 'The Ballad of Rosette Park' — really powerful. I tried writing some civil rights songs, but it came out real stuffy-sounding. I never was too political or topical."

But Jackson Browne would grow up fast and accumulate experiences that would result in songs that would be recorded and spread by such artists as Tom Rush, Jennifer Warren and Steve Noonan.

"In '65 ... I was 16. My hair got real long because it just did. And A Hard Day's Night was out. It was magical. Down in Orange County and in San Francisco, people were getting incredible." And Jackson began to roam, to become part of this "great lysergic ... circuit." Along with his high-school buddies there was Roger, from the mountains near Palm Springs.

"Eventually, finally ... the first time I was on acid, Greg Copeland was taking us to the store 'cause Roger and I were prenatal idiots. And this cop ... I'm like  I'll get high if I start to tell you, but it was so funny  I just said [whispers], 'I wanna be this way all the time!' And it's nine o'clock in the morning and I'm screaming, 'Aaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrgh!' I'm ecstatic. And I'm pulling out these various different combinations of lint out of my pocket, and no two are the same. I had lent this coat to Steven Solbrook to work all summer in and I had it back. It was my favorite coat. I got it back and there was this treasure, and I'm spewing all this shit out. A cop rolls by and I'm screaming. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I was very happy, walking down the street, and he had to check it out. He put us all in the clink. And Greg, who's supposed to be looking after us, the only thing he said as we go shuffling into the back of the patrol car is, 'You mind telling us what you're doing to us?'

"Now, Roger looks like a fucking Breck ad. He's got shoulder-length, very beautiful blond hair and a very young sort of pubic reddish beard that only grows on the throat. And very pink skin. He's like a snail without a shell. And whatever happened, Roger wasn't gonna betray himself. The cop mumbled something about his beard. And Roger just said, 'Yeah, do you like it?' And he wasn't lipping off. The cop turned around, ready to just get really pissed off 'cause this guy was getting fresh, and he looked at me and then at Roger, who was looking at him with so much sincerity and innocence, and the cop was embarrassed to think this kid was gonna get fresh with him. He didn't know what to think, and he ContinuedContinued said, 'Well, you know, maybe you could trim it or something,' and Roger said, 'Oh, no, I couldn't do that.'

"I think probably a couple months after that, I wrote 'These Days.' That was the most definitive song from that period. It's a very tired song." Jackson, in fact, rewrote a line on it, going from "I'll stop my dreaming/I don't do that much scheming" to "I'll keep on moving/Things are bound to be improving" to cut down the meditative cynicism of the song.

"These Days," first recorded by Tom Rush in 1968, has only recently been brought back to life, by Ian Matthews, Gregg Allman and, finally, by Browne himself last year, on For Everyman.


"Over the years, I only felt that song about three or four times," he said. "I forgot all about it for about three years, and then I did it once, the time I met David Lindley. ... Jimmie Fadden [of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band] brought him up to the dressing room at the Troubadour and he wanted to play. I knew him from the Kaleidoscope and I knew he was great, and he brought his fiddle and, suddenly, the song had so much feeling because of the way he was reacting to the words. And the melody. And Jimmie playing harp on it. And then we went onstage and it wasn't anything like that. Puzzling. Then another time I felt it was when I played with David Bromberg and he played such beautiful shit with it. But all the time, it was a completely different song than the one we did [on Everyman]. It was folky. And then when I heard Gregg do it, there it was again. There was the song, the feeling."

"These Days" was written around the time of Jackson's second acid trip, two months after the first. "It wasn't on acid. ... Those moments are really blocked out of my mind." But not completely:

"It was great — the same guy, Roger. Here he is, we're both on acid at the breakfast table and his father proceeds to get hostile with him because of his appearance. He's still very Breck-like and rosy and he's wearing all black. Black Wellington shoes, black stretch Levis and black turtleneck, and he's wearing this big jewel around his neck because he's got to look the part. Flower child. He's got to look at everything through it. And I was just about to rub my eggs in my face because I was having a very sexual life-energy emotional trip with my food. I thought: 'Food — it keeps me alive!' And I was just about to go "Gruarrrrgh' and rub the eggs in my face, but this incredible wave of hostility comes down with me and Roger and something about 'What kind of son have we raised here?' And we're so high, there's no way of dealing with or talking with him. So I got very sober, very quick, and I calmed down and I finished as much as I could finish and walked outside where the clouds were doing this incredible number. Earl Carroll number. I went out there and I just went, 'Jeeez.' Great times."

Another growing-up-absurd friend of Jackson's was the inspiration for one of the most often requested songs in concert: "Song For Adam," the friend who committed suicide.

"He was this friend of Greg Copeland who had this great character. Although he was very salty and sarcastic, by the end of a month hanging out with him, we all really cared about each other. Greg and Adam went to Europe and wound up in Tangier and eventually India. I wanted to go, but I didn't have the money to do it. Adam was this biology freak, and people were down on him because once he took somebody's cat apart. This one girl that we knew was, surprisingly, seen with him. Everybody, you know, was already knocked up and had kids at the age of 16. ... There were these one or two girls that were keeping their virginity. They were every bit as "in" there with you and all, but they were 18 and they weren't about to fuck you, that's all. But this one chick, Adam's old lady, regarded him with some awe because he got her just like that [snaps finger]. They were living together. 'Liz is no longer a virgin? Who's the guy?' And he was this weirdo who dissected your cat if you weren't looking. But he was a high person. He was good. Very salty and very secretive. I didn't know him too good. They weren't in the same grade, they were two years older. Adam might have been three years older, he was Greg's friend. When they said, 'Do you want to come and drive across the country?' ... I really admired those guys. I went with them, but I didn't have the bread to go to Europe. I was just 17. Also, New York was such a ... number. I just wanted to get back to California where I knew a few people. When we got to New York, I hung out with Noonan, got a job singing at the Dom.

By the time he got his first gig in New York, Jackson had been hooting for a couple of years. He was even a short-term member of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in 1967, when he was 17. The band was just getting organized and Jackson stayed several months into the summer for gigs at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach and the Ice House in Pasadena. "Eventually it got so that I just couldn't ... my heart wasn't into playing ragtime music all the time. I wanted to play my own songs.

"We all started working professionally around the same time. I was playing at these clubs, at hoots and just hanging out. It was what I did on weekends."

In Orange County, the main hangout was the Paradox, a small, 200-capacity box that, along with its next-door neighbor, a 7-11 store, accounted for all the night lighting there was in the city of Orange. Regulars included Tim Buckley, Steve Noonan, Hoyt Axton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Penny Nichols, Dick Rossmini, and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee.

And this romantic kid, Jackson Browne.

"I remember seeing electric guitars when I was really tiny. I thought a guitar with a wire coming out of it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen. 'Cause I loved the whole beneath-the-trellis-with-the-guitar number. Or hunched over a guitar on the beach. That was another beautiful image to me. It was also a hell of a lot warmer than being out in the water. There was always a guitar when we'd go surfing."


Jackson became a regular. "For a while, people from school would come and hear me play. I got so that I was a draw because it was a novelty to go see somebody that you sat next to in school, onstage."

He became one of the bigger of the skinny geeks on campus — "for the last month or two," at least, "as a result of playing. 'Cause mostly in school they knew me as this guy that had got his heart stomped on early in the semester and was sort of out on the bench. I really, literally, spent the entire time  except for the classes  on this bench, just sitting there, staring off. This one chick just ruined me. Goddamn."

Did Jackson ever think of where the crusher might be today?

"I don't know. I hope that Wayne Seafelt took her and got a van and they became hippies somewhere  took acid and got beautiful."

One result of the Paradox hoots was Jackson's first step into recording, and finding a manager, Billy James. But while Jackson had songs like "These Days" and "Shadow Dream Song" already written by the end of senior year, he still wasn't ready. For one thing, despite the hoot-night workouts, he couldn't sing well. He remembered one time at Billy and Judy James' house, where he was staying, and writing:

"I wrote a melody way out of my range, way down low, because I didn't want to sing out. And you gotta sing something to know if it's right, if it sings well. And I don't want Billy and Judy to hear it because she's cooking dinner and he's in the other room, and I'm singing way up high and way low, and the whole house gets very quiet. Suddenly the door opens and it's Judy, saying, 'Are you all right? I said, 'Yeah, I'm all right. I'm writing a song.' She says, 'I thought there was somebody choking to death in here.' And she closed the door."

Jackson Browne's first recording contract was with Elektra, signed while he was still in high school, in 1966. It was a songwriting contract.

After graduation from Sunny Hills High, Jackson had gone East with his pals Greg and Adam, and stayed with Steve Noonan. He got a job at a Stony Brook concert with Tim Buckley and Noonan and followed Buckley into the Village, where Tim had a job opening for and accompanying Nico, Pop Girl of the Year with the Exploding Plastic Inevitable and the whole velvety underground as it was then laid out by Andy Warhol, who'd lent his name to this one club, the Dom. "Tim just got sick of singing in that environment, so he quit after a week, and I became her accompanist and also did the opening act. I did this for about six weeks and made untold hundreds of dollars and I ... just got out of it. Went back to Los Angeles. The next year, they put me on at Stony Brook again, this time opening for Judy Collins. I did a terrible set.

"The most significant thing about the whole New York experience at the Dom is that it was the first time I'd ever made $100 a week in my life. I made $10 a night at the Paradox and sometimes I would give it up because I knew it cost them that much to make the fucking cookies that week. I just said, 'Look, I don't need the money. I live at home. Thank you for the opportunity.' But this time I made a bunch of money, and in spite of the fact that I blew a lot of money, I came home with $500."

Of course, there were other significances.

"I'll tell you, I had a gigantic crush on Nico. She was so fucking beautiful. She fucked me around, really ... goddamn, man, she was just ... and I had seen these 20-foot-high posters of her for the three weeks I'd been in New York and then I went down and saw her — it was even my first time in a bar, I think, 'cause I'd just turned 18  and a week later I got a call, would I like to be her guitar player. I went over and got my brains fucked loose. It was much later, a month later, before I realized that the whole thing was just like this fling. I really cared about her in spite of the fact that I was real disappointed. I mean, I dug her."

Also, in New York, Jackson met Leonard Cohen. "That was real important. He used to come in because he was real infatuated with Nico, and he would sit there and write poems on the front table and just sit there and look at her. He'd write these perfect poems on little pieces of paper. He'd just knock them out in between songs and read them to us and get very dreamy. He was an old-fashioned poet, which was the only kind I knew there was. I was real impressed with him. I was no fixture at all in that scene. I made no impression on it.

"What R. Meltzer said in that article — that I became the object of many lustful old faggots  was not professional. Because I really didn't know what was going on. I mean, I realized it later, just remembering scenes of what people said to me. But it was like candy or something. I knew what a fag was, you understand, and I knew that when this outrageous transvestite came up and said he was Nico's little sister ... 'I'm Renee Ricard and I make movies with Andy' ... I knew what it was. It scared me. I kept my distance. "But these other people, these more menacing people ... Lou Reed, who always had this incredible menacing scowl on his face, wouldn't say more than one or two syllables because that was how Andy was. The conversations went like this" — Jackson drooped his lids and began a series of soft moans. Later, at a rehearsal session for Nico's Chelsea Girl album (Nico would record "These Days"), Jackson met Lou, who told him about the love-in that had taken place in New York that day, the same day of the be-in in San Francisco.


"Lou Reed is a sweetheart underneath. We got to rapping and he turned out to be this great person. And the way he described it, you realized there was a place for all that inside of him. He loved seeing Central Park full of people all just ... high and loving each other. I mean, you don't think about that when you think of all those Warhol people." In New York, Jackson said, he wrote "The Birds of St. Marks."

"No one's heard that song. It's a sad song, very strange."

WHEN JACKSON'S LABEL, Asylum, merged with Elektra Records last year, Jackson must've felt some irony, since he had first signed with Elektra in the fall of 1966 as a songwriter.

He had met Billy James, then a Columbia Records talent scout, through Pamela Polland, a Bob's Big Boy waitress-turned-singer (with the group Gentle Soul and then by herself). James, who managed Polland, advised Jackson against participating in an informal hoot album, to be sold at the Paradox. Billy tried to interest Columbia in Jackson, but the company didn't bite, and when James moved over to Elektra Records as West Coast director, he got Jackson signed in September 1966.

Songs began to find their way onto records: Tom Rush, on Elektra, recorded "Shadow Dream Songs," on The Circle Game, a 1967 album that also introduced unknown composers named Joni Mitchell and James Taylor.

But the most memorable product of that period was something Jackson dearly wants to forget: "Elektra made dubs and stuff," he said. "But they did a real foolish thing. They made up a dub of 30 songs and just passed them out like they were fucking periodicals. I sang them all in four hours and they were really bad. I just couldn't sing. They're still floating around somewhere. I personally have maimed 40 of them, but there were a hundred printed. They're ugly."

Within a year, James left Elektra, and the label released Jackson Browne. The next year — 1968 — Elektra would get interested again.

Meantime, Jackson was on the road. He did a concert in a town near Minneapolis that was put together by David Zimmerman, Bob Dylan's brother, and he visited David's apartment, "very ordinary except for this one Hieronymus Bosch over the fireplace," a gift from Bob. From there he went to New York, scored the Stony Brook job with Judy Collins and returned to L. A., where he nymphed away the summer of '68 in Laurel Canyon.

"These beautiful chicks from Peter Tork's house, they kept coming over with these big bowls of fruit and dope and shit. They'd fuck us in the pool. We'd wake up and see this beautiful 16-year-old flower child who only knew how to say 'fave rave,' with a bowl of fruit, get you incredibly high and then take you downstairs and go swimming." Other visitors Jackson remembered at musical jams around the house were David Crosby, whom he was meeting for the first time, and Stephen Stills. They were putting together a trio with Graham Nash. "We got this idea that we could have all these people come jam with us and we could be like ... right on the ground floor of a great repertory company."

Funny. Someone at Elektra Records was just thinking the same thing. The idea was known as the Elektra Music Ranch. Born August 1968, died March 1969, rest in peace.

This, one writer once close to Elektra explained, "was just an experiment. Elektra once tried to start a label run by young people ... they had the astrology records ... this was another idea: to establish a place for artists to work out, without the pressures to record."

The idea belonged to Barry Friedman, producer at Elektra and co-founder of another innovation, a seven-man supergroup called Supergroup (later renamed Rhinoceros) — and Jac Holzman, president of Elektra, approved. These were the days, you see, of Big Pink — of hanging out and letting the music flow out, as if by communal magic.

Friedman found a piece of land in Paxton, California, 150 miles north of Sacramento in the Plumas National Forest, two plane trips and a jeep ride away from Hollywood. Friedman found an 18-room resort hotel that had done time, successively, as a whorehouse and an alcoholic dry-out camp. He rented it and installed a remote recording unit, with the controls located in what would become his own bedroom.

Patti Faralla, publicist at the time with Elektra, explained further: "There'd been a lot of talk about taking people out of the urban situation, so they could make music without worrying about phones and traffic and meetings. Other companies thought it was an amazing idea. Another reason for the ranch was that Elektra hoped to form the Los Angeles Fantasy Orchestra  your basic house band  to back solo artists on the road. There was no orchestra. They hoped it would evolve from those people." And who were those people?

"All of the people were very young, experimenting with their lifestyles and their music. That caused some problems. There was a lot of drugs, and there were a lot of people trying to make musical relationships with people they just didn't know."

At any rate, for Jackson Browne, it just didn't work.

"It turned out to be crazy, incredible jive. The record company  and this is the way these corporate things happen  they needed an album to promote the music ranch. A month after we got there, it was: 'God, you know what it's cost us to have this thing up here 24 hours a day?' And we didn't get away from the cost and pressure of doing an album. So there we were, concepting ourselves right out of music. What we wanted was to be a fantasy orchestra, like a repertory company where, say, Crosby would come and sing with us, and we can get this guy to come up for a couple days. ... It was that fantasy that everybody's had at one time or another. A repertory of artists that all help each other.

"Well, that exists. Only they call it Hollywood, or Nashville."


Another problem at Paxton: girls, the lack thereof. "They were all men up there," said one woman who had firsthand knowledge of the music ranch. They stopped writing love songs." As Jackson tells it in concert, three girls were imported up to Paxton, but that caused more problems.

In his San Luis Obispo hotel room, he elaborated. "There was this one chick who was fucking brainless. We had to tell her what a douche was. 'Janis, would you please tell Connie what a douche bag is? Please hurry, because ... it's getting bad.' You know, she'd fuck like four of us without douching and a week later, man  And I tried to have an old lady up there. I tried to fall in love with this chick."

After nine months and at least $75,000 down the drain, the ranch was closed down. "It fell apart," said Jackson. "It should have." But before it did, "They made us [several musicians who'd been trying solo albums] be a group and we named it after a tombstone in a local cemetery, the Browning Family Plot, and it just said 'baby,' an unnamed stillbirth. So we named the group Baby Browning, very unhappily concluding an album that no one liked, and I didn't even like my part in it. So the album was a disaster and they kicked me off Elektra. Next thing I knew, they didn't want my publishing. I said, 'What do you mean you don't want my publishing?' And they said, 'We don't want your publishing if you're not gonna be on the label.'"

Jackson slumped into a dry spell, surfacing to write the song, "Opening Farewell." His friend Noonan, who'd been signed while Jackson was staying with him the first time in New York, joined VISTA.

Back in L.A., Jackson did some hoot nights at the Troubadour — he had auditioned there before, between trips to New York — and would be hired in the fall of 1969 by owner Doug Weston as an opening act for Linda Ronstadt.

But he was entertaining thoughts of giving up trying to get himself on records. The lesson from the music ranch, he said, was that "you had to be serious about what you were doing, and that it took a lot to make a record, and you couldn't just float into the studio. Maybe Bob Dylan did, from all accounts, and maybe I had to cope with the fact that I wasn't Bob Dylan. And I suddenly realized that I wasn't gonna get to be Bob Dylan."

A humble Billy James explains Jackson's split from him: "I wasn't able to move him as fast as he was ready to move. I don't do deals all that well."

David Geffen does. And through the Crosby, Stills and Nash vine, Jackson had heard of Geffen. He made up a demo, with Glenn Frey of the Eagles and J.D. Souther (now working with Richie Furay and Chris Hillman in a new group) behind him. "I went to Colorado. From there I was gonna go to New Mexico and check out the communes. You can make bricks or something. There's all kinds of things to do, 'cause it was getting really depressing here. And I came back; it turned out he had been trying to get a hold of me.

"Geffen is this compulsive — not now — but at the time he was just this person who gets up in the morning and wheels and deals and is always on the phone and by nightfall he's like, 'Oooooooh. I can't stand this any more. I hate it.' Anyway, six months after the Troubadour, I got with Geffen. I thought he might be able to find me a manager or something and I figured that if he encouraged me, then I would do it, and if he didn't, then I wouldn't. I didn't want to go the route of some of those people who'd given me offers, and I knew better than to hang out in the Troubadour." Geffen told Jackson to relax. Meantime, Geffen formed Asylum Records, and Jackson found a producer: Richard Orshoff, who'd engineered for Johnny Rivers. And he took voice instruction.

"I don't want to put down the way I sing. I'm not gonna spoil it for anybody who thinks I'm good. I know when I'm singing well, but I haven't sung well on record yet. I got a ways to go."

THE FIRST ALBUM was finished in October 1971 and held off until January, away from the Christmas-rushed market. Met by critical acclaim and boosted further by the hit single, "Doctor My Eyes," Jackson got scared again, and his next album would be a year and a half in coming. He had become self-conscious.

"You get the impression that you know what it was that they liked about it, and you try to do that again. You just fall into a bunch of pitfalls and it takes a long time to get yourself out of them. I think my foremost problem was that it got very important to write heavy songs. I mean, I never thought they were heavy when I wrote them, but gradually I got the impression they were by the way people related to them. That's a bad connection — I'm taking someone else's word for them. That's what fame does. It's a crusher. And that makes me respect people like Gregg and Dicky Betts and their band all that much more. And I respect Elton John because he's kept going, because he thinks it's a joke. I admire him for being a pop star. I don't want to do that, but he does what he does, and then there's who he is. He just wants to jump over the piano in his neon hot pants. No pretense. 'They want me to be a pop star? OK, I'll do that. OK.' Dylan did that, too. 'You want a mysterioso whatever, I'll give him to you.' "


These days, Jackson is bolstered by friends he's had since the pre-Asylum days, friends who have joined him on the label. Chief among them are the Eagles. He met Glenn Frey (who would add the Winslow, Arizona, lyrics to "Take It Easy") and John David Souther five years ago at a free-clinic benefit in Long Beach. He had seen Frey and Souther perform before, and he wanted them to try this new song of his, "Jamaica Say You Will." "We were floored," Said Frey. They ended up sharing what Souther called "this adobe matchbox that was already halfway rolled down the hill," in the Echo Park sector of Los Angeles.

"There's no wasted words or filler in his tunes," said Frey. "Fuck, that kid's a monster. Jackson's trip is multidimensional. It's there musically and lyrically. It makes it a little harder to gain commercial acceptance, but when you do get it, it's longer lasting. To get right down to it, I'm in awe of him. I've seen audiences go through changes during 'Song For Adam' that were unbelievable."

"The first thing we ever tried writing together," said Souther, "was the stuff that was on our Desperado album. Ned Doheny [another Asylum artist — he'd been part of the Elektra Music Ranch] laid a book about gunfighters on us. It had a chapter in it about the Doolin-Dalton gang. We started talking about it, ranting and raving through the night about the role of the outlaw and using that as a metaphor.

"We've kicked the idea of all of us being in one group around a lot," said Souther. "We always refer to each other as the White Temptations. It would be a lot of fun if we ever found the time."

And there is David Lindley, the instrumental showman of Jackson's band, called "The Lindley Brothers" because he handles so many instruments: guitar, slide, steel, Hawaiian steel, banjo and violin. Jackson first saw him at a club in Redondo Beach.

"I had never met him there, though," said Lindley, "and for a good reason. He was underage and the management would scratch a hole in the painted-over windows so that Jackson could watch. He looked like he was about 12 years old. He still looks the same now. I have no doubt Jackson will look that way forever."

And there is David Geffen. Although Jackson got new management shortly after Geffen became chairman of the merged Elektra/Asylum, he says he's close to the former agent/manager. "He's done it for me. All I have to do is keep on making records and whatever my slice of the pie is, I'm gonna get. He's already broken me."

But here's the bottom line: Jackson, like some of his songs, goes apocalyptic: "I think the whole fucking thing is coming down. I think it's all over. There are hundreds of people in the woods of Vancouver and Oregon and New Mexico who make music and entertain themselves but happen to do something else for a living. As David Lindley has been known to say, 'Plastic begets plastic.'

"When do I think it's all gonna come down? Seventies, Eighties, Nineties, it doesn't matter. The way things are in this world, the fact that people live in square rooms and they go to bars and shit ... you know, I used to think it was so lame to go to bars, but now I go to bars. On the other hand, the moment is everything. I can't deny that I'm from Southern California and I dig going to get a beer, I wanna get high, I wanna enjoy it. I don't want to pretend to be a spaceman. Fuck that shit. I'm just what I am and that's however good it is."

Throughout the interview, Jackson Browne has kept an eye, an ear out for Ethan. When it seems too clammy, he turns down the heater. Now he's talking about being a father: "I wanted a baby 'cause I wanted to be a baby. I play with him all the time; there's something pure about it. Look at all those expressions he's got. He's a real kick in the ass."

Baby as toy; baby as mirror. Has Jackson grown up and become a father, or is he still as childish as he looks? In "Ready Or Not," the story of how he came to be settled down with one woman  and even made the gesture of Commitment by buying her a washing machine  he asks for advice: "Take a look in my eyes and tell me, brother, do I look like I'm ready?"

The final question: Are you ready?

Jackson let go with a sure, let's-go smile. "Yeah, I'm ready," he said.

Jackson Browne has just one more story: the first time he ever met Bob Dylan, at the Roxy in Hollywood last year, where Jackson was performing. During a break, someone, he remembers, invited him to sit down. "And I'm talking to this guy. Then somebody comes from behind and says, 'This is Bob Dylan,' and I turned around and he suddenly looked like a monolith. He looked like Easter Island. He's wearing a fucking fur cap, he's got his shades on, gloves and a coat. I just looked at him, said 'Hi,' and he gave me this sort of imperceptible nod of the head, and I thought, 'Jesus Christ, excuse me.' And I split. I didn't know how to deal with it. There it was  that mouth, that jaw, those eyes, that inscrutable presence.

"It scared me to death. I went next door and got a drink."
accent comes up out of Nashville, by way of Georgia, makes a dash across the States and ends up vaguely California. He sounds a bit like Kris Kristofferson; looks uncannily like his late brother, Duane. The hotel television is on; the sound is off. It is late, and the black and white movie — something surely about horror and death at this small hour — glows up on Gregg Allman's tired face like a moonscape in Macon's Rose Hill Cemetery.

Rose Hill is where the band — the Allman Brothers Band — went in the lean scuffling days, back when they all lived in a two-room, $50-a-month apartment. Sometimes they'd eat psilocybin for inspiration. Sometimes a lonely, bluesy wail would rise out of that old graveyard: a song like Dicky Betts' "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed." It was a grassy, quiet place to be alone together and to talk about music, and love, and finite thoughts. In later years, Duane Allman would be buried there and the band would play a deeply felt set at the funeral in his memory. Bassist Berry Oakley, too, would die, ominously almost a year to the day after Duane. Eerily, the circumstances of the accident would — even the place where it happened — recapitulate the tragedy of Duane Allman. And Berry Oakley would be buried at Rose Hill.

Gregg Allman stares moodily at the silent television. The writer is asking him about the band's latest successes: about the rave reviews of their two-week long West Coast tour, about the new album, Brothers And Sisters, topping the charts. All six of their albums have now made over a million dollars; most have sold over a million units. In the past six months the Brothers have grossed between $50,000 and $100,000 on an average night. They headlined before 600,000 at Watkins Glen, and though an agreement with the promoter prevents an official statement on the Allmans' gross, a spokesman for Capricorn Records, the Brothers' company, states flatly that it was "astronomical." They have played to sell-out crowds in America's largest arenas and stadiums.

But Gregg Allman's mind, this quiet night after a tour de force marathon set at San Francisco's Winterland, is back in Macon, at Rose Hill. "The real question," he says, "is not why we're so popular. I try not to think about that too much. The question is what made the Allman Brothers keep on going. I've had guys come up to me and say, 'Man, it just doesn't seem like losing those two fine cats affected you people at all.'

"Why? Because I still have my wits about me? Because I can still play? Well that's the key right there. We'd all have turned into fucking vegetables if we hadn't been able to get out there and play. That's when the success was, Jack. Success was being able to keep your brain inside your head."

DUANE AND GREGORY ALLMAN were born in 1946 and 1947 in Nashville, Tennessee, just as the city was experiencing its first studio-building boom. In 1949, the boys' father, an Army first lieutenant, returned home from the Korean War for the holidays. The day after Christmas, he picked up a hitch-hiker ... who murdered him.

"You've got to consider why anybody wants to become a musician anyway," Gregg says. "I played for peace of mind."

The boys' mother, Geraldine "Mama" Allman, went to school and became a CPA. "Somebody suggested that she put us in an orphanage. She politely told them to fuck off and we went to Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee. I couldn't get it on in school worth a shit."

In 1958, the family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida. In the summer of 1960, 13-year-old Gregg took a summer job as a paperboy. "Worked all summer and cleared 21 bucks. It was getting toward the end of summer, the mornings were getting colder and I was in Sears and Roebuck to get some gloves with the money when I strolled by the guitar department and fell in love with those beauties. Found one that was $21.95 and the bastard behind the counter wouldn't let me have it. I came back the next day, got it, and proceeded to wear that son of a bitch out. I wouldn't eat or sleep or drink or anything. Just play that damn guitar."

The same summer, Duane Allman bought his first motorcycle, a small Harley. Gregg remembers the bike with a bittersweet smile and a small shake of the head. "Duane was sure a bastard when he was a kid," Gregg says with real admiration. "He quit school, I don't know how many times. Got thrown out a few times too. But he had that motorcycle and drove it until it finally just fell apart. When it did, he quit school. While I was gone, he'd grab my axe and start picking. Pretty soon we had fights over the damn thing, so when it came around to our birthdays — mine was in December and his was in November — we both got one. I got mine a little earlier than my birthday, actually. Matter of fact, I put hands on my first electric guitar November 10th, 1960, at three o'clock that Saturday afternoon, Duane's guitar got into the picture shortly after that."

Gregg gave the Sears guitar to a family friend and it is probably still somewhere in Daytona Beach the way Gregg last saw it; painted flat black with gold strings on it and containing two potted plants.

The Allmans took their electric guitars to led Connors, "a really intense cat who knew how to teach. He's probably still down there. He didn't teach any of that bullshit minute waltz business. I said, 'Man, I want to learn some goddamn Chuck Berry music!" ... and he taught me."

While Gregg muttered and cursed his way through Sea Breeze Senior High School. "Duane stayed at home in the woodshed and got very good. Very fast. The local R&B station was always on and he had some old Kenny Burrell, Robert Johnson and Chuck Berry albums that he'd listen to over and over again to get the structure down. Duane Allman was the best guitar player. I ever heard who didn't read a note."

After a year of practice, Duane and Gregg were playing with local bands like the Shufflers, the Escorts, the Y-Teens. "The social scene in Daytona Beach was simple," Duane Allman once said, "the white cats surf and the blacks play music."The Allmans, of course, played music, and in 1963, in the era of civil rights marches and murders, Gregg and Duane joined a mixed band, the House Rockers.

"That's when the trouble started in the family." Gregg recalls. "Going to play with them niggers again? We had to turn my mother on to the blacks. Took awhile, but now she's totally liberated."


Duane never quite finished high school, but Gregg graduated in 1965. "That summer we went on the road as the Allman Joys. We had our own sound system, amps and a fucking station wagon. Big time. Our first gig was in Mobile, at a place called the Stork Club. Boy, it was a nasty fucking place. I was homesick and the band had broken up about 14 times before we got there."

Significantly, the internal bickering and the homesickness faded away as soon as the band began playing live club dates. It is as if the band draws its strength and determination from being "the hottest band around." They not only stayed on the road, they worked seven nights a week, six sets a night. Joe Tex' manager caught the Allman Joys at one of the Southern teen clubs and they eventually recorded two albums' worth of material for his label, Dial Records. One single was released, a "terrible psychedelic" version of Willie Dixon's "Spoonful" which went mercifully unnoticed. After listening to the other tracks, Killen advised the band to "go look for a day job."

While a year of constant playing and touring strengthened Gregg and Duane's determination and musicianship, it devastated drummer Manard Portwood, who was eventually fired. The bass, Bob Keller, was in and out of the band, trying to straighten up troubles with his wife, One of the two percussionists in the present Allman Brothers Band, Butch Trucks, played the same club circuit with his band the Bitter End and sometimes sat in with the Allman Joys.

The Allman Joys crumbled in St. Louis in early 1967. They were drummerless, and the new bass, Billy Canell, enlisted in the Navy to beat the draft. The pickup bass was caught trying to make off with the brothers' equipment. "We stole his bass and told him to get the fuck out," Gregg says. "Sent his ass home."

Which is pretty much the way the Allmans handled such problems a few years ago. Things have changed a bit. When the fired drummer, Portwood, went out on the road a few months ago with a new band, he billed himself as "the original drummer for the Allman Brothers Band," a cheap but embarrassing gimmick that raised hackles on Gregg's neck. "We sent an attorney out there to talk that over with him," he says without particular emphasis, as if this is the way civilized folks deal with irritating problems.

In '67, following the demise of the Joys, Gregg and Duane were living out of a van without so much as a telephone to contact a lawyer, or anyone else. They cruised on down to Nashville, and combined forces with drummer Johnny Sandlin, keyboard artist Paul Hornsby, and a "cat called the Wolf" on bass: part of another fragmented band called the Five Minutes. "They were a strong outfit," Gregg says, "and they were stuck without a singer or a guitarist. It all fell together and we started cooking." The new band played Nashville as the Five Minutes, then rambled back up Highway 41 to St. Louis and used the name Allman Joys.

"There were posters all over," Gregg says. "THE ALLMAN JOYS ARE BACK! That band was really tight, playing R&B and Yardbirds tunes by the hundreds. Duane loved the early days of Jeff Beck."

One night the then high-riding Nitty Gritty Dirt Band stopped into a St. Louis club to hear the Allman Joys. Their manager, Bill McKuen, was impressed. He told the group that they didn't have to play the Southern club circuit, and that they could easily make it nationally. All they had to do was come out to California and he would take them under his wing. "Just come out and see what you think ... ."

Gregg wasn't so sure it was all that good an idea. He was happy playing live club dates to wildly enthusiastic audiences and had the gut feeling that he wasn't going to get to play in California.

"I said, 'No, Duane. that's a jive lick. Let's don't do it.' He said, 'C'mon man, we'll go to L.A. We'll see all those pretty women and fine looking cars.' What could I say? It was unanimous."

In the end, it was Gregg who was right. The group signed with Liberty Records under the name of Hour Glass, "The record company's line," Gregg says, "was, 'We'll make you the next Rolling Stones.' All we wanted to do was play, but they wouldn't let us do live dates. We would have done small clubs in the valley, but they told us we'd blow the whole image if we did that. What did we know? They'd dress us up in these funny fucking duds and we just felt silly."

Liberty picked the material for the two Hour Glass albums, Hour Glass ("a pendulum of psychedelic and soul ..." read the liner notes), and Power of Love. Though the material was good — Jackson Browne and Carole King compositions were included — it was not the Allmans' music. Furthermore, they hadn't played enough to live audiences and it sounded stiff, like the tracks on the Liberty LPs.

"We were misled," Duane once said of the Liberty period. Gregg is a bit more blunt. "Together those two records form what is commonly known as a shit sandwich." Neither record sold, and the band was in debt. "Liberty, was paying all our expenses for us until we earned enough to pay them back." But a company pays only so much money on losing items and soon Hour Glass was. "groveling for money just to get a burger." It got worse.


"We stayed first at the Mikado Motel, then at the Cahuenga down by the Hollywood Bowl. A real garbage motel. and all of us in one room. The manager caught us and we moved down to an even worse joint on Lash Lane. This place had no name at all. I got up the first morning we lived there, thinking I'd go swimming. As I'm walking down the hall, there was this door open. I happened to look in and there's this cat lying on the floor, covered up with a blanket. Cop standing there. The cat had left a note and downed 95 Seconals. It was the first dead person I'd ever seen."

The dead man in that sleazy room weighed on the brothers' minds. The same kind of down, dead thing was happening to their spirits and their music. "I think that's when we knew the whole L.A. scene had gone sour on us. Duane got fed up and when my brother got fed up, he got fed up. 'Fuck this' he kept yelling. 'Fuck this whole thing. Fuck wearing these weird clothes. Fuck playing this goddamn 'In a Gadda-da-Vida' shit. Fuck it all!'"

Hour Glass packed up and headed east, to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Fame studios, where they taped some of their own material without outside interference. Some of these tracks, including the "B.B. King Medley," appear on Duane Allman/An Anthology. After the sessions, Hour Glass split and Duane and Gregg took the van to Jacksonville, Florida, where their friend and sometimes pickup drummer. Butch Trucks, was preparing to record an album with his band (now called the 31st of February).

The Allmans worked on the LP as sidemen, and were paid as such. At one point in the sessions, Truck's lead singer was not around to do vocals, so Gregg sang through a few of the tracks in rehearsal. An album of those outtakes has recently been released as Duane Allman and Gregg Allman, on Bold Records. A 31st of February album was never released, which is just as well with Trucks, since he now considers his work on those sessions excruciatingly embarrassing.

Meanwhile, the ghost of L.A. and past expenses began looming over the Allmans. Gregg got a call from Liberty "telling me to get my ass back to California, or they'd sue us for $48,000 that Hour Glass still owed them." For the first and only time in their musical careers, Duane and Gregg split. In L.A. Liberty recorded a solo album with Gregg Allman-and, as expected, they did it their way. "They did all the arrangements and all the songs. It was a 26-piece studio band and it was like they said, 'Stay in the corner, out of the way boy. We're cutting you an album.'"

Duane stayed in Jacksonville, hanging out at a club called the Scene and jamming with the Second Coming whose line-up included future Allman Band members: Berry Oakley on bass and lead guitarist Dicky Betts. Belts remembers that the Second Coming did "double lead guitar; the same sort of thing that Duane and I did later. A guy named Larry Rheinhardt and I would do twin guitar runs for 30 bars or so. Fast harmony playing. Which is where Duane and I got the idea for doing that kind of thing, only we did it much better, later."

Back at Muscle Shoals, Fame studios owner-operator Rich Hall was gearing up for an important Wilson Pickett session. Remembering Duane Allman's work with Hour Glass, he sent a telegram to Jacksonville. Duane jumped at the chance for a paying job. He suggested that Pickett record the Beatles tune, "Hey Jude." Wilson refused to sing any song with the refrain "Hey Jew." Eventually enlightened, he cut a track with Duane on lead guitar. It sold a million singles, and Duane was invited to stay in Muscle Shoals and play with some of the finest musicians in the country.

Rick Hall signed Duane to a contract. That paper was purchased by Atlantic VP Jerry Wexler on the strength of Duane's guitar work with Pickett. Wexler then sold the contract to Phil Walden, the young manager of Sam and Dave and Otis Redding. Walden was putting together a roster for his Atlantic custom label, Capricorn Records.

It was at Fame that Duane met Jai Johanny Johanson, a knock-around drummer who had worked behind the late Otis Redding, Percy Sledge and Joe Tex, among others. The two formed a fast friendship and Duane told Jaimo that whatever his next move was, he wanted Jaimo to be his drummer. "People ask me things like. 'Was I in the original band?'" Jaimo says. "Shit, I was with the band when it wasn't no band."

Also at Fame, Duane cut a solo album with Berry Oakley and Sandlin and Hornsby from Hour Glass. The only track Duane ever liked was "Going Down Slow." a haunting blues tune on which he makes a rare vocal appearance. "He wasn't really hot on doing the solo album." Dicky Betts says. "See, Rick Hall wanted him to do a Hendrix power-trio thing. But Duane was too warm and personal for that. He needed a lot of other guys to get that full sound he wanted."

In search of those musicians and with the Capricorn-Walden contract in hand, Duane moved back to Jacksonville with Jaimo. They slept on the floor at Butch Trucks' place and took to jamming Sunday afternoons in the park. It took four or live Sundays to hit the right note; the day of the Legendary Jacksonville Jam, as Trucks calls it. "We set up at Oakley's house. Duane was there, so was Dicky and Jaimo and Berry and myself. We played three or four hours without stopping and when we finished, Duane looked around and said, 'Man, this is it.' He got on the phone and called Gregg in California."


That was March 23rd, 1969. In an introspective mood in the late hours of the night, Gregg once wrote a letter to a friend about his lonely California days. "I had been building up nerve to put a pistol to my head," he said. Depending on his degree of sincerity and Gregg asks that he be taken seriously on that — that call from Jacksonville may have saved his life. Despite his continuing debt to Liberty, Gregg left a note "and caught the first thing smokin' toward Jacksonville."

After nearly five years of squalor and frustration, of roadhouse and studio playing, the final and ultimate Allman Brothers Band had been formed. It was to be marked by a fanatic familial closeness, by talent and determination, and tragedy.

The Allman Brothers Band moved to Macon, where manager-label president Phil Walden was setting up Capricorn studios. In the first weeks they lived in a house at 309 College Street: two rooms with a bath and a kitchen that didn't work, Walden bought five or six double mattresses, and the whole band lived there with occasional female visitors from nearby Wesleyan College.

Twiggs Lyndon, the band's first road manager, remembers that, "The band lived there a while and when we began to get $100-a-night gigs, Duane moved a block and a half away and Dicky moved down the street. At the foot of College Street is this old cemetery, Rose Hill. We all used to go down there and have a good time. Dicky, would sometimes go down there at night with his acoustic guitar and write songs. In fact, most of the songs from the first album, The Allman Brothers Band, came out of writing done at Rose Hill.

The most famous of the Rose Hill songs is Betts' "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed." "I wrote that song for a certain person," Dicky says, "but I didn't know what to call it. There was a tombstone nearby that read In Memory of Elizabeth Reed, so that's what I called the tune. Some writer once asked me how I wrote the song and Duane said, 'Aww, he fucked some girl across a tombstone and that's what it's about.' Don't you know that got printed in an instant. You can imagine how the girl I wrote it for felt after that."

With the new material rehearsed, the band chose an agent and set out on the road doing nearly 500 dates in two years. "For a long time," says Butch Trucks, "our only mode of travel was an Econoline van. Eleven of us, with nine sleeping in the back on two mattresses. The only way we made it was with a great big old bag of Mexican reds and two gallons of Robitussin HC. Five reds and a slug of HC and you can sleep through anything."

The first two or three tours bombed but, says Trucks. "Phil Walden had complete faith in us, and I'll respect him forever for that. I think he sunk about $150,000 in us. He was close to bankruptcy a lot of the time and Atlantic kept telling him we didn't have a chance. But during that first three years, Phil never once tried to change us."

The Allman Brothers Band was released in 1970. It was a moderate critical success, but didn't do much for the band's financial status. "We found out in New York once that we had to be at the Fillmore West in a week," Twiggs remembers. "We barely had enough money to make it and when we came across the Golden Gate Bridge, we couldn't scrape up the toll between 11 of us. We had to park and go around hitting up people. 'Hey, we're the Allman Brothers and we're playing the Fillmore. We'll let you in free if you give us a dime... .'"

By the time Idlewild South, the second Allman Brothers album, was released, the band had picked up a growing and dedicated audience. More attention was focused on the group after Duane's work with Eric Clapton on Layla. Even though Duane appeared once or twice with Derek and the Dominoes, roadie Red Dog says, "He never forgot about the Allman Brothers Band. He might be out there playing for a week, a week and a half, then he'd have to come back.... He was the father of the family."

By October of 1971, the third album, The Allman Brothers Band at the Fillmore East, was on its way to the top of the charts and million-selling status. There were overflow crowds at every stop, and it seemed time, after two years on the road, to take a short vacation and enjoy some success.

It was on that vacation that Duane Allman was fatally injured in a motorcycle accident. "The night before he got killed," says Red Dog, "Duane and I were talking. We had just gotten into Macon a couple of days before. 'We've got it made now,' he said. 'We're on our way. Ain't gonna be no more beans for breakfast.'"

The next day, October 29th, 1971, Duane visited the Oakley house to wish Berry's wife, Linda, a happy birthday. Shortly after leaving the house about 5:45 PM — he swerved to avoid a truck which was moving in the same direction, but which he had apparently not seen in time after it turned onto the street. The cycle skidded and flipped over, dragging Allman nearly 50 feet. He died of massive injuries at the age of 24.

Stricken and grieving, the band returned to Macon from various vacation sites. There was no question in anyone's mind: The band would carry on. They played at the funeral in Macon's Memorial Chapel: a hollow, moving set; and joined hands with folks like Dr. John and Delaney Bramlett to sing "Will the Circle Be Unbroken."

A month later, they made good on two scheduled Carnegie Hall dates, then threw themselves into feverish work completing the fourth album, Eat A Peach, released in early 1972. And success, like tragedy, dogged the band.


But the real question, as Gregg Allman puts it, is not why the Brothers are popular; it is how they managed to survive the loss of their driving force, the focus of their energy, the "father of the family."

"I think," says a close friend of the Brothers, "that Duane's loss was much more traumatic than anyone realizes. He was pretty arrogant sometimes, and I think one critic said he had 'an ego that could fill the Grand Canyon,' but he had a talent to match. Most of the guys at that funeral were stuporous with grief, but they handled it beautifully, and I think you really have to look at it communally. Duane's death was like an amputation. The organization cauterized the wound and tried to forget about it. They had to.

"See, most of the Brothers are from rural areas in the South, from tight, close-knit families. They took their new identity partially from Duane and partially from the band. When Duane died, the question of identity became paramount. They switched their total allegiance to the family: The constant mention of brothers and sisters isn't any sham. It's a necessity.

"But if the band hadn't made it, it would have fractured the structure of their identities. They had to be successful, and if they hadn't — in 1971 anyway — I think each and every one of those guys could have tumbled off the deep end in some way."

For a while there was talk that the Brothers were looking for a replacement for Duane, but the idea was never discussed within the band. Betts tells why. "I think replacing Duane would have been one of the most uncreative morbid moves anyone could make. It would have cheapened our whole organization to hire someone and teach him Duane's licks."

The first few tours in 1972 weren't easy for the band. "We played some blues, let me tell you," Trucks says, sadly. "We still do. There's one place in our set... and it's for Duane. I'm not going to tell you exactly what or where it is, but it's always there. I feel it every night we play. We all do."

The new album, Brothers And Sisters, was begun last spring, and keyboard artist Chuck Leavell joined the band early in the sessions. He has added to the Allman sound, and freed them from an exclusive blues base. "I don't think I've changed the band as much as broadened them," Leavell says.

Most of the Brothers believe that it was the new musical direction that brought Berry Oakley out of a year-long depression he had suffered after Duane Allman's death. "When Duane died," Red Dog says, "Berry died. He loved and idolized Duane. For quite a few months, that's all he thought about. He was obsessed with Duane."

Oakley's playing degenerated, and though the band doesn't admit it, there had been some vague thought given to perhaps replacing him. "He wasn't himself during that time," Jaimo says. "He had lost all interest. Then when we got Chuck in the band, it was like seeing the light. He was back being the old Berry again, playing his ass off. Then it happened."

Not long after the band cut the best-selling "Ramblin' Man," Berry Oakley's motorcycle slammed into a Macon city bus. He was thrown 20 yards and died several hours later of a brain concussion. The accident occurred only three blocks from the site of Duane Allman's fatal crash, a year and two weeks later. Both were 24. Both are buried at Rose Hill Cemetery.

"It was so hard to get into anything after that second loss," Gregg says. "I even caught myself thinking that it's narrowing down, that maybe I'm next."

Typically, the Brothers chose to drown this kind of morbid speculation in hard work. Three weeks after the accident, the band began auditioning bassists. Lamar Williams had played with some soul groups before his Capricorn audition, but he had listened hard to the previous Allman records. At one point in the jam. Lamar stopped a band member and tactfully pointed out that he hadn't played his part correctly. Williams got the job, and now, almost a year later, says he feels "quite at home."

Still, it was a difficult thing in get in the studio and finish up Brothers And Sisters. Sometimes the band would spend a month on a single rhythm track. The record was finally released. It was an overnight gold record that gathered well-earned critical praise.

Recently, both Dicky Betts and Gregg Allman have been working on solo albums — Gregg's Laid Back was recently released. Rumors that either of them will soon embark on a solo career "are horseshit," Gregg says. Betts, who has taken to dressing a bit like a young Nashville sideman, has established the North American Indian Foundation, an organization designed to "raise money for the Indian people through benefits and fund-raisers."

Gregg still dresses in the patchy street style of his shuffling days. Last month he took a fancy to a $44,000 burgundy-black Rolls-Royce. He strolled into the New York showroom on little more than a whim and informed the salesman that he'd write a check for the Rolls in the window.

"I should have known they'd want cash," Gregg says. "Fucking cash! They must figure I go around carrying a suitcase full of bucks. I told them to stick it. Good Lord, to get that much money from my bank up there they wanted 20%. Isn't that shitty?"

Maybe so, but it's also a far cry from being 95c short on a $21.95 guitar.

"Black Hearted Woman" fell flat; "Revival" went overlooked; "Ain't Wastin' Time No More" came close and "Blue Sky" came even closer. But at long last the Allman Brothers Band have broken through with their first major hit single in lead guitarist Richard Betts' "Ramblin' Man."

Recorded a year ago, "Ramblin' Man" and Gregg Allman's "Wasted Words" were the only two tracks completed for Brothers And Sisters before bassist Berry Oakley's death last fall. The two cuts, along with a studio jam called "Berry's Tune," originally were planned to comprise an entire side of the LP. Plans changed during the group's lengthy stay in the studio, and the jam eventually was scratched from the album. "We have the cut stored away," said producer Johnny Sandlin. "We still might release it someday. In the meantime, however, 'Ramblin' Man' stands as the last tune Berry recorded with the Brothers."

Richard (formerly Dicky) Betts is proud of the song. "I think my initial inspiration for it was the Hank Williams tune called 'When the Lord Made Me, He Made a Ramblin' Man.' That tune's always been my favorite of all the Hank Williams songs. His is a completely different kind of a tune, but the idea is the same between the two.

"I guess the song is more or less autobiographical. Not right down to the point, but overall it's a pretty true song. There's a lot of things I wish I could say in my songs that I can't. I suppose every writer's like that, but 'Ramblin' Man' is a tune I consider pretty successful for me.

"We also really got into utilizing the studio on that song. I never could get used to recording in the studio when we first started out. We'd always try our best to play in there just like we played onstage. Slowly, but surely, we've begun to realize that the two are completely different entities. I got into some over-dubbing on the end of 'Ramblin' Man' with another guitar player here in town Les Dudek. He's playing with B Scaggs now. Together, the two of us put on about eight guitar parts. It was a lot of fun."

"Ramblin' Man" follows loosely in the same fluid, C&W tradition of Betts' previous "Blue Sky," his first vocal performance with the Brothers. "I was very happy with that song too," he said. "It was originally recorded with Duane as a basic instrumental track. No vocal. I hadn't been doing any singing, so when we tried to put the vocal on it, we found it was in too low a key. It didn't really matter though, it came off good. It just sounded funny when I first heard myself singing on the radio.

"I'll tell you what was even funnier was when we watched ourselves on In Concert." The Allman Brothers Band's segment of the show, which ran last December, unveiled "Ramblin' Man" for the first time. "We looked so nervous. We looked scared . . . I guess that's because we were."
