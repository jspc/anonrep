"On my next album," declared Brian Eno as he batted a paddle ball around Circus/Raves World Headquarters, "I will follow my idea of using musicians who are not compatible with each other." It was a brainstorm the exotic Englishman began to pursue on his solo LP Here Come The Warm Jets. "The studio provides a unique opportunity to put together people who wouldn't in any other situation work together, who basically don't agree.

"You just couldn't do it onstage," the blond synthesizer-master continued, his blue eyes sparkling like diamonds. "Imagine trying to get Robert Fripp together with Simon King, the drummer of Hawkwind! The concept is ludicrous, neither would agree to it."

Eno: Dreams can be a way of seeing into the future, detailed the rouged studio master.



Eno: Naked and Neurotic

Twelve years of convent schooling with the Sisters of Mercy had not prepared the intrepid CREEM photog for her first plunge into the realm of hi-gloss soft porn snap shooting. Following the "hello-how-a'yas," Eno's publicist Simon Puxley hopefully queried, "Would you like to take some nude photos of Eno as test shots for Viva?

Not that Eno will drop his bottoms for everyone. But since Viva expressed a great desire to see him au naturel, flashed in fleshy colour gloss across their centrefold, Eno decided to comply. Being a leader in the avant garde (and in this case, garde derriere), after conceptual art, musique concrete and Roxy, there was no new world left for the irrepressible Eno to conquer save Beefcake.

Magazine history could not be denied Eno chic to cheek. "I could never do this for a male photographer - I'd be too embarrassed. Don't be coy, thousands have seen me naked."

As Ian Hunter says in Diary of a Rock and Roll Star, the human bod, undraped, by light of sun is a pretty mundane shell, downright grotty and un-erotic. There was something R. Crumbian comic in seeing Eno traipse the length and breadth of the room, wearing naught but a Registered Cult Figure tee shirt, his manhood flouncing jauntily in the breeze, wondering what poses he could effect that "aren't neurotic."

The session hit a crescendo of surrealistica as Eno began twisting like a pretzel, saying, straight-faced: "Get a bun shot." After suggesting that he be photographed spread-eagle "with all my rudeness showing," Simon reminded Eno, who seemed a trifle hurt, that Viva didn't care about his genitalia, just his supple Grecian bod. He ran the gamut of tease poses: Eno teething fetchingly on a sheet, Eno fingering a glass of white wine "decadently," Eno calling some girl on the phone whilst naked. After sprawling on his tummy, Eno was in a mild state of arousal. "Forgive me if I have a hard-on; it is certainly the way of nature. I can't sit up," he moaned.

"Yes, Viva doesn't like erections," Simon thoughtfully mulled, "but they're only test shots."

"I'll cover it with a book," which Eno did unil he was once again discreet.

How was he coming up to snuff? Would he make the grade and join Fabian and Lyle Waggoner and even, fer chrissakes, John Davidson? "I have lovely shoulders in rock and roll, and quite a nice face..." scanning down the expanse of his fleshoid buff. "I'm quite pleased with myself... except for my knees; I have knobbly knees. They won't reject me for my knees, will they? Yes, my knees and my FEET. I hate my feet; they're always cold. The only time my feet aren't cold is when I make love, which I do all the time. I only make love to keep my feet warm."

Unless Viva picks up on a good thing, all the Eno anyone will ever see, celuloid speaking, is the contact sheet under the photog's mattress. Eno'd like to keep it that way. He had an unpleasant run-in with a male groupie ("They're of even less use than female ones"), and threatened, with a crack of doom, "If these pictures ever find their way into any gay magazines" (mustering bile and bluster and pointing at the photog) "I'll break your glasses!" Eno's a man of his word, and you can never tell into whose hands CREEM will fall, can you?

One of the many preoccupations of contemporary art is the incestuous examination of its proceses. Through the dissection of form, content is eliminated. Via its negation, a new supra-content materializes: what you don’t see.

Art students agree, Marcel Duchamp did Everything. In a ten-year span during the world-in-upheaval of France 1915, Duchamp recognised the concept of The Concept. The process as a simplifying and reducing statement.

Duchamp freed the senses from the fascism of “artistic perception”. The eye sees what it expects to see, the two dimensional. Duchamp subliminally assaulted these pre-conceptions when he exhibited a shop-bought bottle-rack as a painting: the ready-made.

After Marcel came surrealism, dada, abstract expressionism, Pop, Op, found and anti-art.

Music: the 12 tone dissolution of Schoenberg, the 12 bar reductionism of the blues. John’s Cage and Cale, atonal terrornauts.

This is Brian Eno’s homeroom. A man without a song.

Two years ago Roxy Music became the darlings of the British pop scene. They were different – looked weird, sounded stranger. You all know about singer-stylist Bryan Ferry, a solid Paul, Andy and Phil, and the interchangeable bass player unit.

Brian Eno was the original synthesizereist for Roxy Music. Eno’s role was not the star-tripped soloist in your Emerson-Wakeman niche. Eno cannot play any instrument. He knows how to attack one though, and by twiddling dials on mixers and phasers, he texturized the tone of Roxy Music.

“I’m an anti-musician. I don’t think the craft of music is relevant to the art of music.”

The other Roxies were not musicians, either. The drums held a steady up-tempo; solos rebounded. Andy MacKay’s whooping-cough shenanigans on the saxophone and Eno’s exploding synthi-shudders stole too much of Ferry’s tuxedo spotlight. Eno left.

Roxy Music has found itself on the doorstep of American acceptance. The non-Eno Stranded and Ferry’s own solo discs are finding their way to the airwaves and hi-fis. But Brian Eno was instrumental (or non-instrumental, if you like) in getting Ferry and friends where they perch today.

Eno chatted on the phone from Hollywood about his halcyon Roxy daze.

“At the time I was in Roxy Music it was absolutely out of the question that the band would play any other than Bryan’s songs. That’s one of the reasons I left. He was completely against the idea. Bryan said, ‘Roxy Music is me and I refuse to sing anyone else’s songs!’ One of the problems he had with the band I can really understand was that he was the source behind it, having originated the idea of Roxy Music. Bust the spirit and style of Roxy Music was more than Bryan Ferry. He was the important element, but there was more to it than that. And when the press started picking up on the band their attention centred on me. I like to do interviews and I’m photogenic. So it happened that my picture was always being published. I can thoroughly well understand why Bryan was annoyed by that. From the point of view of an observer it looked as though Roxy Music was my band, and it wasn’t like that at all. And after the first American tour, Bryan decided to establish that it was his band.

“My position in Roxy Music was always half-way between the musical and the theoretical. I was never the sort of person who could sit down at the piano and hammer out a song, or says, ‘Here man, play this.’ I’m much more interested in talking about the ideas behind the music. Working things out from the aesthetic.

“The thing I really enjoyed about Roxy was the diversity of the band. The fact that there was always a tension between a lot of different musical ideas. I like to think I encouraged this tension. I always said that we shouldn’t have smoothed things out by saying it’s this kind of band or that. We must allow it to be a unit that the tension can move in any direction, which is sometimes rough on the edges but is generally interesting.

“Bryan and I fell out because he couldn’t agree with this. My experiment was in the way one makes music. His was in the quality of what the music said.”

Once outside of Roxy Music Eno was able to experiment as the avant garde popstar. He traced a direction somewhere between the lady-killer and the Serious Artists. Here Come The Warm Jets was recorded, released. A major tour of the town halls of middle-Britain was cancelled after a headlining incident.

“My lung collapsed. I went into the hospital and didn’t play any music for six weeks. During that time I was thinking, ‘Why should I tour?’ I don’t very much enjoy it. It’s not very creative. I’m more of a technologist, manipulating studios and musicians in a funny way. It sounds fantastic but one of the things that I tried to do with Warm Jets was to bring musicians together who would normally never play together and to play a music that they couldn’t agree upon. The music would come from the chemistry. But of course, it was impossible to do. I couldn’t expect any of the session people I worked with to go along with it. They literally fought.

“I’ve never really had any expectation for any albums to be hits. I do what I do regardless.”

With friend Robert Fripp, Eno recorded an LP No Pussyfooting. Fripp’s feedback guitar plays against a cadenza of Eno tapes. Electronic music is oft considered cold and empty but Pussyfooting is an emotional work, sad but whimsical.

“I had an eight foot cube room constructed for the album cover. The mood of the music, the reflections, echoes and mutations, is quite similar to the mood of the room. Fripp and I will be recording another LP very soon. It should be even more monotonous than the first one!”

Was Brian aware that a “pussyfoot” was a brand name of an American toilet manufacturer? Since “warm jet” refers to urination, was there, well, an unconscious connection?

“Really?? Uh… no, I didn’t know that. That’s a very nice connection. We certainly don’t have that kind of thing in England. Oh…”

Eno’s process of generating his words and music is a rather unusual one compared with traditional composers. Eno assembles sounds and impressions which gradually turn into a “song”. On Here Come The Warm Jets, he finds his random imagery in a spirit close to a sleep-walker.

“The structure of the songs is very simple. I’m not really interested in the possible complexities. I’m not really capable of doing it, so all their songs are in terms of their basic chord progressions. Sometimes they are simple and melodic like Cindy Tells Me. Others are simple but non-melodic like Driving Me Backwards. I regard song structure as a graph paper. It’s different than the ELP-Yes idea where you start with something very complex and rely on that to carry the musical substance of the material.

“My lyrics are generated by various peculiar processes. Very random and similar to automatic writing. But these concepts have lagged well behind my concepts of music making. In fact there’s only three or four tracks on the album whose lyrics I’m happy with. Blank Frank, Baby’s On Fire were successful.

“Dead Finks Don’t Talk is the most randomly generated of my songs. I wrote the lyrics at home with my girl-friend with a cassette of the backing track from the studio. I sang whatever came into my mind as the song played through. Frequently they’re just nonsense words or syllables. First I try for the correct phonetic sound rather than the verbal meaning. Off the top I was singing ‘oh-dee-dow-gubba-ring-ge-dow.’ So I recorded these rubbish words and then I turned them back into words. It’s the exact opposite of the technique used in phonetic poetry where words are changed into pure sounds. I take sounds and change them into words.

“Dead Finks is not about Bryan Ferry. After all the music was recorded and the words written, Chris Thomas (my producer and Roxy’s as well) said, ‘you’ll get me shot for that track. It’s obviously about Bryan.’ So I listened back to it and it obviously was. It was certainly something I hadn’t realised. Essentially all these songs have no meaning that I invested in them. Meanings can be generated within their own frame-work. It may be a very esoteric thing to talk about but I don’t think it’s entirely out of the question.”

Eno’s latest adventure finds him teamed with the Velvet viola, John Cale. Cale is currently finishing the follow-up to Paris 1919. As well, they have shepherded chantoosie Nico back into the studios. A live LP of the evening’s collaboration with fellow Island-mate Kevin Ayers has been released, June 1, 1974. Early rumours had it that Eno, with Cale and Nico, were to reform the Velvet Underground. That ain’t the whole story.

“We weren’t thinking of any big operation or a permanent band. We contacted Maureen Tucker and Sterling Morrison and hey were interested. But, we were only going to play three or four concerts. We were going to use John’s songs, Nico’s and my own. But it was over-exaggerated by the press. They said I was going to replace Lou Reed! We weren’t going to call it the Velvet Underground, and I didn’t want to go on stage to be judged as Lou Reed’s replacement. People would come along and expect me to sing Heroin…”

Undoubtedly, Eno will find something to so with his in-between time. He has the second Fripp LP to do, and a second singular attack to come to.

Till then, Brian, do you know the Eno Fruit Salt jingle?

“ Oh, of course:
‘E – N – O, ENO! 
When you’re feeling low – ENO!
It’s mild and gentle
And good, good tasting
Bubbly, bubbly, bubbly
ENO!’ ”

But is it art?

Sure, because you can dance to it.

Fripp Pussyfoots With Eno


From an unknown publication, probably in 1973, from the Jeffrey Morgan Archive.


“Anyone who really wants me knows where he can find me.” With a series of statements along these lines, Robert Fripp dismantled King Crimson and set out to prepare body and soul for the apocalypse which he believes to be around the corner. He is, in musical terms, “a guitar for hire” – of sorts. “I can’t make any staggering claims for being the saviour of the new age, leading the world into a new dawn with a golden guitar around my neck, the music of the spheres dropping from every digital movement,” Fripp quipped while he sipped Celestial Seasons tea (“you can really taste the vibes in it”).

“But if anyone really wants to hear me play in certain situations of my choosing, maybe that can be arranged,” the blue-eyed master added mischievously. That situation seems to be materializing into at least one major U.S. gig of the Fripp and Eno duo at New York’s Felt Forum later this spring.

The doll-like techno-rocker, Eno, and Fripp have created a vinyl disc, No Pussyfooting, together, a work of considerable value to the seeker after intense moments of sonic penetration. But onstage they are completely unexplored territory.

“A concert would consist of Fripp and Eno and no one else,” the alchemist of the six strings explained. “Possibly someone mixing. Tracks would be recorded at home with different tape loops and cassettes, but in a fashion where Eno could plug in any cassette or any system or series of cassettes that appeal to him at the moment. It must put me on the spot where, having prepared these tracks, I’ve never heard that particular combination before and have to react on the moment to what he’s done.” A kind of spontaneous combustion of man and technology.

“I’ve been thinking that systems of harmonic extensions, changes of keys could also be built in, which is quite different from one Revox to another, you build up one note which becomes linked automatically. He can discontinue that and in time it decays. Side One of Fripp and Eno is, in fact, only two guitars. It took me 45 minutes and cost $12. It just goes to show what you can achieve with a small unit.”

Only by way of “small, highly mobile intelligent units”, (unlike large rock bands), is society to survive the future, believes Fripp, who sees today’s civilisation as one dominated by dinosaur monoliths unbalancing the delicate structure of earth. “Man has an inflated sense of his own importance…. Being a rock star, for instance, is psychically dangerous… The huge rock’n roll entourage that goes on the road is, frankly, over… the music produced by groups will reflect the return over a period of years, to a simpler, more vital music. It will become hopefully, and I think inevitably, more concise and to the point. The end of the nonsense to which we’ve been treated by the likes of King Crimson!”

What if “Red”, the fiery last Crimson LP becomes a hit album and makes its founder wealthy? “Good. It will enable me to pursue more profitable activities longer,” replied Fripp, and he set out to sketch his blueprint for tomorrow, in which a very different consciousness must evolve.

Roxy Meets Dali, Climbs Out On Ledge

When Alice dallied with Salvador Dali, the world stood up and took notice. So England's super-svelte transsexual band Roxy Music decided that a day with Dali might help polish its already shimmering career. The group cruised up to the Hotel Meurice in Paris, took the elevator to Dali's apartment, rang the bell, and waited for an explosion of absurdity. They were sadly disappointed. The master of surrealism ushered them in, told them he'd invited a TV crew but that it had failed to show up, and offered them the consolation of a cup of tea. After half an hour of spirited silence, Roxy finally left for their own hotel. As if to make up for the anticlimax of the summit meeting with surrealism's master, at a party that night in a stately Parisian restaurant Roxy's friend and opening act Lloyd Watson got drunk, made several flamboyant speeches, threw a dozen butterknives at the wall, then climbed out a window with a wine glass in his hand, crawled along the ledge on the outside of the building, and crawled in through a window twenty feet away. Announced Lloyd to the flabbergasted waiters as they barred and shuttered every window in the room, "It's all a part of the act.”

Eno - Here Come The Warm Jets (Island)

Rating: one heart [Love it!]


Charter Member of both Roxy Music and Portsmouth Sinfonia, Eno has spent most of his free time working on this first solo excursion and the time was well spent. Dwelling in an eerie realm fluctuating somewhere between Fantasia and early Sixties British pop, Eno dabbles in a musical world untouched by human hands… so far, anyhow. The solid drumming lurks in the shadows, the synthesized melodies dart in and out of the vocal lines, the guitar work soars overhead and the vocals…? Well, they change from song to song: nasal twangs become effeminate whispers, high whines evolve into low, breathy commands. It’s as strange as all that… plus some. Well produced.

ENO: Eno is a throw off from Roxy Music. Along with Bryan Ferry, he was the other self-confessed nonmusician in the group who, after recording two albums with them, left by mutual consent. “One ‘nonmusician’ in the band is enough,” Bryan sniffed in comment when the split occurred.

But Eno didn’t just sit back and paint his nails! No sir!! He bounced back stronger than ever with a solo album titled Here Come The Warm Jets (Island) and is one of the most ingenious talents to come out of the closet, into the rock world. He abstains from performing live, preferring to spend all his time in the recording studio. He is a true artist and his medium is music, painting light-hearted surrealist jaunts. For minute tours of one comic book angle for life or another, scored with tunes that are simple but with production that is among the most inventive today. Sometimes, while listening to this album, it sounds as if he were almost trying to create life with the stereophonic concoctions that he mixes up.

This one man dynamo of new musical hysteria is a powerhouse in other fields as well. In Hollywood, California, in the dressing room of Whiskey A Go Go, the West Coast Mecca of trend setting rock, all the teeny pouting lovelies have been carrying a bit of news around about Eno that once and for all proves that all the young dudes aren’t where it’s at anymore.

Shortly after Mr. Eno hit town, those gorgeous little muffins who had here-to-fore known him as the “balding eunuch” of glam fascination would sooner or later, usually sooner, come into contact with his insatiable appetite and, from that day out, remember him as the "One Man Orgy”. When asked exactly why this was true, most of these glorious gammins would just roll their eyes and titter. Finally one teen age trend setter gave a Mae West roll of the hips and purred in reply, “If the shoe fits, honey, wear it…”


The enterprising and ever-esoteric Brian Eno doesn't depend entirely on theory to execute his exciting and unique "solo" albums. "I've developed a new system of writing lyrics," he confided to a British Journalist, regarding his new opus, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy). "One of which is panic. Practically all the lyrics were written in fifteen minutes, but they're based on suspicions which existed for some time."

Though he's quite taken with the possibilities and intricacies of electronic audio technology, Eno hasn't forgotten that spontaneity is rock's heart and soul. "The thing about writing fast," he admitted, "is that you don't guard yourself. Because the problem with writing lyrics is that one can become very self-conscious. The printed word can look very over-specific; that's why I don't have the lyrics printed on the sleeve."

Just as his omnisexually attractive appearance and voraciously notorious libido reveal Eno to be in the vanguard of avant-garde morality, his rock and roll is likewise radical. "It's always time to question what has become standard and established," he proposes. "I'd like to suggest greater freedom in the way people approach music." Eno's musicians on his third solo sortie into the musical unknown include once again Phil Manzanera, the brilliant and powerful guitarist who continues to act as a link between Eno and Roxy Music, which he helped to create. Other studio aces making contributions were Brian Torrington on bass (from the Winkies, Eno's touring band), and Fred Smith on drums.

The most enticing Eno news, however, reopens the possibility of the eccentric egocentric bringing his madness to the concert stage. Although he had previously regarded live performance a secondary consideration, the recent availability of King Crimson founder Robert Fripp may have changed Eno's changeable mind.


ENO: Another Green World (Island) – Then there are those who WANT to be neglected.

Last year Brian Eno’s “Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy” established him as a bona fide cult favourite without in the least disturbing the buying patterns of the American consumer.

Sioux City, Iowa Journal, 1977, reviewing 1976’s neglected albums.



Earlier this year it was announced in the MM [Melody Maker] that Polydor were planning to release new albums by Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno, but since then nothing has been heard of these projects. What has happened?
Brian's involvement on the exceptional, but controversial new Bowie album, "Low," has been well documented, and my special choice is the track "Warzsawa," with music by Brian. But I'm wondering about the collaboration, on this track especially. It is said that Brian wrote and performed all the music and Bowie then added all the vocals, but did either of them realise exactly how it would eventually sound, having written it in this way?
Is Brian's soundtrack to the remarkable Derek Jarman film Sebastiane available?
Brian was rather enthusiastic about his own "Discreet Music" and I believe it was released on his Obscure label, but it is proving almost impossible to track down. Can you give any information on his other productions for Obscure?
In the MM 8 Days A Week feature Brian said he would be leaving Britain for "the hopefully more stimulating atmosphere of Amsterdam." Does he intend to carry out this threat?
Geraldine Schenk de Regniers, Edgware, Middlesex.

"The Manzanera and Eno albums will he released in September. The album "Low" evolved without a precise final condition in mind. I shall at some stage be compiling an album of film music which will include some of the Sebastiane pieces, with other film and TV work I've done. Polydor are due to release all seven Obscure albums which have previously been released, plus four new ones, including one by myself. The threat to leave for Amsterdam has abated due to unforeseen circumstances - England seems to be waking up again after its long winter. God bless the new wave: they are preparing the soil for something truly interesting to happen. As far as I’m concerned, the fact that the business is utterly bewildered by them is refreshing."

BRIAN ENO.


BEFORE AND AFTER SCIENCE – Brian Eno – Island ILPS 9478 – Producers: Brian Eno and Rhett Davies – List: 7.98

This is one of the most important techno-rock albums yet produced. Previously available only as an import, the LP has finally been released in the U.S. While the music is similar to Bowie’s recent efforts in many respects, Eno is more melodic and closer to standard musical styles. Many of the cuts take more than one listen to appreciate – but they stand up to close inspection. “Here He Comes,” among others, might even have pop potential.

Everything you'd rather not have known about Brian Eno

It was with a certain apprehensive curiosity that I first noticed the brown lace-up shoes. He displayed a normalcy that I just couldn't trust. After all, I'd seen his photos and I knew I was dealing with no ordinary deviant.

Yet the toned-down reserve, the limp handshake (handshake?) and the nice-guy inoffensiveness had me baffled. He just didn't come on like someone who keeps an extensive collection of breast bondage literature in the bathroom.

I mean, what do you say to this guy? "Oh hi Eno .... Hear you shaved off your pubic hair?" He answers the door wearing a red satin kimono and black dress pants. We pass through the dimly-lit hallway to a large white room which consists entirely of a lit candle, two pillows, tape recorder and beige carpet.

"Carpeting gives you a whole new outlook on life, you don't need furniture."

Eno's voice has absolutely nothing in common with the vocal tracks on Here Come The Warm Jets, his forthcoming L.P.

His pronunciation is that of a soft-spoken gentleman. His singing is not unlike the shriek of a hare that's just caught an air gun pellet up the ass.

Given only the minutest amount of prompting, he will talk non-stop for hours. In this case, the mere mention of his vocal techniques sets him off.

"VOCAL TECHNIQUES. That's something I've never even thought about. Why, I propose the question to myself do people sing certain ways at certain times in history? Why should I want to sing through my nose?" (He breaks into 'Baby's On Fire', a track from H.C.T.W.J. and, as if it's her cue, a 6 ft. 2 in. 195 lb. negress enters the room, lights his cigarette, and without saying a word, exits.)

-- "What I like is when you get a combination of something that's very turned-down and dark and sinister, but not dramatic - very underhand and almost inaudible, as opposed to the kind of aggression that people like the Floyd use, which is very obvious assault. Iggy Pop does it as well.

"I like taking something that's played down -low-key - contrasting with a voice that's very anguished, making the whole sound grotesque and aggressive in a pathetic and laughable way. 'Baby's On Fire' starts out as though it's going to be very sinister, but has very ordinary words, sung with an incredible amount of passion."

What about the song which incorporated 27 pianos? - the one that was inspired by a dream . . .

"You mean 'On Some Faraway Beach'. It wasn't only inspired - all the words to that occurred in the dream. I quite often wake up and write down my dreams because I find them so completely mysterious. I can't see what it was in me that made me put together that particular combination of items.

"I find the dreams are always much more brilliant in their construction than anything I consciously think of. On that particular one, I just woke up with all these words in my head and I wrote them straight down in the dark. When writing from dreams, you don't feel any responsibility for what you do, which is important to me. Another way I write lyrics is to get the backing track down and then play it with a cassette near by and, as it's playing, I start singing anything to it - like 'ba-do-de-be-de-n- do-day'. And I do that a lot until I finally end up with a version in scat singing. Then I listen to that again and again until eventually I don't hear it as nonsense anymore and I start hearing words. Then I write them out and they become the words to the song. I find it absolutely impossible to sit down without music and write lyrics because basically I haven't got anything to say in a direct way like that. The actual musical context of a song is always so much more expressive than the words are. Lyrics in songs, in nearly 80% of cases, actually make the song less interesting. The lyrics I like best are the ones which are either completely bland like the early rock lyrics, where there's obviously no attempt to do anything but to sing a melody - or, on the other hand, I admire the ones of the great librettists like Noel Coward. And also Bryan . . ."

"Ferry?"

"Yeah, I think Bryan's an extraordinary lyric writer, but in a style that I could never do. That kind of verbal imagery doesn't really come from me very much. I have no pretensions to poetry at all.

"The deciding factor about what words I use is what vowels they have in them - what their phonetic structure is. "If it said: 'Baby goes sloooo-ly', it wouldn't have the same aggression rating, and that's the basis I choose words on. It could have been baby's on anything - 'Baby's on hire' (ha ha ha). which is an interesting variation.

"Fuck! I wish I'd thought of that! I should have done this interview before I did the album!

"I'M ALWAYS PRONE to do things very quickly, which has distinct advantages - you leave all the mistakes in, and the mistakes always become interesting. The Velvet Underground, for example, are the epitome of mistake-filled music, and it makes the music very subtle and beautiful.

"Any feature can be the most important one - as long as there is one important feature. There are so many bands who present you with a large number of well-done features - none of which are important.

"I think that bands like Yes and E.L.P., even The Floyd who everyone's saying are the beginning of something new and exciting - the new rock tradition - are just tying up a lot of loose ends.

"They're finishing something off which is a useful function, but not one which should be confused with breaking new territory."

His voice trails off as he spies a copy of Search magazine. He leafs through it with obvious pleasure, but the gleam in his eyes softens, and sadly he shakes his head, "It's a burning shame that most people want to keep pornography under cover when it's such a highly developed art form - which is one of the reasons that I started collecting pornographic playing cards I've got about 50 packs which feature on all my record covers for the astute observer.

"There's something about pornography which has a similarity to rock music. A pornographic photographer aims his camera absolutely directly, at the centre of sexual attention. He's not interested in the environment of the room.

"I hate the sort of photography in Penthouse and Playboy which is such a compromise between something to give you a hard-on and something which pretends to be artistic. The straight pornographers aim right there where it's at.

"Which is analogous to so many other situations where somebody thinks one thing is important, so they focus completely on that and don't realize they're unconsciously organizing everything else around it as well. I have such beautiful pornography - I'll show you my collection sometime.

The last guy invited me up to see his etchings.

"One theory is that black-and-white photography is always more sexy than colour photography. The reason for this is provided by Marshall McLuhan, who points out that if a thing is 'high definition,' which colour photography is, it provides more information and doesn't require participation as much as if it is 'low definition'." I.e. a horror play on the radio is always very, very frightening because the imagery is always your own. If youUre choosing your own imagery, you'll always choose the most frightening, or in the case of pornography, the most sexual.

"The idea of things being low definition has always interested me a lot - of being unspecific - another thing which is a key-point of my lyrics. They must be 'low definition' so that they don't say anything at all direct. I think the masters of that were Lou Reed and Bob Dylan (on "Blonde on BIonde"). The lyrics are so inviting.

"DO YOU KNOW WHAT 'burning shame' is by the way? It's a pornographic term for a deviation involving candles.

"Ouch!"

"Very popular in Japanese pornography. They're always using lit candles because Japanese pornography is very sadistic, partly because of the Japanese view of women, which is a mixture of resentment and pure animal lust.

"In the traditional view, a woman is still expected to be at the beck and call of her husband, so that manifests itself in that kind of pornography. Of which I have a few examples, of course.

"Mexican pornography is an interesting island of thought because they seem to be heavily into excretory functions. The traditional American view is that anything issued from the body is dirty. It's incredibly puritanical and it resents bodily fluids, so if one is trying to debase a woman, you cover them with that and hence you get the fabulous term 'Golden Showers' - the term for pissing on someone, which some well- known rock musicians are said to be very involved in . .

"Here come the warm jets?"

"That's certainly a reference."

That he's considered to be a film star of sorts in a few very 'elite' circles. - Any chance of him making a comeback to the Screen?

"Some of the movies I did were very funny - they had to pretend to have a plot. Ha ha.

"Can I show you my pubic area?" (! ! !) He exposes his stomach down to his, ah - about six inches below his Navel. "Absolutely bare! Now I've got this beautiful bare belly! I've got this new Japanese thing, you see and the Japanese don't have much hair on their bodies 'Japanese culture I tip as the next big thing."

I glance nervously over at the flickering candle on the windowsill. Out of nowhere, Eno produces a very extraordinary looking object which he explains to be the 'Double Punkt Roller', a massage device used in Victorian times. I marvel at its aesthetic qualities and he assures me that it can only be fully appreciated when used on the bare buttocks. We conclude that art which demands participation holds the greatest appeal.

"I think that until the turn of the century, art was always the object - the thing on the wall - whereas now, the orientation is more to think that art is the process, or what happens to you when you view it. "I think this is an important part of Gary Glitter's records in that they make you move in a funny sort of way. Or reggae. It's not possible to assess them without taking into account the part of their existence which causes a certain kind of behaviour.

"I've always been interested in the idea of what I call systems art/systems music', which is where you think first of all of your activity as a system which must be intact and interesting - and you think of the artwork which also must be interesting - and you think of the listener as a system which must be interesting too. So you must work on all these levels. "That's why I don't like the idea of spending months and years recording, because essentially, that isn't an interesting process to me."

AT THIS POINT, a leather-clad redhead, her fingers covered with glue and green parakeet feathers enters the room and announces the arrival of 'the carpenter'. At 1.00 a.m. the inhabitants of the house appear to be waking up, and what all the excitement is about I'm rather reluctant to discover. Gentleman that he is, Von Eno sees me to the door, and, gazing down the night-time street: "Did you know there's a girls' school with 400 girls just round the corner? Very nice, I'll tell you, it really is lovely. I mean they're so beautiful those little girls are. My conscience won't let me tamper - feel I might damage their lives if I do anything."

 [Eno icon] Back to silence, back to nothing


Here Come the Warm Jets

Brian Eno

An excerpt from Creem, October 1974, by Lester Bangs

...shooting the new mania through your lobes and out your kicking sinews and pounding fists. You can throw all that other crap out -- Dylan, Bowie, Clapton -- it may be nice in its place but Roxy Music is the only music that says anything new or reflects the spirit of '74 with any accurate passion. If you still haven't bought Stranded GO GET THE GODDAM THING and wolf it down, it'll only leave you hungry for more. Which fortunately is in ample supply: Bryan Ferry has already made two solo albums, having just released the first, brilliant one (These Foolish Things) in the U.S.; Roxy saxman Andy McKay has an album coming out; and Eno, brilliant keyboard experimentalist who contributed much to the Velvet Underground pulsating pungency of the first two Roxy albums before his split from the group, is all around us on two worthwhile jam imports (one with King Crimson's Robert Fripp which -- be forewarned -- is monochromatic unto absolute stillness but mesmerizing thereby, and one with Kevin Ayers and ex-Velvets Nico and John Cale), as well as this incredible record which joins Stranded in proving with absolute finality that Roxy and Eno parted are merely twin peaks.

I've had Here Come the Warm Jets in import copy since early spring, and the best of it still stuns and fries me every time I slap it on. Side two does tend to meander a bit, but side one has one of the most perfect lineups in years, solid and throbbing primitivo all the way but with the strangest increment of avant-girdings, like a cross between Nico's Marble Index and Slade. Don't worry, Eno may like synthesizer but this isn't one of those doodley-squats like George Harrison's Electronic Sounds -- these are hard-driving, full-out rock'n'roll songs with consistent percussive force, slashingly economical guitar solos by Fripp and Roxy's Phil Manzanera (who is the most exciting new guitarist since James Williamson, whom he technically far surpasses), and the consistent acidulous edge of Eno's vocals.

Which is where the real twisto action comes in. This guy is a real sickie, bubs, sick as Alice Cooper once was sposed to be, sicker by far than David Bowie's most scabrous dreams. What will you make, for instance, of a song which begins with diabolical electronic telegraphy and the lyrics "Baby's on fire/Better throw her in the water/Look at her laughing/Like a heifer to the slaughter/Baby's on fire/And all the laughing boys are itching..." Don't tell me about the sleaze in your Silverhead -- Eno is the real bizarro warp factor for 1974. It's like he says in "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch": "By this time I got to looking for some kind of substitute/I can't tell you what kind, but you know that it rhymes with dissolute..." Meanwhile, the drums are pounding and the guitars are screaming every whichaway in a precisely orchestrated cauldron of terminal hysteria muchly influenced by though far more technologically advanced than early Velvet Underground. Don't miss it; it'll drive you crazy.

Eno: organizer of musical events


From an unknown publication, probably in 1974, by Lisa Robinson. From the Jeffrey Morgan Archive.




Eno - full name Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno - calls himself a non-musician. Yet, he's sitting in his Drake Hotel suite playing a lineup of glasses filled with liquids of varying degrees. It's music, all right, as is the music he's made with Roxy, and then more recently - his own solo lp (Here Come The Warm Jets) and his concerts with John Cale, Nico and Kevin Ayers in England. Before Eno left Roxy - a subject he says he no longer wishes to discuss because he finds it tedious but will under duress - he “treated" the instruments through synthesizers. First standing at the back of the hall, and then very much onstage, Eno was a visually important part of the group as well as musically. When it became obvious that there really could be no Star in Roxy except for Bryan Ferry, Eno left. He is quite happy with his present situation.

“I consider myself an organizer of musical events,” he says, in between eating a sandwich, playing the glasses, experimenting with, err, various forms of dadaist art, and fiddling about with a toy ukelele. "Once, at the very beginning of Roxy, it was possible to do that, it was exciting, and it was one of the most interesting experimental situations that could have existed. Just the idea that we didn't really want to have a focus onstage, it could have been Andy or me or Bryan. That was before we ever came to the States.

“And for a time there really was a triple ambiguity. But - apparently Bryan didn't want it that way and he conned us, really. I left because I had no other choice. Bryan said he was never going onstage with me again. We didn't disagree musically, and we never have, really. Anyway, he thought that I was trying to take over as leader in the band - mainly because I started getting a lot of press, and he thought I had done this whole operation behind his back.

"I was never interested in any of that and it's obvious that that wasn't my role in the band. The thing that fascinated me about Roxy was that there was this interplay of musicians and it was all up front even if it didn't seem that way. Potentially there was the possibility of anybody being a star for fifteen minutes - it wasn't the traditional kind of thing. We didn't want the traditional concept of anybody up front with a spotlight and the rest all with long hair standing around in the back."

Anyway, enough about Roxy. Eno - since leaving that band last year, has become involved in some of the important musical events of this past season. June 1 1974 was a concert organized by Island Records' Richard Williams - Kevin Ayers asked Nico, John Cale and Eno to join him on that day at the Rainbow. "We decided what the format of the concert would be and then the role sort of fell on me to be the keeper of the thing.

"I generally kept it from straying off the subject - which was that somebody would come onstage, and then go off again and then somebody else would have to come on, just the mechanics of what would we do in between the two people. Just making sure that we thought about those details of the actual stage problems and the whole layout of the set. So in fact the rehearsals were the most efficient rehearsals I've ever been involved in and we only rehearsed for about 20 or 25 hours at the most - which isn't a lot."

The result was the Island record titled June 1, 1974 - although not all of the numbers that they did were included. (Nico also sang 'Deutschland Uber Alles' and "Janitor of Lunacy'” and John did some from his forthcoming lp …)

“Apart from The Who, the Velvet Underground were my first rock heroes,” Eno commented, "so working with John and Nico (who had both been original members, Ed.) was really the fulfillment of a dream. The Who had come out in England with this expression of frenzy and madness that was unprecedented at that time - nobody was doing that.

"I had never seen the Velvets, but I had worn out all the records, and I tremendously admired John and Nico and Lou Reed for their separate contributions to the group. Working with them was of course interesting; both of them are very demanding people in a way - and so am I in another way. It was a very volatile situation and those are the ones that interest me in music. We weren't sitting around patting each other on the back saying 'groovy', 'let's blow together' - it was quite intense."

The concert crystalized an idea that had been happening for Eno, which was that a band didn't have to have a fixed personnel, the concept that there is enough dialogue between a certain group of musicians that at any time any number of them can get together and do some work. 'I've been thinking that this is the way to do things for a long time," he said, “I'm getting away from the idea of having a fixed group that stays together all the time."

“Just the idea that there can be a getting together particular situations of musicians who otherwise would not be able to come together. Of course we really couldn't take it on the road, because we'd fight after a few gigs,” Eno smiled. "Also because we're all basically into doing things on our own. And nobody in that set of people is prepared to commit themselves to be part of just one unit.”

“I'm not interested anymore in the idea of a front man and background musicians. The nice thing about that concert was that it wasn't a fixed focus, everyone there had their time and everyone was equally important. And this didn't only extend to the star names on the record, Robert Wyatt was involved and he was very important to the concept. All the other people on stage - there was no feeling of some people doing the interesting things and the others doing the hard work. It wasn't like that. Of course, those situations are so much easier to construct if you are only interested in doing it once or twice. You can afford to do it, you can afford to spend the money. And you can afford to forget your ego a little while to do it. And take into account that all the people on that stage are very egotistical, really. I don't mean they're necessarily trying to be stars - but they are people who make a strong musical statement of some kind or another."

Summing the experience up, Eno said, "First of all, it was a great concert, the best concert I've ever played - easily. I've never enjoyed anything so much. And secondly it produced an album which I really love and thirdly it proved a point which I thought was possible and which had never been proven in England successfully before - and that was the idea of the superstar get together. It's been such a disaster because what happens usually is that you get the lowest common denominator of every person. You don't bring out the best points in them, you bring out the points where they all agree, which is way down here."

Eno has been involved in a variety of albums this past year - his own solo, the June 1 concert, John Cale's forthcoming lp on which he is listed as executive producer, the Portsmouth Symphonia of which he is a member, a bizarre recording that he made with Robert Fripp ... and he feels that he wants to keep that rate of output and diversity of output because they're all very different from each other. "I was involved in all of that to the extent that they took a large amount of time to do, I didn't just walk into the studio and walk out again. It wasn't like doing sessions, but it was being quite heavily involved in it. Now I want to continue to do that, and if I start touring, I'll have to sacrifice those things and it isn't possible for me to do all those albums and go on tour. It's out of the question."

"I don't like touring much because I think for me it's not a very productive situation. I would like to do special concerts with special people, but you can't make those things happen too often, really."

In terms of Eno's own music - he says that his "technology" isn't developing very much. "But if you notice the difference between the "Baby’s on Fire” cut on my solo album and on the June 1st album there is a big difference. First of all, on the June 1st one there is an 8 part instrumental thing happening. All the instruments are playing very simple parts, there aren't any solo displays, or anything like that," Eno points out. "It's working with a combination of simple parts that change at different times. It's to do with overlaying very simple parts on simple structures but watching the progress of the parts in relation to each other and organizing them so that they change or so that each part changes into another simple part at a given time. But that another musician will be changing his at another time. So there's always this mesh and interplay of things changing and happening but there is never any complex movement on the part of any of the musicians. There is never any improvisation for example. I'm anti-improvisation and into note for note organizing. But, I mean the 'Baby’s on Fire' cut on the June 1st lp sounds crazy but that comes from being incredibly disciplined. Not from everyone getting on stage and playing anything."

When I mention that I particularly like his singing, Eno smiled and said, "I've always enjoyed singing and that's the first thing I can do because it's the only musical response that I can control in any way. But Bryan wasn't into letting anyone else sing lead in Roxy - so, that was another thing - no lead singers."

As to his work on John Cale's lp, Eno was listed as executive producer along with Roxy's Phil Manzanera, but he played on it as well. "I play much less than Phil because that wasn't the role I was fulfilling anyway. And generally, I was a kind of consultant or advisor, anyway. John was using me to bounce ideas off of, and get reactions from. It was a very intense month, it took a month to do and it was a month of solid work. I considered myself totally committed to that album at that time; John would ring me up at half past five in the morning and say 'I've just had this idea for such and such, what do you think?', and we would talk for one half hour. And I considered it part of my role to do that because that was really my only role at the time. I wasn't sort of putting hot licks on the album. And it was interesting - being this sort of consultant, ideas consultancy. It was very pleasant and the album is tremendous; I think it's the best John Cale album really - it has a whole other direction on it that he hasn't touched before. And it gave birth to the possibility of the June 1st concert."

Brian and his party trick. "Do not hit me -- I have glasses."

Eno and the Jets: Controlled Chaos

By Cynthia Dagnal


From Rolling Stone, September 12 1974, from the Jeffrey Morgan Archive


CHICAGO - The legend of ex-Roxy synthesizer player Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno is, we were told, as formidable as the name. It preceded him in press releases from England which proclaimed him "this surrealist rock superstar," a "sylph-like electronics guru," and "a cadaver we've all come to love and recognize . . . the scaramouche of the synthesizer." His sexual exploits, we were also told, would apparently make both Don Juan and de Sade seem grossly overrated, and promotion women called ahead with breathless descriptions of his magnetism and his "intellect." He was purportedly beautiful hermaphroditic, sensual and seductive. "The man that groupies of three continents have come to know as The Refreshing Experience" was coming to devastate our town with his presence and we were never to be the same again.

His new solo album, Here Come the Warm Jets, also preceded him into town - a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success. Until then there had been only descriptions of his music, promo-supplied outbursts like "inspired mayhem."

And there was the well-documented European success of Roxy Music, Bryan Ferry's moviola vision of rock oldies that jumped the British charts and captured the continent's imagination, so they say. The group failed to move anything on an introductory U.S. tour last fall - a promotional failure, Eno says: "They had us opening shows for Savoy Brown and Steve Miller, straight boogie bands, and it just didn't work" - and by the time Ferry was ready with a solo album this summer, Roxy was Eno-less too. "I was easily the most photogenic person in Roxy," Eno says. "I don't say that I was therefore the most attractive, but if they ever wanted to print an article about Roxy, they'd always have a photograph of me. My face became very well known, and people always think you must be the leader of the band, which is what Bryan got so uptight about."

Eno also turned his preoccupation with knobs and switches onto production, working with the Pan-Am Steel Band, the itinerant troubadour Magic Michael, and the Portsmouth Sinfonia (described by Eno's publicists as "an orchestra of non-musicians who give public performances of popular items from the classical repertoire and with whom Eno plays clarinet"). And he began trading studio credits and a couple of appearances with ex-Velvet Underground members John Cale and Nico, and with Kevin Avers, who has an underground of his own.

But the description that convinced at least this reporter that Eno might indeed be something unique was supplied by Chrissie Hynd of The New Musical Express: "His singing is not unlike the shriek of a hare that's just caught an air pellet up the ass." This I had to hear.

However, arriving in Chicago during a relentless heat and humidity spell, The Refreshing Experience was reduced to a somewhat limp and miserable little stringbean. He was pallid, what there is left of his thinning hair clinging to his neck: and a half-hearted smudge of rouge on either cheek only made his pallor more alarming. Any emotions on my part at that time would have to be classified as strictly maternal. He was hot, flu-stricken and angry with himself, almost seriously toying with the idea of locking himself in the fridge for relief. Eno does not tolerate "thickness," and the very fact that he could not concentrate made his already unstable temperature skyrocket.

"Usually my focus is very sharp. I did an interview in L.A. which was very good. It lasted for nine and a half hours and it got to where he was just saying a word like 'indeterminacy' and I'd just talk. I mean I'm quite used to talking. I lecture a lot in England. I lecture in fine arts at the art schools in England. . . . But I just feel so . . .” He crumpled over rather like a neglected Raggedy Andy.

His health had been described as chronically perilous in all of the articles supplied. One physical breakdown had reportedly occurred after some 30 hours of sexual activities involving no fewer than six women. It seemed, therefore, that he should be quite accustomed to performing in mid-collapse. He agreed. "My health has always been bad. But you see, usually it doesn't affect my brain. In fact usually I find it quite stimulating. When I'm really physically inoperative I think very fast. I’ll give you an example. Yesterday I was in San Francisco and I was working on this new project which is a piece of music called 'Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy.' It's a revoluionary/military battle seen as a form of contemporary dance. And I was really getting along very well with it, thinking very clean. And as soon as I got here I picked up my notebook and I thought, Great! I'll get back to 'Tiger Mountain!' But I started looking at my notes and I said," he continued, running a hand through his receding hair," 'What does this mean?' I realized that my IQ has dropped 60 points since I've been here in Chicago! I tell you ... God! I so much want to get out of this town. I mean we got off this lovely air-conditioned plane and into a car and I rolled down the window and this great rush of humidity came in. I thought there was a vapor leakage or something. I could not imagine that this was a condition people actually live in!"

After this outburst a tape recorder failure developed, and perhaps this opportunity to get back to his forte, electronics, temporarily sharpened his concentration. Asked to explain his description of himself as a "non-musician," Eno proved himself worthy of at least half of his reputation. Shifting languidly but with a strange feline grace from one supine position to another on the velvet sofa, the man gave out with ideas, sketches. Stockhausen-like music plans. Completely unaccustomed to this artist/intellectual approach, I settled back and let The Refreshing Experience wash over me almost without interruption.

"I can't play any instruments in any technically viable sense at all. And it's one of my strengths, I think, actually. Simply because I believe technique is as much a barrier as a way of opening something up. . . . I was teaching before I got into rock music, actually. I went from art into avant-garde music. The concepts that were happening in the fine arts and aesthetics in the late Sixties in England were very, very close to the kinds of ideas people were dealing with in avant-garde music, so English art schools became the important centers for avant-garde music. There was nowhere else to develop, English music colleges are hopelessly academic. So the avant-garde composers, a great number of them, got jobs in art schools. I was in an art school [Winchester College of Art] which was particularly good for this, and at the time I found music more immediate and less cumbersome for certain ideas, like systems and processes in time, than painting. So I went into music gradually.

"When I left college I did some teaching and I became more and more interested in trying to evolve some of these ideas into rock music. Avant-garde music is fiercely intellectual, fiercely antiphysical. Whereas rock is fiercely physical and fiercely anti-intellectual. I wanted to try to find a meeting of the two which would actually not be frightened of either force. Rock musicians are frightened of any kind of discussion of what they do. But I mean I deal with these kinds of ideas and that's my forte, so I don't intend not to do it.

"I do think that rock music is the most important art form right now. And that's corroborated by the amount of attention it gets. It wouldn't get that kind of attention unless it were important."

He shifted again and handed over a notebook full of plans for lectures and projects. They were unique to say the least - and the least, at this point, was all I intended to offer. Operating at a tenth of his normal capacities Eno had already proved himself undeniably ahead of his competition. His studio strategies were further proof.

"One of the things I do on the albums is assemble groups of musicians because they're incompatible and not because they're compatible. I'm only interested in working, really, with people I don't agree with or who have a different direction. Particularly on Here Come the Warm Jets - I assembled musicians who normally wouldn't work together in any real-life situation. And I got them together merely because I wanted to see what happens when you combine different identities like that and you allow them to compete. My role is to coordinate them, synthesize them, furnish the central issue which they all will revolve around, producing a hybrid.

"It's very dangerous at times. It almost sometimes goes over the edge into chaos and I'm not interested in that. Well, I'm interested in chaotic situations if I've established the parameters for the chaos sufficiently. But I'm not interested in loose situations. But it is organized with the knowledge that there might well be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting than what I intended."

Jumping up suddenly, to his own surprise, he rummaged through a nest of papers and found a colorful packet of Maoist postcards titled "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." The sight of it started him off again. "I nearly always work from ideas rather than sounds, Titles. It's that title that just fascinates me. It's fabulous. I mean, I'm interested in strategy, the idea of it. I'm not Maoist or any of that: if anything I’m anti-Maoist. Strategy interests me because it deals with the interaction of systems, which is what my interest in music is really, and not so much the interaction of sounds.

"One of the recurrent themes of rock music is a preoccupation with new dances. And it's taken by intellectuals as the lowest form of rock music, the most base and crude. So I was interested in combining that very naïve and crude form of basic expression with an extremely complex concept like 'Tiger Mountain.' Which would be sort of like a double joke. First of all the joke of me doing a dance number and secondly the fact that it also has a complete symbology that discusses another question . . . These notes look so interesting! And I know that as soon as I get out of this fucking city...

Although he repeatedly insisted that the city had him totally befuddled, he went on with a barrage of philosophies and ideas which suggest that Eno unbefuddled might be more than the average mind can stand.

"The idea is paraphrasing the dance as a dance between two technologies. One of McLuhan's contentions is that conflict, international conflict, is always conflict between two technologies, not two moralities. Moralities are dictated by those technologies. I've taken the conflict between the regular-type soldiers and guerrilla-type activities. I've called the regular-soldier-type ones, since they're mechanically oriented, clockwork ones. The guerilla-tactic ones are electronic." And he quoted from his notes:

The soldier seeks, the sniper waits,
The soldier is directed, clockwork, continuous.
The guerrilla is pervasive, environmental . . .

"I'm not subscribing to any political point of view. It's to do with this technological rift. Technological rifts have always produced hybrid art forms. I mean the reason that England is such an interesting place artistically is because it's an incredibly diverse place with opportunities for several kinds of rifts. There's an electronical society, a mechanical society and a rural society."

Somehow it didn't make sense that this man should be on a tour, following absurd promotional brouhaha from town to town. I wondered what had convinced him: a vision of universal acceptance? "I'm not an evangelist. It's a personal investigation. I would be doing this regardless. The good fortune of making it in rock music is that you have enough money to continue to experiment and to do what you want. And of course there's the immediacy."

For Eno the important thing is getting it out. He has two million feet of tape that hasn’t become music yet in his eyes because it is still at home on shelves.

Just about then the sparkle was fading again. Eno began to ramble to no avail. The flu was closing in, he was afraid he might have been prescribed something dreadful that was affecting his brain and it was killing him to feel so sluggish. He rang up the house doctor, only to find that he would have to go to the office, which meant of course going out into the steaming. Exhaust-fumed streets of downtown Chicago. And another reporter had arrived.

Eno's publicist, Simon Puxley, suggested that the reporter accompany Eno to the doctor's office and do the interview in the cab - a reasonable arrangement, so Simon thought.

"Of course it seems reasonable to you!" Eno snapped. "You don't have to fucking do it!"

I had been thinking that very thing. He had gotten to me after all.


Eno & Co: ACNE

LONDON -The acronym that an inspired British fan suggested for Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Nico and Eno as they wended in and out of each others' acts earlier this year is the description your mother was reaching for all this time when she thought of rock & roll: ACNE.

The four were between projects Eno just divorced from Roxy Music, Cale and Nico further each day from the Velvet Underground and their last brush with fortune, and Ayers nine-and-a-half years into a career that so far peaked five years ago as bassist with the original Soft Machine. All, quite coincidentally, were contracted to Island Records.

The label put them together at the Rainbow Theatre in June, basically tohelp out Ayers, and got a live recording from it and the kind of audience response that prompted a couple more shows in the backwaters - Manchester and Birmingham - and an announced free concert in London's Hyde Park, the first in three years.

Eno was ill though; Cale decided not to perform; and only Nico and Ayers eventually played. Later, Eno was to say of ACNE, "It was only a passing thing, I can't see anything permanent coming out of it."

Eno had his solo projects, an album, No Pussyfooting, with King Crimson's Robert Fripp and studio work to turn to, figuring to work with Cale and Ayers along the line.

Cale, now married to Cindy (formerly Miss Cinderella of the GTOs) and freshly back in London from a nomadic career as arranger, producer, singer/ songwriter, quadrasonics expert and, finally, A&R man for Wamer Bros. in Los Angeles, has his first Island release ready for Septernber. And he has recorded "Heartbreak Hotel," a knockout at the ACNE concerts - as a single aiming for a British chart hit. "Top of the Pops I love," he said. "I don't care. I've got confidence."

Nico, rescued from wandering the south of France by Cale, who brought her to Island, has been in the studio with Cale handling production.

Ayers, riding a three-year contract (that so far has netted Island two singles and an album, The Confessions of Doctor Dream, that cost more than £32,000 to produce), plans another album and a tour "Septemberish" with his backup band, the Soporifics.

ENO: On Top of Tiger Mountain

Approach to lyric-writing
How Eno viewed his role in 1974


When rock makes its next move and edges out of its current general state of confusion, the impetus which charges that move is unlikely to derive from a single source of energy. What is becoming evident, however, is a sense of shared responsibility, and the emergence of a group of individuals whose intelligence and background separates them from the main body of rock. One hesitates to impose upon them a collective identity, but check out the credits on your copy of June 1st for further details. there's already some evidence in two of this year's most rewarding albums - Fear and Rock Bottom - to suggest that the new direction, as yet undefined, will come from this direction. And if initial impressions are enough on which to build an opinion, those two albums are about to be joined by a third, Taking Tiger Mountain (by strategy). Which brings us, by a rather long route, to Brian Eno.

Tiger Mountain is Eno's third album since the celebrated split from Roxy, and in the context of this argument it might well prove as important a contribution as either John Cale's or Robert Wyatt's. The hesitancy of Warm Jets has been replaced by confidence found in working with people like Wyatt, Cale & Nico, who have been more than sympathetic to Eno's concepts and ideas. The influence of Cale especially pervades the album. Tracks like "China my China" and "Back in Judy's Jungle" reveal the extent to which Eno's talents have developed. "China", specifically is an outstanding example of Eno's ability to fuse the most separate influences into a coherent whole (it's like Syd Barrett sings John Cale). To define its relationship with Warm Jets one could point to development contained within three three songs on that album: "Baby's on Fire","Driving me Backwards" and "Dead Finks".

As Eno explains: "Of the ideas on that album, one can say that those were new ideas. They are if you like unique to me - or if not unique, then special to me.

"Like 'Baby's on Fire' was written around two notes and that's interesting to me. It's very economical and that interests me at the moment when song structures are so complex in general, that one can write what I think are interesting songs without that kind of complexity. I mean I don't have to rely on the complexity of the structure for the interest of the songs. I can listen to those three songs because there is still a mystery about them for me. Whereas other things on that album, I like but they are completely obvious to me, and it doesn't seem to matter that I did them, they could have been done by somebody else, and that's not such a good feeling actually. I mean one likes to think that you do what you are best at and that there's a certain area that I can do possibly better than anyone else."

The very construction of the album, at least in terms of production and integration of ideas, reveals Eno's increasingly uncompromising, if not eccentric attitude to the standard procedure of recording. To use a specific example of the way in which he was able to transcend and manipulate those basic traditions, there was a strategy he used which involved a set of cards upon which he had written messages to himself, some technical details, others purely conceptual, and others just cryptic notes. "There are maybe 64 cards, whenever I was stuck for a decision in the studios I'd simply refer to these cards whatever card I picked up I would act on. I wouldn't choose one lightly, because the point was I had to observe it, and what it did was to force me to try something out even if it had no chance of working. I'd found that working in studios before you can become so insular and narrow in your focus that you can forget all the great ideas you have outside the studio situation. Often I'd find that I'd get into the studios and it was as if I'd forgotten all the things I wanted to do and just carry on working because the equipment was already set up in a certain way. Studios are usually set up as a means of reproducing an idea which is already set. Now I'm interested in the studio as a way of creating something new, and not at all interested in the distinctions between live and studio because as far as I'm concerned there is just no comparison, they're two entirely different activities. So I used the cards as a way of jolting myself back into thinking about what I was doing".

The unexpected is a quality that runs through the album, from the sleeve by Peter Schmidt to the surprising force of Eno's performance. Again it's the a matter of confidence and the sympathetic co-operation of the musicians, from Robert Wyatt, Phil Manzanera (who these days seems to reserve his most crucial contributions and ideas for his work with people like Eno & Cale) through to Brian Turrington of the Winkies who supplies bass and some beautiful piano on the title track and Fred Smith on drums.

Lyrically, the album derives its strength from Cale's (and again maybe Barrett's) mysterious ambiguity. "I've developed new systems of writing lyrics. One of which is panic. I'd just start writing ideas, just from phonetics and then in the studio I'd have to finalise them. Practically all the lyrics were written in about 15 minutes but they are based on suspicions which existed for some time. But the thing about writing fast is that you don't guard yourself. Because the problem with writing lyrics is that one can become very self-conscious, and when one sees something written down it can look very fixed and over-specific. And this is why I don't have the lyrics printed on the sleeve. As far as I'm concerned my lyrics don't exist as some kind of poetry in their own right, but as part of the music. So it's no more relevant to print the lyrics than it is to score the top line that the guitar is playing."

With this album Eno has reached the same stage as Roxy, and he's still pretty synonymous with that band since his music reflects many of their initial ideas which have since been overlooked. But there's still a feeling of suspicion, almost, toward his actual standing as a musician.

"That's true and if I'd have thought of the critics when I was doing this album I would probably have thrown it out completely. But I know it's good. I have no doubt it's a much better album, because I was able to use far more of the ideas that are important to me. Obviously my role in rock music is not to come up with new musical ideas in any strict sense. It's to come on with new concepts about how you might generate music. It's always time to question what has become standard and established. I figure that in a way, my contribution, if it's received, it will be on a more on a theoretical basis, about suggesting greater freedom in the way people approach music. I'll be very interested in that context to see how this album is received. It's impossible to predict, but it will be interesting."

"the reason I was attracted to the band in the first place was the contradiction of having someone like Eno and someone like Bryan in the same band" Chris Thomas, producer



The totality of Roxy Music today is something far more than the products issued by the five musicians called Roxy Music. When that contradiction finally erupted in the summer of 73, there occurred a big bang style creative episode in our pop music universe, an explosion that left one protagonist wandering with abandon in a random orbit and the other shooting straight toward what he hoped would be his inevitable destiny.

The process continues today with chaos, or at least uncertainty, still fending off an orderly Roxy Cosmos. Bryan Ferry tries to stabilize his flight, to focus and concentrate the zero hour impact. Eno revels in his absence of direction, in his meandering course. He's safe because he's not committed. Ferry has bet it all, and while the consensus is that he'll make it (often expressed as puzzlement that he hasn't made it already), it hasn't happened yet. And the tricky thing about rock and roll's beat the clock is that you never know how much time is left. And then there's this guitarist, Phil....

Since the Ferry-Eno split, the Roxy energy has poured directly into no less than nine albums, with more on the way. The broad diffusion is more the responsibility of Eno, the tireless dabbler, than Ferry on his unswerving path. It engulfs the wing of Island Records which includes John Cale, Nico and Kevin Ayres; the now defunct King Crimson's Robert Fripp (and with that defunction, the possibility of Eno's achieving enough stability to establish a partnership distinctly rears its head); a bungling amateur orchestra called Portsmouth Symphonia, an endearing joke that works for about 10 minutes (get the single, "The William Tell Overture"); Roxy's reed man Andy Mackay, searching for Eddie Riff; and Roxy Music's own albums and two Solo shots by Ferry. If hydraulic principles hold any water, the race could be between Roxy Music proper and the potentially extraordinary range of projects powered by Eno. Implicit there is the need for new ways of perceiving rock 'n' roll, because it's still the blindingly bright light that we look for, not a dazzling array of lesser ones. But a true phenomenon doesn't meet or even exceed expectations. It demolishes them. Don't count anything out.

The contradiction: The avant gardist vs. The classicist, conceptualist vs. The practical, directed mind, anti-hero vs. hero. The hit and hit man on one side, on the other one a man who demands that it all work just like this. Eno's fingers stained from sticking into every pie, Ferry's as pure and pristine as his ivory keyboard. Ferry seeks the spotlight, and Eno seems to want to glow of his own light. When stars collide........

Chris Thomas' production credits include Procol Harum, John Cale, Pink Floyd, Christopher Milk, Badfinger, Japan's Sadistic Mika Band, and Roxy Music's second and third albums (For Your Pleasure & Stranded). His recollection of that crucial period is tempered with an understandable disclaimer : " I'm sitting here and I'm caught in the middle because I really admire Bryan and what he's doing and I really like Eno and I like what he's doing, and if I talk about them I'm going to slag one or the other or I'm going to point out criticisms of one or the other...I was always caught in the middle and it was driving me nuts. I just wanted to make a record. Everyone was taking sides."

Stuck in the middle like the time he was chatting with some friends on the staircase outside Elton John's Christmas party: "I saw Eno standing there (points down) and Bryan Ferry standing there (up). Eno was going to go in, and Bryan was going to go out, but they were sort of like you know (fists together, head on face off). I suddenly saw Eno, I suddenly saw Bryan, and I just went screaming up the stairs going 'hello, hello, hello, hello!' and rushed into the party. They would not pass. It was amazing! Hopefully, both of them will do what they want to do and get to a point where they can pass each other on the stairs."

Without question, a prime feud. A bit of perspective, please: "Obviously, these things happen. It's nothing rare. It happens in every band. The only reason it affects me is that I have to be sitting down there making a record, and these kind of things put so much pressure on you. Because you want to sit down and make the record. You don't want to read the paper, you can't even decide if you want to drink coffee or tea when it gets down to that point. You don't want to know any of the things that are going on. Andy was so upset when we did Stranded, about Eno leaving, that there was a tension there between Andy and Bryan. Andy was telling me this and Bryan was telling me that and I was always in the middle. But they're alright now. I think they are alright now. I hope they are alright now."

For Your Pleasure, Roxy's second, was Eno's last album with the group.

"When I was working on the second album I was not aware of the tensions that were going on. If Eno said something to Bryan or Bryan said something to Eno, I thought, 'Well that's a bit strange', I just thought one of them was probably moody. It was only when Eno was out of the band that it all came out. Andy phoned me up and told me, and I screamed and was pulling my hair out, I didn't know what to do. I mean it all settled down. It's just that obviously when something like that happens to a band, every member of the band is wondering what the hell's going on."

Roxy Music was, and is, Ferry's band but all eyes, especially those of the Americans who saw Roxy on its late 72 US tour, were invariably fixed on the enticing, sinister, spangled and feathered vision at stage right that was Eno. The process of indentification / association was obvious and immediate. The whole band looked spectacular, but even so Eno stood out. You can't tell the players without a program or the leader without a bio, and audiences simply assumed that Eno was Roxy Music while Bryan pumped away at the opposite side, singing and sweating and getting as much recognition as a ventriloquist's dummy. "After that," says Thomas, "Eno developed into more and more a star in England....it came out, and the end result you've seen."

Eno became a celebrity in England not because he released a record that everyone loved and bought, but because he was clever and glib and talkative and extremely photogenic and unafraid of mild controversy - good copy, or at least easy copy, as opposed to Ferry's forbidding, taciturn, aloof aura. It was as if Eno turned his records or concerts or even his ideas into stars, rather than have his output establish him as one.

Which is the way Eno, true dilettante that he is, would prefer it. He likes to call himself a non-musician, abhors specialization, and says things like, "I'm not good at being a live performer. I'm not anywhere near as good at that as I am doing interviews." (A true virtuoso of the art, in fact: "One day I did 32 interviews. It was in Italy, and they couldn't speak English that well and I can speak French reasonably well, so sometimes I would answer in French. They thought I was so clever.")

Eno's musicianship, what he actually does, is always a nebulous matter. It's often something like "treating tapes" and it generally involves implementation of a theoretical framework. When he begins talking about systems and structures, one is tempted to picture him ensconced on a university campus or wherever it is that contemporary "serious" musicians (to whom he constantly makes reference) ply their trade these days. But Eno has long since flown that coop.

"I really think that rock 'n' roll is the most important art form full stop. You can tell by the amount of focus it gets. Anything that that many people are interested in is the place that's most important as far as I'm concerned. And though I am still very interested in avant-garde music, I find it an extremely atrophied art form.

"It suffers what every art form that has to defend itself suffers, I mean rock music doesn't have to defend itself basically, it's going to make money, people are going to live by it, and they don't have to encourage people to buy their records, or get research grants or whatever, and so they don't have to rationalize positions if they don't want to. It's been one of the great failings of modern jazz and avant garde music and avant garde painting and a lot of other things that they felt it necessary to justify their position, but in the most limited of terms, in kind of bankers' terms almost - what's rationally justifiable, and of course what's rationally justifiable is not what you are talking about. What's rationally justifiable you don't need to deal with. Because it's the things that for some reason are irrationally attractive that one is interested in."

So for all the homage he pays to Steve Reich, John Cage, Morton Feldman and Terry Riley, et al., Rock 'n' Roll is Eno's chosen arena. After the split with Roxy, he took to the road in England, backed by a pub band called the Winkies, with songs from his Here Come the Warm Jets album, The reviews were generally favorable and appreciative, but after five or six gigs, one of his lungs quite inconveniently collapsed (and some absolutely amazing things happened in the hospital, plastic tube protruding from his chest, but that's another story....). It was really an exchange of one art form of boredom for another.

"After about three gigs with the same band doing the same numbers, unless it's constructed around a different premise of playing - which is why I might do it in a while, when I work out what that premise might be - you learn to comfortably accommodate every dangerous situation. It's not really very interesting. It happened with Roxy. It took quite a long time to happen with Roxy. I mean there was a fair period of touring that was really good. I'd like working on a premise much more like Steve Reich's music is constructed, where the role of each performer is quite well determined, but the interactions are liable to generate accidents and differences that you can either respond to or not respond to. It isn't the situation of one performer stepping out and other laying back and then another one stepping out. It's a situation of always having an even line of equally rated performers who interact in a number of different ways....It's hard to do , because it takes a lot of courage not to provide a focus, for a start, because there are so many easy and obvious ways of getting an audience, and it's so tempting."

One of Eno's endeavors along those lines is the version of "Baby's on Fire" which he performed at the Rainbow in London during a concert that should achieve legendary status without too much trouble (it's partially preserved on the recently released June 1 1974 album). Eno, Nico, Cale and Kevin Ayres, avid mutual admirers, had found themselves all on the Island label, and under the guidance of A&R head Richard Williams, organized the one-night grand stand.

"It was one of the rare London audiences that would let you make a few mistakes," says Eno, "In London they hardly ever do. You've got to be really top in London to play there, unless you're a crap band like ELP or something like that, where you can play anything you want for tedious hours - the tedium is the message...People are very very demanding there, and they don't allow a single lapse. You can immediately see the yawns if something starts to go wrong. But the audience was very generous. I think generally in England everybody appreciated the idea of us doing the concert anyway....it was a nice concert. I mean it was very informal, but not sloppy at all, and it wasn't a jamming concert . And yet it didn't feel tense."

It's always projects with Eno, with little distinction drawn between ones that are actualized and those that remain in the conceptual realm. There's a scenario called "Luna and the Lizard Girls"; The Plastic Eno Band is about halfway there (he has over 130 plastic instruments in his collection, and will go on at length - "They're the nearest instruments to electronic instruments that you can find ....the thing that interests me about them is that plastic is not a resonant material, and so they don't have harmonics...."): Over a million feet of tape lines his walls; he has invented and constructed an instrument called the electric larynx; the regular stream of interviews and photos in the British weeklies certainly qualify as pieces; he produced the Portsmouth Sinfonia's album and occasionally performs with the orchestra (on clarinet which he doesn't really play); he produced John Cale's new album. Eno has it set up so that normal patterns of evaluation don't apply. You must either ignore it all or review his clothes and everything else as you would a show or a record.

Among the more conventional efforts are two LPs - his solo album and his collaboration with Fripp, No Pussyfooting. The latter, recorded casually in Eno's home studio two years ago, features two tracks: "The Heavenly Music Corporation" is Fripp guitar and Eno treated tape, and Eno adds Synth. to the tiny arsenal on side two's "Swastika Girls" The marketing aspects are as interesting as the musical:

"In England," says Eno "the Fripp-Eno record is on a cheap label, and it was important to us because it was a non-financial statement - this is something that we're putting out cheap because we want to be able to take a risk at it and not think that you've been burned when you buy it. It was about half the price of an ordinary record. I would have put it out cheaper if I could have done. But it was like saying 'well, we're not certain; we didn't put a lot of work into this, but we like it'. And we'd like to put it out on a level that an artist would put out a print or something..... but it got reviewed just like any other album. There isn't any other category. The failure in the art field is that it's always such a minority market - a print is only going to be received by 50 people. And the great thing about rock music is that it has the possibility of being reviewed by a very very large number of people. Somehow, I'd like to be able to tread the line between the two."

Eno concocted, rather than performed in the accepted sense, his solo album, Here Come the Warm Jets (the credit reads: "Eno sings all other vocals and occasionally plays simplistic keyboards, snake guitar, electric larynx, and treats the other tapes"). The materials he worked with were really people, like Fripp and Crimson's John Wetton, and Andy Mackay, Phil Manzanera and Paul Thompson from Roxy, et al. His songs are in turn tender and intensely raucous, pastoral and chaotic, and the whole thing is marked by a light and engaging air which is fairly surprising in light of the ponderousness one might have expected from this highly theoretical and experimental performer.

"When I was working on my album," he says, "I'd deliberately construct these situations where I would find somebody with one musical identity and put him together with someone with a completely different musical identity, because I wanted to see what friction would happen between them. The worst thing that could happen would be they'd simply go away and say, 'Well, Eno's a silly bugger, he should never have put us together.' But they wouldn't feel any animosity toward each other......But it would be a dangerous situation to perform in any context where there isn't the detachment you have when you're working on an external work."

Chris Thomas was involved with Jets, mixing and adding some bass and drum overdubs, and his attitude toward Eno is much less flippant than Eno's own self-appraisal: "I think when he insists he's a non-musician he's making an excuse for himself. This is really personal opinion, and he might laugh if I said it to him, but I think that that is an excuse. Because he is a musician, because you can't make a record like that......going back to For Your Pleasure, he wasn't working in an amateur way at all. He's the one that would sit there until four or five in the morning working on something. "Eno's album, I think, is fantastic. He wrote those songs in about ten days. He just turns them out like that. When I was working on that album, I'd be mixing or something and he'd be down in the studio playing the piano with like three fingers or something, and he'd have this little tape recorder down there and he'd come up and say, 'I've written a song,' and he'd play it to me and it'd be great! He's phenomenal. It just pours out of him. I really think he needs to discipline himself and get it done right.....

"I think he could really, really do well. I mean I was astonished when I started working on the album, because I heard the tracks bit by bit, one by one. Every song he came up with was so fantastic and so completely different from the one before.....You never know what he's going to do tomorrow, or in an hour's time. That's the great thing. Every now and again it came down to the point where we had to sort things out. If he'd organized it better, if the first things on the session had been organized - he needs to produce his own record, very definitely, because that's where it all comes from.....He needs complete freedom to do whatever he needs, but there has to be somebody to say, 'No - but I understand what you are trying to do, and if you want to do it then the way to do it is to do it like this."

Eno thrives because he defines his own environment, increasing the variables at his disposal and so insuring almost complete adaptability, But there are always the uncontrollable things to be dealt with; while Ferry challenges them head on, testing the premise that it can be planned and calculated, Eno accepts and incorporates them, as much as possible, into his system.

"There is quite a lot of aggression in what I'm interested in," he says.

"There's an undertone of aggression in it. But it's not - what I've the decided the final term to describe it might be is bewildered aggression. Like when a bull has been struck a few times and it's just crazy, but not crazy in any direction - it's just running around, shaking its horns and running at anything. It's a completely unfocused sort of aggression. It's bewildered aggression. Like", Eno laughs, "Why am I here and why am I so angry?"

And if Eno becomes a full-fledged star and is faced with all the rank's internal pressures and external responsibilities? No, he'll have to alter those expectations too, because he already has some problems, even at his present level. Like after the Rainbow concert: "It was the most terrifying experience of my life, I think, because it was like - well shit, I couldn't believe it. There were people, just millions of them, coming up and saying, 'how are you doing? Great gig!' and I literally ran away. That's the only time that I've run out of a place, because I was scared of being stopped on the way out by more people saying the same thing."

And if he is a star, then he's a hero, and that may not fit too comfortably: "The reason I'm skeptical of the idea of heroes is that I know the utter fallibility and idiocy of most of the people who are heroes currently. I don't mean they're idiots, but I mean they're very screwed-up people really. Everybody I can think of who's a star, with the exception of Gary Glitter, is screwy."

Ferry wants to be a hero, and is fixated on making it. While Eno affects a futuristic aura, Ferry reaches back to synthesize all the heroic elements he can grab, from Lord Byron to Errol Flynn to Billy Fury. He's adopted the elegant look having moved quickly and wisely away from the more outrageous image that would have sunk with the glitter ship. He once flanked the band at stage left now he's out front. Roxy Music is his band now, without any question, the outcome remains undecided at the moment, despite Roxy's continuing popularity in the homeland, because Ferry, unlike someone like Sparks, cannot be content with limited, basic and merely comfortable sphere of influence. Sooner or later he's going to have to give America another try.

That one tour a long time ago didn't do it, essentially because they didn't sound very good. "This is where failure in one field can alter your ideas," says Chris Thomas. "Because when Bryan came back from America he was talking about the fact that he didn't want to go back there and tour again. He wasn't really interested in it. Because it was their first thing that ever failed, whereas in England, right from the beginning, they'd done very, very well. And now that they're beginning to pick up, he's getting enthusiastic about America." (At present, though, no tour of the States has been arranged.)

Roxy's fourth album is all wrapped up along with Ferry's two solo albums. Andy Mackay has one out in England, a light charming instrumental brew called In search of Eddie Riff. And there's this guitarist, Phil Manzanera.....

"On Stranded, says Thomas, "the way we did that was we recorded all the backing tracks, which was basically piano, bass and drums. And Phil would listen, take the tape home and work out his guitar part, and he would transform those tracks so much, it was totally amazing......I don't think he's got a particular style, which is probably a good thing in that people aren't going to say, 'oh he did that on that.' But he's going to emerge. People are going to realize how much he's given the records. I really think Phil's given an awful lot to both the Roxy albums that I've worked on.....I'm sure he is going to go 'bang' one day or another, it doesn't matter if it's five year's time."

Stranded finally brought Roxy's concept and execution into proper relationship, and its blend of wryness and true romantic anguish, of searing rock and haunting atmospheres, substantiate the entire Ferry mystique and make his program something other than the hollow desperate hype it sometimes seems to be. Chris Thomas on Ferry: "He's very much like me.....I'm always very paranoid about my position. I think everything is going to sort of collapse and I'd better do it now. So you end up just working yourself into the grave. I said to him, 'Look, don't make that mistake. Just take it easy and do it right. Do it till you do it right.' I mean he was working too fast, that was the thing. He'd just finished his solo album, and a week later he was in there doing Stranded. And that's why I was saying to him, 'Take your time.' Because I think he is one of the most important artists to come out of England in the last six years. He and Bowie. And he just needs to settle down a little bit. He's calculating every move, but he could make all those things better......He's still got a lot of time to develop. I think it's a question of channeling those things two things, experimentation and discipline, and using the right one at the right time.....

"A lot of people are just interested in doing it and if it's going to sell - you know, once they get it to the point where they know it's alright, then it's alright. I think it's much more important to take it as far as you can possibly go. It doesn't matter if you're out at the studio for two months and you're a wreck and you're a vegetable and you can't talk to anybody, if you've achieved something. I think it's really necessary to push yourself that far. And that's why it's important for Bryan to take rests."

The Inmates Have Taken Over

Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Nico, Eno & the Soporifics

From Creem, December 1974, by Richard Cromelin

Suggested Subtitle: The Persecution and Assassination of Conventional Musical Approaches by the Inmates of Island Records Under the Supervision of Richard Williams and Brian Eno.

What It Is: John Cale, Nico, Eno and Kevin Ayers, having found themselves on the same label, decided to present a concert at London's Rainbow Theatre.

Some First Thoughts: Island Records is now to the Esoterica wing of rock what Bearsville is to the Woodstock People, what Capricorn is to Southern boogie, what Casablanca is to desperate mutations, what Asylum is to the folkie elite. That's good because it might establish unpredictability as a workable force in the music biz (FutureFlash: Island becomes first major label to institute automatic mental-breakdown clause in all artist contracts...). Culturally, the concert was analogous to a major Dada exhibition back in its heyday; the Academy, in peril, will ignore or scoff, but time will inevitably mold it into an Event...

Here Comes the Warm Jet or Eno Sheds Some Light: "One reason for the concert was an artistic one, which was that we all really like each other as artists, and we all feel to some extent that we're roughly in the same area... We just had a meeting and decided it would be a nice idea, and then we rehearsed very, very hard, and that was very enjoyable. Working for just one concert is a very nice idea, 'cause you know you're going to be able to do things that wouldn't be feasible over thirty nights.

"...[John Cale] did a really interesting version of 'Heartbreak Hotel,' in a minor key. It's incredibly suicidal. I mean you could never believe that that song could turn out to be such a downer as that... Nico did 'Deutschland Uber Alles,' which was very good... and she did 'The End' by the Doors, which is the one they put on the album... Nico doing 'The End' was so chilling, it really was. It was incredible. She invests it with so many levels of meaning I didn't hear in the Doors' one. She underplays it... there's just the harmonium, me playing synthesizer -- almost doubling the harmonium part -- and her singing... which is just like a rich, kind of non-specific miasma of sound...

"Each person [on "Baby's on Fire"] had a part that was absolutely definite...Each performer had about four little parts, each of which was moved on a little bit from the previous part. When he moved to the next part wasn't critical, but he had to stay there then for a while; he couldn't move back to the one before, so it wasn't like a jamming idea at all... There's always this kind of mesh thing happening as different parts are overlaid... I did that as an encore and the instruments were incredibly out of tune, so out of tune you wouldn't believe it. But it sounds fantastic. There's one little bit in it where there's a riff between the guitar and one of the bassists, and they're so out of tune it sounds like cellos. Amazing! I mean if you tried to make that sound in the studio it would have taken you ages. You wouldn't have thought of making it, in fact, it's such a bizarre sound. And the piano and guitar are quite well out of tune as well. Ha!"

The Album: Both of Eno's songs are on Here Come the Warm Jets, but these live versions are different enough to have musical as well as collectors' value. The mix on "Driving Me Backwards" gives his slithering voice due prominence, as the slippery, oozing music sucks you in like a slow, malicious undertow. It's a somber, crazy, difficult piece of music, an unlikely album opener but, it turns out, the ideal mood-setter. "Baby's on Fire" is indeed out of tune (it really does sound like cellos, that riff -- roll over, ELO), and it is fantastic. If Frogs is ever on TV again, turn down the sound and play this track over and over; Ray Milland, frogs flying into his wheelchair from every which way, would feel sorry for you.

The imaginative contemplator of suicide could utilize the rest of side one: Wire some speakers up on the inside of the oven, turn on the clean-burning natural gas, and start with "Heartbreak Hotel." Elvis Presley as Venus in Furs. Cale's fixated, possessed, nearly monotonic singing sits with disturbing calm in a boiling, dark mass of Enoise, tortured guitar riffs and the harpy chorus of Doreen and Irene Chanter and Liza Strike. It unfailingly takes you to the brink, and then comes Nico's song.

Her "The End" is the soundtrack for the free-fall to the bottom. It's a totally mesmerizing performance by this lady hidden in musical mists, yet at the same time all too clear. If Morrison sang it as a lizard, Nico is a sightless bird, lost but ever-so-calm, somehow knowing the right direction. She is the pure, dead marble of a ruined Acropolis, a crumbling column on the subterranean bank of Morrison's River Styx.

Kevin Ayers gets all of side two because he was more or less the headliner. Of the four, he's the least-known in America, and his five selections comprise a good, if incomplete, introduction.

He makes you think of Elliott Murphy a little, the way he's both derivative and distinctive. He comes off more as an individualist than an actual eccentric, and he seems to be one of the few cultstars without an identifiable gimmick.

"May I" sounds like a meeting of mellow Velvet Underground and "Positively 4th Street" Dylan before it slips into a jazzy Astral Weeks shuffle. It's musically diverting, and its mood is vivid, but it doesn't go very far as it settles for being a quick, warm, sidewalks-of-Paris sketch. From there it's a good variety show: The Dylan-via-Murphy "Shouting in a Bucket Blues," then "Stranger in Blue Suede Shoes," which, with Bowie's "Queen Bitch," can sit proudly at the feet of the Velvets. "Everybody's Sometime and Some People's All the Time Blues," an amble through old Greenwich Village folk stylings, works better as mood than philosophy. "Two Goes into Four" sounds like it was written on an acid trip with the Incredible String Band.

Ayers' persona is sincere (and sometimes even a bit sappy), somewhat wide-eyed yet worldly-wise. His deep voice is erratic but expressive, with a roughness that will be interpreted as charm by those who want to like it. Unlike Nico, Cale or Eno, Ayers shows little avant-garde leaning, either verbally ("May I sit and stare at you for a while?" is about as offbeat as he gets) or musically. In addition to the suggestions of Dylan and the VU, there are strains of the "progressive folk" school (like John Martyn) and a Syd Barrett tenuousness.

The backing is first rate (musicians include Cale and Eno, Rabbit, Robert Wyatt) and is highlighted by the guitar solos from Ollie Halsall and Mike Oldfield.

A person like Ayers needs time to seep into the people's consciousness and collect an audience. It sounds promising, but the sampling we get here is too small. A Volume Two album from the concert would be welcome soon, both for some more of Ayers and because there are lots of us who would kill for the chance to hear Nico sing "Deutschland Uber Alles."

When Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno calls himself a non-musician, he isn’t confessing a fault or admitting a deficiency. His self-evaluation us a proud stroke against obsolete concepts in rock’n’roll, he is a madcap ringmaster in the center ring introducing an act that will not only make music sound different, but change what it means.

He’s called Eno; you may put Brian in front if you like. From 1972 through August ’73, he, electro-wizard in peacock feather radiance, the sultry Marlene Dietrich of rock ‘n’ roll, was one of the most visible elements of the suddenly most visible band in the land. The faintly sinister, futuristic pole opposite Bryan Ferry’s urbane elegance. It’s been said that somewhere between the two there existed Roxy Music. Eno left the group on July 23, 1973.

Eno had originally joined them as sound mixer and electronics supervisor on the invitation of Roxy’s saxophonist/oboeist Andrew Mackay, who met Eno when the latter lectured at Reading University. England’s art schools have produced some of England’s greatest pop figures, Eno being the latest in that distinguished lin of descent. From 1964-66 he studied painting at Ipswich Art School (after elementary ‘education’ at the Convent of Jesus and Mary and St Joseph’s College), and went on to Winchester College of Art where he became involved in the non-disciplines on which he non-bases his art – conceptual art, machines, processes, sound. Influenced by such notable contemporary composers as John Tilbury and Cornelius Cardew, he formed the avant-garde troupe Merchant Taylor’s Simultaneous Cabinet and a rock band called Maxwell Demon.

And it was here that he discovered the tape recorder. He once owned 31 at a time.

“Clear statement is like an art object: it is the afterlife of the process which called it into being. The process itself is the significant step…” – Edmund Carpenter

“It seems to me that every invention this century has been to do with seeing things in terms of processes, not statics.” – Eno, interviewed in Sounds

The tape recorder (his favorite instrument) processes, collages time. A year ago the shelves of his wall held one-and-a-half million feet of tape. To each can be added, at whim or will, the sounds of an Eno who’s very different from the Eno who made a tape a long time ago. When he sang with Maxwell Demon at Winchester he made up the words as he went along. Eno understands that situations influence music, that simply turning an instrument on changes the preconceived musical idea. He knows that there is no such thing as pure repetition of a sound, because with each return it changes according to the listener’s growing familiarity. Eno accepts the inevitability of flaws, is fond of incorporating mistakes, and so appreciates the Velvet Underground. He savors a chaotic (while emotionally coherent) synthesis of diverse instruments, and so he joined Roxy Music.

Eno admits to intellectual premises (unfashionable in rock ’n’ roll) and intuitive, emotional processes (likewise in the fine arts). He keeps journals which he fills with graphs, charts, diagrams; but he claims that he does his best work when he’s tired and his will yields to his intuition, and he says he thinks that the accidents are more interesting than the things he does intentionally. Many of his ideas are extracted directly from his dreams. His Dada was a postman.

“Music is no longer for listening to, but for merging with.” – Carpenter, ibid.

“One of the things that I’m particularly interested in is the overall quality of sound, the synergy of sound, that is the sum of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.” – Eno, ibid.

Eno is rock ‘n’ roll, Eno is pop. He’s recorded a single, “Seven Deadly Finns”, and is generally fascinated by the format. Though not in love with the life of the touring musician, he took his live show on the road in England where, backed by a pub band called Winkies, he offered selections from his initial solo release, Here Come The Warm Jets. The album features oplaying by King Crimson’s Robert Fripp, Chris Spedding of Sharks, Hawkwind’s Simon King and others of adventurous persuasion, all under Eno’s aegis. In such situations he creates the chemistry, merges the ingredients, and incorporates the fact that no one can precisely predict the outcome.

Eno prefers to write (or recall from dreams) lyrics of low definition, non-specific words that involve the listener more thoroughly and lend the piece a suggestion of mysrtey. He has listed the qualities that “endorse the kinds of feelings I try to inject into the music: sexy / insane / grotesque / sinister / beautiful / passionate / incessant / desperate / angular / reptilian” (from a catalogue note for the Museum of Modern Art, Lucerne).

“I never erase anything.” – Eno, ibid.

Among the projects (some in progress, some completed, some conceptual) Eno has undertaken since leaving Roxy Music are: Here Come The Warm Jets; ACNE (a colation of himself, John Cale, Nico and Kevin Ayers); producing many records – John Cale, Andy Mackay, Portsmouth Sinfonia (a collection of amateur musicians who play your favourite classics), Magoic Michael (itinerant songsmith), Pan-Am Steelband, and Moodies (an all-woman band); No Pussyfooting, an album of Fripp guitar treated with tape and synthesizer by Eno, recorded in one day in Eno’s home (cheap and successful); the invention of the electric larynx – bondage meets electronic music; the Plastic Eno Band (the sounds of Eno’s extensive collection of plastic instruments manipulated on tape); and Luana and the Lizard Girls (“One of the Lizard Girls is bound, naked and gagged, face down on the operating table. One of the rhythm guitarists is stretching her arms. Luana the surgeon lifts the whip (the bamboo whip). The first six blows occur at regular school intervals. The pace quickens for the final eleven…”) – based on, what else, a dream; and, of course, a second, even more ambitious album, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).

In Taking Tiger Mountain Eno is aided and abetted by, amoung others, Roxy’s Phil Manzanera and former Soft Machinist, Matching Moler, and the only avant-gardist to have a major hit with an old Monkees tune (Neil Diamond’s cassic “I’m A Believer”), Robert Wyatt. Also appearing at different points in the ascension of Tiger Mountain are The Portsmouth Sinfonia, Randi & The Pyramids, The Simplistics and Roxy’s Andy Mackay.

As in the past, Eno’s use of language serves to pre-determine the direction of the listener’s mind. Such titles as “Burning Airlines Give You So Much More”, “The Fat Lady Of Limbourg” and “Mother Whale Eyeless” leave no question as to Eno’s disorienting intentions, and he follows through marvelously, both lyrically and musically.

Eno’s strategy employs musics of varied styles and origins – from primitive to futuristic; jazz to classical; circus to ragtime; and even some tried and true rock ‘n’ roll. Taking Tiger Mountain is a collage of images delved from Eno’s mind and mindlessness. His vision is sometimes disturbing and sometimes elevating, but, nonetheless, Eno has become a truly unique force in music.

“The specialist has become a comic figure, replaced by the artist.” – Carpenter, ibid.

“I maintain that one of my talents is being completely amateur in everything I do.” – Eno, “19” Magazine.

Brian Peter George St. John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno was born on May 15, 1948, in Woodbridge, Suffolk.

“Psychologists were recently called in to aid a boy who couldn’t move or speak unless an electronic cord , attached to his body, was plugged in.” – Carpenter, ibid.

The Lone Star Synthesizer Op talks to Chris Salewicz.



From New Musical Express, December 7 1974, by Chris Salewicz, kindly provided by Jeffrey Morgan



Well, I suppose we should start as we intend to continue. So come along, Eno, how does it feel to be just regarded as Good Copy?

Brian Eno's cackles burble into speech: "I'm not any more am I? I thought I'd said it all.

"I take great pains now not to say anything that's Good Copy because it becomes a headline. So I'll avoid saying anything controversial, pointed... I'm lacking in the innocence that..."

CUT.

Yes, well there we have it. You see, Eno would appear to have rather overdone it. There he is, probably the most supreme self-publicist currently amongst British rock musicians and quite capable of filling yards of column inches every time he opens his mouth.

Except that it never seems to quite work out the way it's intended.

Okay, so it's indubitably true - whatever anyone would now claim - that he was the first member of Roxy Music to grab anvone's attention. Anyway, that just ensured that he was asked if he'd like to consider a solo career.

Then there was the superstud duo with Robert Fripp and the adventure of having six young ladies in thirty hours. Well, that would have certainly been a quite commendable and enviable display of hedonism had Brian Eno not then collapsed and been obliged to retire to the Canaries to recuperate.

And we haven't even yet considered the crowning tour de force of psyching just about every music writer in the States back in the summer. Which was, in retrospect, possibly not so good a move as far as English journalists who read it were concerned. Let's face it, no matter how much the press may privately moan about the cabbage brains that fill the heads of the majority of rock stars it's still eminently more satisfactory than having a situation where The Artist may attempt to answer back. Fragile egos are prevalent on both sides of the fence, you know.

Now it's also considered rather bad form for an artist not to live the life that his public - and more specifically The Media - expect of him. Somewhat fallaciously Brian Eno had come to be regarded as something of a ligger during his spell with Roxy Music. The mere fact that the rest of the band seemed, in the main - and that Eno might occasionally do something as risqué as drinking wine direct from the bottle - no doubt contributed to this.

Whatever the reasons, however, it was tacitly assumed that any music-making he might do after leaving Roxy would contain the ostentatiously flamboyant side of that band.

Which, of course, it didn't Both "No Pussyfooting" - the album he recorded with Robert Fripp, and, to a lesser extent, Here Come The Warm Jets, the first Eno solo album, turned out to be expressions of a fairly rigorous electronic ascetisism.

Now this was just not on and it quite seriously upset certain of the fragile egos who, unable to come to terms with the unexpected, gave both albums the critical cold shoulder and would appear to be not even considering wasting any venom - or thought - on Taking Tiger Mountain, the new Eno album, a record which your writer finds both innovative and melodically warming.

However, all this duly accepted, it must be admitted that there were one or two lingering suspicions that there was little point in re-reading my notes in the cab journey to Eno's Maida Vale - mansion flat; that he would almost certainly have prepared a set of both answers and questions which would be dictated onto my cassette machine during the moments when we weren't discussing the merits of his digital calculator.

Instead, though, a pot of Earl Grey was immediately provided by the carpenter who was putting up a set of shelves in the hall and we wandered about the rooms in verbal foreplay discussing the Serpentine Gallery chic of the decor and self-consciously avoiding wasting any words that were only to be used when the formal interview was under way.

The arrival of photographer Erika Echenberg provided the self-justification for her subject to change from a rather rustic, check shirt into what he apparently regarded as a more seemly piece of black schmatah. And then, after an hour of Eno posing playing synthesizer, Eno posing playing five-string guitar, and Eno playing at playing at hiding his baldness with a beret, we were sprawled out on the satin cushions on the floor of his front room.

Which is where you came in.

So stop rambling, Eno. Now what about this suspicion that I so many people would appear to have that your whole attitude is little more than... well, a piss-take?

Brian Eno almost drops his Golden Virginia roll-up: "Of anything in particular?"

Well, of music in general, actually.

"No, I'm not actually."

Yes, but I know that there are a considerable amount of people who distrust what you are doing. And that to a very large extent that springs from the Eno-as-media-manipulator schmear.

"Well," says the scourge of the synthesizer, as he takes up a neo-yoga position on the floor, "I think that it springs probably more from the bit that I'm interested in this idea of trying to do things the easy way actually.

"And the fact is that it's only in the last six years or so that anyone's ever bothered about skill in rock music. But it's become quite a fetish recently. And I think that gets resented a bit - partly because what I do comes out sounding not like I that, perhaps.

"But about Pete Erskine's sensitive review... he obviously felt that I was attempting to take the piss."

Mr. Erskine of Long Acre, in his review of Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy), had voiced the opinion that "The Next Week Box has more literary swing than most of this stuff'' and that "his material has smacked of the bogus".

So how did you react to that, then?

"Actually when I read reviews like that the problem is that I immediately believe them, you know, in the sense that I take them seriously.

"Whatever anybody says about what I've done - unless it's completely far-fetched - Ithink that they must be right because I don't consider that I'm a very good judge of it actually. And I don't say that out of modesty but simply because with this album in particular it's still too close for me. And I'm still just hearing errors.

"Actually, I can hear mistakes much worse than the ones he pointed out."

The pregnant pause suggests that obviously I'm not expected to inquire further. Naturally, therefore, specifics are demanded: "I'm not saying and I'll tell you why. What are mistakes to me might be good points for other people and I don't want to stop them being good points.

Hmmmm.

Now listen, young Eno, you would appear to be wriggling a little here. Now are you, in fact, quite consciously reaching for Musical Validity? You obviously feel that you're not being given sufficient credence.

"Well, I'm conscious that I want to... I don't want to take the easy way out."

You're after Credibility?

"Yes, I suppose I am really. Yeah. I mean I want to... on the one hand I don't want to be taken seriously if you know what I mean."

Well, you're obviously aware that on that point you have, to quite a large extent, succeeded remarkably well. But what of this problem of people - and critics in particular - being a little unsure of the sincerity of Brian Eno? It is, I suppose, quite feasible that because your music is not exactly easily classifiable then, therefore, a fairly easy solution is to get the critical boot in.

"Yeah, well I think that's true but I don't intend to change that situation really," declares A True Artist. "It's always been true in rock music as in any other art form that you make money and friends - and fans - by being consistent.

"The Floyd, the other night, they gave a good instance of this. They make their money and their fans now on doing ideas that they actually had six or seven years ago. And they haven't chnnged the basic ideas - all they've done is publish them and refine them and take off all the crude edges and now lots of people like them. It doesn't make the ideas any worse but they're not an innovative band anymore.

"And it's always a temptation because you know if you keep doing the same thing you'll get very good at it."

However, you yourself have not been into rock for even as long a time as the Pink Floyd, have you now?

Eno nods in acquiescence.

In fact, I believe I'm correct in assuming that it wasn't until the time of the Pink Floyd that you became interested in rock.

"Yes. In fact, about the time of That Band, actually..."

Yet now you yourself are working within it and presumably you must regard it as some form of career structure as well as....

Eno butts in very vigorously: "No, no, no. I'm not confined to being a rock musician. That's the thing. See, I think that the best situation I could get into would be one where it wasn't expected that I would make another album like the one before.

"You see, one of the problems was that when I released the Fripp/Eno album a lot of people thought... it hurt so many people's expectations of what I was going to do next... so many people expected a particular kind of album that a lot of people were disappointed in it.

"But having made that I then did Here Come The Warm Jets and a lot of people thought that would be another Fripp/Eno album. So I got the same reaction in reverse.

"Of course, the enviable situation to be in is where there aren't set expectations about what you're going to do next and where people actually don't buy on trust because thay think 'Oh. Another Eno album. Must be good,'," he glances at me and shrugs his shoulders, "Or 'must be terrible'. Or whatever they think."

Now it's all very well to hear Eno, who is by now on excellent form, adrenalin rushing through his musical thoughts. There is, though the little point that Taking Tiger Mountain does rather break down the thesis on which he's just been expounding, as it's of a fairly similar nature to Warm Jets.

Alright, Phil Manzanera may have co-produced it. "None of his motives are self-interest, you know. He's quite an amazing person to actually be in a band like Roxy and to be not obsessed with self-projection" and it may have cost only about a thousand pounds more than Warm Jets ("which is about twenty per cent more") and it may be, in some rather spurious way, something of a rock ballet. The fact does remain, though, that it's not exactly too far removed in either sound or formula from the last album. Which is not exactly in keeping with what you've just been telling us, Brian.

"Well, I tend to think that I spread my activities in a kind of fan, you know. With the kind of avante-garde side over here and the rock side somewhere over there and the rock part probably occupies that segment and then there's the avante-garde segment. And the Sinfonia's over there somewhere, too.

(Don't worry. He's not indicating with his hands so you're not missing anything.) "Here Come The Warm Jets is in that area and so is Taking Tiger Mountain so they're obviously going to be related in some way.

"But I want to have the freedom to move over to the other side of the fan whenever I want. Well, I do have the freedom - I sell enough records not to have to worry about selling the records really."

Alright, Eno. Could we please have an explanation as to what exactly the Tiger Mountain Ballet is?

"I was just wondering if I had the cards handy," he mutters, picking at his nose in an expansive gesture demonstrating the human frailty of rock musicians."It's a Peking Revolutionary Ballet - they're heavily into ballets there as a means of propagandising the Maoist ideal... I don't actually know what the story of the ballet is. It's just a straightforward thing about the workers over-coming the troops..." Ahah. Got you. Now this is a perfect example of the kind of thing which often makes you appear very suspect. For example, I'm slightly suspicious that these cards even exist.

"'I'll show them to you in a minute..."

But you do have a tendency to... how shall we put it? Exaggerate?

"Oh. I make some things up, yes."

Yes, I seem to recollect that when Roxy first started you said something to the effect that you owned two mansion flats in Maida Vale. As it is, you rent one. "Crying Wolf" is what I believe this is known as.

Eno's laughter is just possibly disguising a certain amount of squirming: "No, when I say that they're real they usually are. I don't usually bother to hide my deceptions particularly because they're just for fun.

"But that really is a ballet and I'm not a Maoist. I really did find the set of Taking Tiger Mountain postcards in San Francisco. Simon" (this is believed to be a reference to Simon Puxley, a publicist) "was with me at the time, in fact. That really verifies it.

"The reason I liked the title - on reflection... I think it's just the contradiction of 'By Strategy' and 'Taking Tiger Mountain' - one of which was so mediaeval and remote and the other which was terribly modern and to do with computers and war games and that kind of thing. I just liked ..."

Wait a minute. Do you actually understand that by saying that you're leaving yourself open for a terrible amount of criticism on the lines of you're just being pretentious?

"Yes, yes. I know..."

I mean, when this goes into print it can appear possibly tongue in cheek or possibly pretentious or...

"Yes, I know."

You are, therefore, aware of this?

"I actually pre-censor the things that I say because I'm quite aware of the things I would think if I read them being said by anyone else. But if you trust someone you'll trust the things they say and you'll find what they meant to say even if they said it badly.

"That's the way Robert Wyatt listens to records - he's amazing, you know. He is incredible. I was down there the day he was doing NME singles or whatever with a fresh mind on each one, you know. He'd say 'That's a lovely guitar sound' and I'd think 'What a shitty record'.

He'll read interviews that I'll regard as totally stupid or pretentious and he'll say 'Oh obviously what he meant to say was this but he didn't quite say it right'. So it's a question of making allowances."

Alright. One last point. There has been a little matter of Brian Eno having a certain amount of success in the States. Indeed, in comparison with that of the band from which he emerged, Eno's success has been almost gargantuan. So, how does one feel aboul it then, Brian?

"I feel quite confused about it actually."

Here Come The Warm Jets reached number 92 in the "Billboard" charts - the ones that NME don't use - and in the "Cashbox" charts - which NME does use - the album reached 113. Only another 83 places and it would have been listed in this paper. Who on earth is buying your records in the States, Eno?

"Oh, it's being sold in funny places. I mean, apart from where you'd expect - which is the East and West Coasts. Detroit... which is to be expected really.

"I've got a very big following in Texas... in Dallas and Houston. Texas I can't understand at all. I've sold ever so many albums there. And I can't think who to. I mean, the only people who live there are kind of steak-eating, cattle-breeding oilmen and their sons.

"I suppose it's their sons.

"The only hypotheses I'd ventured about why I'd succeeded and Roxy haven't is the same reason that Monty Python didn't catch on for years - because it's so English and insular in a way that just couldn't work at all in the States.

"And I think possibly Bryan is too English for America at he moment.

"Also my association with Fripp may have helped legitimitize me. It's like saying 'this guy's quite serious because he's worked with Robert Fripp'. That may have made a difference because No Pussyfooting sells very well on import there.

"Particularly in Texas."

Fripp and Eno

No Pussyfooting Around


From Hit Parader, probably in 1974, by Scott Cohen. From the Jeffrey Morgan Archive.


“You think you know what goes on, but you don’t. You go on.” Everyone thought British rock band King Crimson would go on forever, but after five years and eight albums Robert Fripp, a.k.a. King Crimson, has abdicated. “It was just time for King Crimson to come to an end,” Fripp explained as he set out for newer realms.

Robert Fripp is too intellectual and philosophical to “just” do anything. When pressed, Fripp reveals three more complete reasons for the break-up.

“First, it represents a change in the world. It’s a transition from what you might call the old world which is now dead into the new world which is nascent. In the new world the characteristic unit will be small, highly mobile, independent and intelligent.”

Fripp goes on. “Whereas once King Crimson was for the best liberal education I could conceive of for a young man, it is no longer the case. I have found something far more useful.

And thirdly, the energies that are involved in the lifestyle of the band are no longer right for the way I want to live.”

Fripp gave “Atlantic Records” as an example of old world politics and “pure communism as an example of the new world. “Hammond organs and batteries of synthesizers” are examples of old world instruments and “bamboo flutes” are new world instruments. “Howard Hughes and Nixon” are old world people and new world people are “anyone who decides to become that.” “Emerson, Lake and Palmer” is an example of old world music and an example of new world music is “Fripp and Eno”.

Robert Fripp, a small mobile intellectual who looks more like an economics student (which he was) than a rock musician, met another small, mobile intellectual named Eno, formerly of Roxy Music and recently voted fourth best instrumentalist in the world. Fripp met Brian Eno through Bryan Ferry, who had once auditioned for the lead vocal spot in King Crimson. It was more than natural that Fripp, whose first love is the electric guitar, and Eno, whose is the tape recorder, “the only instrument I can handle really well,” should meet, form a duo and record a very innovative album called No Pussyfooting.

Robert Fripp’s manner makes you hesitate to call him Bob. He is short, stocky and bearded. Wearing wirerim glasses, he looks like a real estate broker, a profession he once seriously considered. Eno, whom no one ever calls Brian, is small and delicate with thinning blond hair. In contrast to Fripp, who is solid and earthbound, Eno is vaporous and other-worldly, looking as if at any moment he were about to disappear. Eno’s etherealness makes Fripp look less a pip than he would otherwise. Their minds, however, mesh so tightly that you wonder how their bodies can be so different.

Fripp and Eno are men of ideas who can talk incessantly about practically anything. Both like the idea of deliberately using musicians who aren’t compatible with one another. “By doing that,” Eno explains, you create new frictions. I work from the proposition that the characteristic of art is disorder, not order.”

Both look towards fashion and slang. Eno points out that they are incredibly fast barometers of the rate of cultural change. Fripp’s favorite slang word is “boogalooga,” a word he developed a s a non-specific utterance… “that one could utter with some enthusiasm or write at the bottom of letters when other forms of address may be too specific or too impersonal or too personal.”

Another Fripp favorite is “walnut”, which describes “the state of one’s scrotum when it contracts, like when you come out of a sauna and plunge immediately into icy cold water. In other words, a response which is favorable.”

Neither Fripp nor Eno were born with the qualities which you would expect in a musician. Fripp, who doesn’t sing, played his first song, “Jingle Bells”, on the guitar when he was eleven years old, “at the time when I was tone deaf and had no sense or rhythm, or timing.”

“I asked myself why would a person who is tone deaf and had no sense of rhythm become a musician,” Fripp recalls, “and came to the conclusion that I needed music and music needed me.”

In that sense Fripp is an inspiration to any aspiring musician lacking natural talent. He, however, still can’t dance, which explains why much of his music is so undanceable.

Never being a good enough musician to steal from others probably caused me to develop an original style,” Fripp admits. Some of the musicians he was listening to at the time he formed King Crimson were Bartok, Debussy, Ravel, Hendrix and Clapton. Today he listens mostly to Bartok, Debussy, Ravel and “the sounds of nature, the nature noises.”

Like Fripp, Eno is totally obsessed with technology and philosophy, systems and theories, but is kinky enough to come off interesting rather than boring. He produced the Portsmith Sinfonia, an orchestra whose only requirement is that you come to four rehearsals; any ability to play an instrument is optional. Part of the Sinfonia’s repertoire are such popular classics as Beethoven’s Fifth, the 1812 Overture, the William Tell Overture, the Nutcracker Suite and the Sugar-plum Fairy. The orchestra plays only the parts everyone knows. Their show stopper Thus Spake Zarathustra lasts only two minutes.

In addition, Eno has added to his already incredible tape collection of over two million feet of tape, his wonderful recording of the United States Air Force Starfighter jet. Prior to his first Island Records album Here Come The Warm Jets, he was a member of Roxy Music until he was asked to leave when he started to get too much attention from f\ns and critics.

No Pussyfooting is the result of the Fripp-Eno collaboration. The title of the album is not the best title for the music. “The Heavenly Music Corporation” on side one and “Swastika Girls” on side two aren’t the best titles either because neither tells you what the music is really about. But the album jacket does. On the cover is a color photograph of Fripp and Eno posing in a cubicle lined with mirrors, The mirrors endlessly reflect of both similar and varied sounds which are repeated over and over, creating a mysterious hypnotic drone that goes on into infinity. The album was recorded with only two tracks, a Gibson Les Paul guitar with the Fripp Pedalboard and Frizzbox. Eno worked on two modified Revox A77 tape recorders, with the guitar going through the Revox and into the other, building up a tape loop effect that sounds like fifty guitars.

Originally Fripp wanted the “The Heavenly Music Corporation”, which is perfect for meditating, to be entitled “The Transcendental Music Corporation”, but Eno was afraid people would think they were serious and nix it.

“Eno, while walking towards the studio on the night of the mix,” recalls Fripp, “saw upon the pavement a piece of paper from some magazine with the headline ‘Swastika Girls’ on it. On it were these naked girls with swastika emblems on their sleeves. On the back was this maiden in bondage… Eno, having some interest in bondage, thought this appropriate. Since he left side one to me I left side two to him.”

No Pussyfooting came from the slogan Fripp had written on a piece of paper and planted on the mixer in the studio the night the record was being recorded. “No Pussyfooting is the best thing I’ve ever done,” Fripp remarked triumphantly. Unfortunately the album, which was released in England almost a year ago, probably won’t be released in America because Atlantic Records fears it won’t be supported here.

Will Fripp and Eno tour? Fripp has no idea. “It wouldn’t be touring in the normal sense of the word. It depends upon who wants us and not too many people will.”

Considering their intellectual approach to music, they would be more likely to perform in an art gallery or museum situation than a concert hall. “In a small concert hall or a large lecture hall,” Fripp thinks, “with no more than four or five hundred people.”

Outside of touring, both Fripp and Eno are open to offers for production work, which fits into their definition of being mobile and independent. Their names are in the phone book and they welcome callers: Fripp is also available for guitar lessons.

“For some time I’ve been pondering the creation of a new guitar technique which will cause a change in the personality of the person going through the discipline.

“In learning technique, the person will be put under enough stress to force him to develop emotionally and mentally, and these feelings involved will change his personality.”

At the same time Fripp is working at developing techniques for better living. “I asked myself the basic question, ‘Do you want to live,’ and as soon as I answered that the rest came easy.” He is working at becoming a small, highly mobile, independent, intelligent unit, fully prepared for the new world.

"They've got it all," Garth Hudson said to me almost 20 years ago, when bootlegs collecting more than a hundred Basement Tapes performances were circulating. I was writing a book on the sessions; we were in his storage space in upstate New York, near Woodstock, going through stashes of cassettes. For the afternoon gatherings that took place between the spring of 1967 and as late as the first month or so of 1968, in makeshift studios in various locations – really not much more than instruments, microphones and a tape recorder in Bob Dylan's house, then in the basement of the house Richard Manuel, Rick Danko and Hudson were renting ("a clubhouse," Danko called it), which they named Big Pink; finally in one or two other spots after the three decamped – Hudson had been the engineer. He would know if anyone did. I took him at his word.

But there was a lot more. Of the 140 tracks of The Basement Tapes Complete (including two hidden tracks on the sixth and last disc of the set), counting two hilarious breakdowns that on bootlegs were mere fragments, there are 33 numbers that have never been heard before.

These are the leavings of people working in the dark. There are no formal masterpieces. There is nothing like the opening moment of "This Wheel's on Fire," with Dylan waiting as a minor chord comes down, opening the door to a hall of shame, rage and forgiveness wrapped in a sardonic curse. The unheard tracks remove the mystique of the basement sessions – the mystique generated by the prophecies of "I Shall Be Released," "Tears of Rage" or "I'm Not There," and by the gnomic comedies of "Lo and Behold!," "Crash on the Levee," "Yea! Heavy and a Bottle of Bread," "Clothes Line Saga," "Please Mrs. Henry," "Tiny Montgomery" and "Million Dollar Bash" – and replace it with evidence of ordinary, everyday activity, pure termite art. With a laughing cover of Hank Williams' version of "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It" shot up with a scream on only the second number of the whole new set, on through a dozen or so half-formed songs such as "Any Time," "Jelly Bean" or "She's on My Mind Again" that take it to its end, any hint of the Voice of a Generation, Sage of the Age, is definitively done away with. 

You hear Dylan edging his way into the Fleetwoods' 1959 "Mr. Blue." Behind him, Danko or Manuel guffaws, or burps, to show how dumb the thing is, but Dylan is interested – he's singing to find out why he still likes the song. As on the cover of the Rays' 1957 "Silhouettes," which starts out as a goof and ends with Dylan, Robbie Robertson, Manuel and Danko screaming "Silhouettes!" at one another as if they've just discovered the meaning of life, the basement turns into Robert Zimmerman's upstairs bedroom in Hibbing, Minnesota, in 1958, where he and his guitarist friend John Bucklen would work up the likes of the Hollywood Flames' "Buzz Buzz Buzz" for their high school talent show. The same feeling is there in the newly complete "Bourbon Street," with a drunken strip-joint band without a strip joint trying to get drinks by playing a song it can't even begin to remember. "Ah, play it pretty now, boys," Dylan says, as Danko answers with the most painful trombone screeches in New Orleans memory. "Oh, sounds marvelous!" Dylan responds, and it does.

There is far more from corners like those, and a trio of what were already Dylan standards: "Blowin' in the Wind" as a grinding blues, played out over more than six minutes, as if to discover a world in the song that wasn't obvious in 1963; "One Too Many Mornings," with Manuel taking the first verse, making you wish he'd taken it all; and "It Ain't Me, Babe," which here swirls like Christine McVie's "Over My Head." It's a performance that makes it clear that for Dylan this song was never finished, that the situation it describes can never be resolved – or, at the least, that the song can't resolve it, which is why, whenever Dylan performs it, it sounds both new and as if he didn't write it all, as if the first lines he took from John Jacob Niles' 1930 "Go 'Way From My Window" both wrote the whole song for him and took it away.

The heart of the unheard music is in what sound less like songs than song mines: people digging for songs. "[In] the unconscious state of mind, you get the rhymes first and then see if you can make sense in another kind of way," Dylan said in 1992. "You can still stay in the unconscious frame of mind to pull it off, which is the state of mind you have to be in anyway." He went on to talk about how a line like "The enemy I see wears a cloak of decency," from his own "Slow Train Coming" – "an intellectual line," he called it – "could be a lie." But lines that come without purpose, a mind speaking as if it's merely breathing, can't lie. If, as a character in Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game says, "What is truly dreadful is that everyone has his reasons," here there is no he, and there are no reasons.

That's what you can hear on Discs Five and Six of The Basement Tapes Complete, the latter where the recordings with the worst sound are brought together, and the murk creates its own mystique. What you catch is an exclamation, a phrase seeking a verse, brief snatches that offer a glimpse of a whole life. "If I've lost everything," says the singer in "Wild Wolf," a song that starts in the middle of the ruin of a life, an old man speaking, "yellowed teeth" dropping "one by one in the gutters of the West," in Jack Kerouac's words from On the Road, "but I—" the knowledge, the authority that Dylan finds in the words make this moment as indelible as anything here. The tone is despairing, the spectral melody cuts back against itself, and the song seems to stop, waiting for the thoughts in the singer's head to catch up with the slow but forward movement of the music. On "That's the Breaks," the singing is hard, extreme, the Blue Sky Boys' "The Sunny Side of Life" turned inside out – an old, common song that's gone wrong, that took the wrong road: "That's the breaks/On the other side of life." This might be the deepest mine here, where at the end of a tunnel John Henry finds the alchemist's cave where folk songs are made and found.

This feeling is strongest not in one of Dylan's own songs, but in two performances of "Ain't No More Cane," a Texas chain-gang song probably first recorded by Lead Belly. Dylan and the rest feel their way into the piece, stumbling into it, as if they're still shackled. "Shoulda been on the river in nineteen and ten" – when Dylan sang the song in the Gaslight Cafe in New York in 1962, it was so phony, so patently blackface, it was like a postcard. It would take years for him to disappear into the song, and now he has, and so have the rest. Here there is no Bob Dylan, no band, no basement. They're old men looking back, stunned that they survived, if they have, if they're not ghosts. "Shoulda been on the river in nineteen and four/They found a dead body in every single door." The traditional line is "at every turn row" – men and women worked to death. But here it's pure murder: bodies delivered like mail. Why? How? Do you have to ask? Does it matter? I was there, I saw it, my flesh still crawls at the thought of it, thank your God you weren't on that river, that you never heard of it. The singer is singing not out of anger but in regret, for what he's lost: He was on the river in nineteen and four, and he never felt more alive than when he passed those bodies and could prove to himself he wasn't one of them, because he could take one more step, a step you can feel, as the singers take them.

To find the song inside the song: Is this the trance Bob Dylan was talking about, that unconscious mind? Yes, and here – in "2 Dollars and 99 Cents," "Down by the Station," "Northern Claim," "Pretty Mary" – that's the treasure of the unheard Basement Tapes. Or, as Dylan says at the end of "Love Is Only Mine," the last of the unheard songs in this set: "OK – what key haven't we played in yet?"

Berkeley celebrated its one hundredth anniversary as an independent city the week of April 1st, and typically, the only one of the many centennial events to receive any coverage in the media was the most obvious: a free "Sixties Rock Concert." Less easy to pin down was the county-fair-style carnival at Peoples' Park – that half-block of land won in May of 1969, but not until one man had lost his life, another his eyesight, and (since, after the first day of fighting, Berkeley was occupied by the National Guard) the city its last vestiges of sovereignty. A rented, overnight affair, the carnival came complete with Ferris wheel, bumper cars, shooting gallery and fun house; several yards of grass had been crushed to make room for the midway. It was very incongruous, given the history that was, supposedly, at issue; a lone park volunteer, weeding shrubs a hundred feet from the crowds, did his best to seem indifferent. Just down the street, at the corner of Haste and Dwight – a corner that has likely seen more tear gas than any in the United States – you could follow that history in a wall mural, "A Peoples' History of Telegraph Avenue" (covering the years 1964-1970, it was completed in 1976), and discover why some of us cannot walk past the park, or Moe's Bookstore, or any number of campus battlegrounds that are now merely buildings, without feeling chased by our own ghosts.

Settled by Anglos shortly after the beginning of the Gold Rush, Berkeley is not old as California towns go; that I've lived in the city for one-seventh of its official tenure, or that my house has stood for more than half of it, means that history should be within easy reach. On the other hand, so much history was made in Berkeley, from the Free Speech Movement to the last bitter demonstrations over the invasion of Cambodia, that everything else that has happened here – be it the opening of the University, the founding of the city itself, or the brilliant flowering of Berkeley architecture at the hands of Bernard Maybeck, John Galen Howard and Julia Morgan during the first third of this century – seems more than a little spectral. At least for a time, the Berkeley of the Sixties utterly replaced the past, blotted it out. But that time too is now the past, and since Berkeley is now more than "where I live," it's where I come from, I took its one hundredth birthday as an opportunity to learn more about the place: to come from more.

The centennial event I liked best was the parade, held in the business district (the last parade I'd attended there took place the day after the Peoples' Park shootings, in the teeth of the Guard; it was bigger) on Saturday, April 8th. If ever there was an affair the theme of which was "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," this was it. The reviewing stand was an affirmative-action Utopia – it was balanced perfectly between old and young, men and women, whites, Chicanos, blacks and Orientals – and the parade followed suit. Anyone could march. There were bands (Berkeley High, the University), horseback riders, lots of vintage cars, classes of schoolchildren, but there were also families pushing strollers, a full-dress contingent of black cowboys and cowgirls, a huge group of Hare Krishna shouters, a dozen men from the American Legion, Ronald MacDonald (a big fight was waged last year to keep him out of town), a steel-eyed black man with a homemade T-shirt that read "Bikers Are Human Too," and a fellow dressed as an eighteenth-century divine. That was Bishop Berkeley, from whom the town took its name. Berkeley was a philosopher; it was his belief that the material world existed only in the perceptions of the beholder, which is as good a premise for a city that also calls itself the Athens of the West as any other.

What I liked about the parade was the idea that Berkeley was a city in which – to which – anyone could belong: an idea much richer than "tolerance." Everyone seemed appropriate in the parade, and that suggested a city that by some magic (attributable in part to the interplay between the town's architectural and natural beauty, the University as a continual source of novelty, and the hundred-year-old antagonism between the working-class residents of the flatlands and the professional-class residents of the hills) has resisted taking final shape. The parade said that Berkeley was still a place to be made; that it could be founded over and over again – just as it had been founded in municipal and commercial terms in 1878, in aesthetic terms by architects and intellectuals in the Teens and Twenties, and in political terms by students in the Sixties. There was, the parade announced, room for anyone willing to persevere long enough to be accepted and valued as part of the daily reality of the place, be he or she Hubert Lindsay, the campus evangelist who for years railed with great good humor at the sinfulness of student life; John DeBonis, the inescapable rightwing city councilman who in the Sixties drove his opponents mad with rage; the woman who has walked down Telegraph Avenue blowing bubbles for more than ten years; or the waiter at my favorite Mexican restaurant, who still refuses to admit he recognizes me even though I have eaten at his table for fifteen years and have never changed my order once. Stagnant as Berkeley often seems to be – and what place would not, after what this place has been through? – I was sure, watching the parade with a grin, that the city had surprises left.

That night, at a party, I talked with a professor whose course in political theory I'd taken during the wondrously exuberant semester that followed the Free Speech Movement – a time when, with no fakery at all, the ideas of Plato, Rousseau, or whoever else one might be reading were linked with astonishing power to the political choices we considered every day. "I almost quit after that," the professor had told me once. "I knew it could never be that good again."

This night he was talking about a city and a college at which he had just spent a term as a visiting teacher. "It's a meanspirited place," he said – and he described a community open only in its contempt for those deemed not worthy of membership in it: a college unashamedly anti-Semitic, a town that held its shape to the degree that it could keep its Chicanos and Indians outside its limits. A place, in other words, where repression was not even an embarrassment, but indeed the basis of public life.

Given my state of mind, what I heard described was a city that was in every obvious way not Berkeley – and whether it was not Berkeley because Berkeley is better, or in some sophisticated, hypocritical way worse, I didn't much care. It's a question not simply of where you are at home, but of where you choose to make a home.

The day after the parade I went to the exhibit on Berkeley history. There were panels about Berkeley's long-vanished Indians, about the aesthetes of the Twenties: one woman had Bernard Maybeck build her an insane Greek temple and was photographed in the manner of Isadora Duncan. Then I watched a slide show. Half of it concerned old Berkeley: the first businesses, the ruinous fire of 1923 that burnt a path right down to the foot of Euclid Avenue. The second half was about Peoples' Park; I saw, as Berkeley's official history, slides of what, almost ten years before, I had seen in the flesh. I remembered taking the class I was then teaching to watch the police erect a fence around the park lot; I remembered thinking it odd that the cops were wearing flak jackets. I remembered how my wife, then pregnant, had a short time later walked down Telegraph Avenue, trying not to look at the county sheriffs who were aiming shotguns at her from the windows of their cars; I remembered standing in my bank when a man rushed in to announce that people were being shot down in the streets only blocks away; and I remembered, in a flash of faces and explosions, the fights that followed. What I learned, watching the slides, was that, as is not true everywhere in this country, the history of the place where I live was history that by the plain fact of presence I had been allowed to help make.

Like all places, Berkeley offers a special kind of oppression and a special kind of freedom: here, the oppression of those too sure they know what's good for others, and the freedom always to start over from what looks like a beginning. The blazingly personal houses left by the architects speak for that no less than the photos of Peoples' Park – speak for the reality that in Berkeley anyone can be a founder, can leave a mark. In doing so, one does more than become part of a history that someone else will collect in the future; one joins a history and accepts the burden of continuing it.


Roxy Music has not gone disco.

Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either.

Manifesto is the band's first release since it broke up after the obligatory lousy live LP in 1976. Though far more interesting than most such sets (Who can forget the Byrds' numbing 1973 reunion album? Who can remember a thing that was on it?), it offers only embellishments on the Roxy sound and story. The new record is a lovely footnote, but it can lead nowhere.

That sound and story deserve a footnote: both were among the most glorious and eccentric of the Seventies. The band — especially guitarist Phil Manzanera, saxophonist Andy Mackay, drummer Paul Thompson and Eddie Jobson (missing on Manifesto) on synthesizer — produced railing hard rock or smoky dreamscapes; always the musicians played with precision, individuality and intelligence. Bryan Ferry sang as if he never noticed there was anyone behind him, so lost was he in a strange, abandoned theater of heartbreak, desperate longings and general post-Great Warangst. Roxy Music made it all funny and stirring at the same time, storming through Stranded and finishing up with Siren. Siren was perhaps the most perfectly crafted album of the decade, as well as Ferry's heart-on-his-sleeve break with the cynicism of the confused hustler's persona he'd carried so long.

Manifesto is bits and pieces of all that. The songs ending each side fade out with real grace and leave you hanging, wanting more — drenched in a romance out of reach. "Still Falls the Rain" is a quiet, forgiving ballad in the purest Roxy style, full of tiny touches that occur only once, teasing you to wait for a repetition that never comes. Manzanera's four little notes, almost buried in the distant band sound, underline Ferry's emotion: those notes are as surprising as anything Manzanera's ever played, and they carry as strong an echo. "Cry, Cry, Cry" is a horrible piece of old-fashioned soul, and yet, as "Spin Me Round" takes over and closes out the set, you forget all about the mistakes and drift away, just like Dobie Gray said you could.

So the record has its moments — moments few bands even know about — but as with the brazenly (and meaninglessly) titled "Manifesto," they add up to little. Ferry announces he's for the guy "who'd rather die than be tied down"; he's rarely traded on such banality, and he mouths the lyrics as if he hopes no one will hear them. The sound may be alive, but the story is almost silent.

It's not that Ferry has given it up. He began making solo albums long before Roxy called it a day — starting with his outrageous collection of oldies covers, These Foolish Things, and continuing through last year's astonishing The Bride Stripped Bare — and on those LPs, the tale of a man struggling to find himself behind his mask, and a lover behind hers, goes on. It's a tale couched in melodrama but driven by terror and compassion: what it has is the intensity Manifesto never reaches for.

Manifesto betrays no pandering to nostalgia, but on it, Bryan Ferry looks back to old loves, remembers fondly, accepts what he cannot have: he feels safe from the hope those loves stood for, from the dangers of the lust they summoned. As in "Still Falls the Rain," this is a shining conception, and the people this state of mind calls up come to life in the music. But like Manifesto itself, such a respite can be no more than a respite, a holding action. The struggle is merely out of sight, and on Ferry's own records, I'd imagine, that struggle will soon be back on center stage.

New Musical Express recently carried an item noting that Neil Young has been awarded a gold record solely for the number of test pressings he'd racked up for Comes a Time — well, you never know. As with so many other Young productions, Comes a Time was less released than drawn out. I seem to remember hearing radio ads for it last spring, though since no one was sure of the title at that time (Gone with the Wind was on the boards for a while), the snatches of song were simply announced as from "The New Neil Young Album." I lost count of how many times Young was reported to have rejected the vinyl Warner Communications had in mind, or how many changes the cover art suffered before Young settled on an ordinary Huckleberry Neil photo for the front and a paste-on sheet of titles for the back. And that's not even to mention what the four producers (including Young) and ten engineers presumably went through. It must have taken forever to get the sound unbalanced properly.

All of which insures a certain disappointment — in this case — because Comes a Time is neither a knockout punch like last year's American Stars 'n Bars nor a wildly idiosyncratic, cracked triumph/disaster like Zuma or On the Beach. A restrained and modest set of love songs that traces a long affair from first light to final regrets, Comes a Time is an unsurprisingly "personal," "sensitive" singer/songwriter's offering, more like After the Gold Rush or Harvest than any other Young LP — though without most of the cloying innocence of those two enormously popular records. It's a pleasing, clearly commercial piece of work that's defended from slickness by Young's insistence on playing out of tune, skewing the levels of the vocals (Nicolette Larson is sometimes given a true screech) and singing without much affectation. Comes a Time isn't deep, it's not threatening, and Young can't have intended it to be: he can dive deeply and make his threats stick when he wants to. Rather, the album is meant to be straight and honest — folkish, like Young's small-club "World Tour" at the Boarding House in San Francisco last May. The clatter and clash of Young's best music (from "Cowgirl in the Sand" to "Like a Hurricane"), the jagged, rearing emotion that explodes even out of the messy rehearsal tapes for "Alabama" and "Words" (released on Journey through the Past) is missing, or muted.

The music doesn't press; it's comfortable. There's a moment halfway through "Look Out for My Love" when the guitar turns into a fiddle and the passion rises like an omen — but it's a moment, no more. "In the field of opportunity/It's plowing time again" are fabulous lines — I laughed out loud when a friend quoted them to me a few months ago — but here Young has taken the glee out of them. Their ribaldry is muffled by a hokey hillbilly arrangement, and what should have been an outrageous double-entendre just sounds contrived when Young refuses to stick to his musical concept, singing "plowing" instead of the "plowin'" his country mode is begging for. The LP includes a traditional amount of traditional Neil Young sappiness, as when he wonders why the world spinning 'round doesn't make the trees fall down.

Comes a Time comes across despite all this, partly because we know Young never has and never will make a record without glaring flaws (think of the endless "Will to Love" on American Stars 'n Bars), and because the dose of personality it contains is bracing. Young long ago gave up trying to sing "right"; his last real attempt to do so (Neil Young, his first solo album) is made up of better songs than is Comes a Time. But it sounds stiff and emotionally compromised by comparison. Here, even on the more standard compositions, his voice wars with the facelessness of the material: it breaks, surges, drops back on itself. If at first the new LP seems all smooth surface, Young's voice cracks that surface and carries you through the tale he's telling, even warning at one point that he'll soon be boring you, yet never making good on that promise. When Neil Young closes out his story with Ian Tyson's "Four Strong Winds," there's a real sense of time having passed, of choices made and chances blown: the wistfulness of Tyson's song doesn't survive Young's refusal to cater to its prettiness.

It's still pretty — Meat Loaf could sing "Four Strong Winds" and it'd probably still be pretty — but it's also knocked off the pedestal that has always been part of the tune's package. Young sings as if he's talking to a real person, not as if he's engaging in a precious reverie with himself. The unpleasantness — i.e., the utter conventionality — of the composition falls away, and the pressed-flower poetry of the chorus dissolves into something like plain talk. I found myself thinking of Bob Dylan's "If You See Her, Say Hello" and "Shelter from the Storm."

For all its clichés, though, "Four Strong Winds" stands out here because it's a carefully crafted song, crafted to stick in your mind, and Young's own songs on Comes a Time aren't and don't. They're incidents on an album and they work as such, but dropped onto other records, they'd be forgettable. (Save for "Field of Opportunity," which, despite all I've said against its performance, is just too neat an idea to fade from memory.) There's a dogged retreat from musical intensity on the new disc: nothing to match the chorus of "Helpless" or the shivery hesitations of "Tonight's the Night." The terrible drama of Young's guitar — a quality, based in the ancient modal figures of mountain music, that always suggests dread and courage — is present only in snatches and distant echoes. It's those echoes that save Comes a Time from the little-boy-lost conceits of Harvest and After the Gold Rush, and the fact that they're no more than echoes may make this LP just as commercially potent. If so, commercial success will continue to give Neil Young the freedom he has fought for, won, used and stood up to better than any rock & roller of the decade.

Junking covers and test pressings, suggesting new art and then junking that too, ending up with out-of-phase singing and worse, is all part of that freedom — a way of testing it, pushing it, seeing what one can get away with in the corporate world on which Young's music rests. Though Comes a Time seems like a move toward easy acceptance and the act of a man who knows it's time to tidy up his economic base, those unbalanced vocals and flat notes might be seen as the flip side of fiddling with the record company: a way of testing the audience, keeping it just a bit off guard — reminding those who'll love Comes a Time because it can be mooned over that something a lot rougher, who knows what, is certain to follow.

These days you might hear Dusty Springfield's 1964 "I Only Want to Be With You" as the theme song for Arliss, Robert Wuhl's HBO sports-agent comedy. But in 1969 she plowed a furrow you can still find: As a white English pop singer, she went south, and with the A team of Atlantic Records — producers Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin — and a five-man Memphis band led by guitarist Reggie Young and bassist Tommy Cogbill, she cut a real soul album. A real drifting, cool, smart, sexually distracted soul album by a singer who got grease all over her hands with one song and primly wiped them off before heading into the next one.

The record still sounds uniquely classy and knowing, but today Springfield's all but total dependence on the quality of her material — by songwriters ranging from the then little-known Randy Newman ("I Don't Want to Hear It Anymore," "Just One Smile") to schlock merchants Alan and Marilyn Bergman ("The Windmills of Your Mind") — is also evident. Tune by tune, the album rises up, then dies, then comes back to life again. Springfield comes off the evaporating Burt Bacharach-Hal David number "In the Land of Make Believe" as if she's never heard of Memphis, let alone already made the place over with "Son of a Preacher Man" — and then the first, saddening steps of Gerry Goffin and Carole King's "No Easy Way Down" are taken and you know this woman is up to the toughest song anyone in town can throw at her. It was the cream puffs that knocked her down.

Named for a Coney Island street where Woody Guthrie lived in the late Forties and early Fifties, Mermaid Avenue is a collection of recently discovered Guthrie lyrics now set to music for the first time. It's also nothing that the previous work of those involved could have led anyone to expect.

Born in 1912, shaped by the 1930s, recording mostly in the 1940s, the shadow self of a young Bob Dylan in the early 1960s and dead in 1967, Woody Guthrie made his mark as a left-wing version of the professional American. If you listen to him now — homing in on such all-American folk passwords as "Stackolee" and "When That Great Ship Went Down" or on Guthrie's own compositions, from "This Land Is Your Land" to "Farmer-Labor Train" — he can sound very far away. His singing ranges from witty to ghostly to (too often) dull. Flights of craft and inspiration in his words and melodies can be dragged down to earth by the freight they carry: the perfectly weighed and measured details of saying the politically proper thing in the politically proper way.

You can hear a similar imprisonment in the careers of Billy Bragg and Wilco. Since 1983, Bragg has combined a heavy East End London accent, often the naked sound of his own electric guitar, and a political sensibility that owes more to the 1930s than to any time since. He has left behind "Levi Stubbs' Tears," which still feels like an open wound, and a slew of pieces testifying mostly to the fact that his heart is in the right place, even if he wears it on his sleeve. Singer Jeff Tweedy stepped out with Uncle Tupelo in 1990; there or in Wilco, with guitarist and keyboard player Jay Bennett, drummer Ken Coomer and bassist John Stirratt, he has sung more at his red-dirt revisions of the oldest folk and country airs than from inside them. He has seemed far more sure of himself singing other people's songs, even such seemingly uncoverable eruptions of the American Gothic as Richard "Rabbit" Brown's "James Alley Blues" or Dock Boggs' "Sugar Baby," both of which were originally recorded around seventy years ago. It's as if Tweedy loves the old American music too much to trust his own.

Thus it's the best shock of the year to find Mermaid Avenue opening with a couple of sailors tripping over each other in search of booze and pussy — there being no more proper way to put it. "Walked up to a big old building/I won't say which building," Bragg says happily. "Walked up the stairs/Not to say which stairs" — and just like that, with a crowd of smelly drunks shouting Bragg through the choruses, Guthrle's lyric sheet for "Walt Whitman's Niece" turns into some seemingly fated tangle of "Gloria," Last Exit to Brooklyn and Beach Boys' Party! as performed by the Three Stooges. For the rest of the disc, making a better world is inseparable from making a better night, and the historical treasure of Guthrie's found lyrics yields to the melodies and arrangements that Bragg and Wilco use to bring them to life.

Hard or even impossible to place, those melodies, from just below the surface of the American pop tradition or from the true depths of the British folk tradition, float Guthrie's screeds, stories and musings off into a realm where he is freed from his legend — into a realm where the people now singing his songs are freed from respect for it. The songs seemingly move of their own accord, and the record becomes unstable. The number that you know is the best piece here isn't the one with the tune you can't get out of your head — and which one that might be changes every other day. From Tweedy's dry-as-dust vocal on "Hesitating Beauty" — a seduction song named for Guthrie's daughter — to the rousing sing-along Bragg makes of "I Guess I Planted," Guthrie's summation of his life's work, the forgotten or untold stories in the songs become a new story, and it all comes to verge with "Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key."

A young man gets a young woman to crawl into a hollow tree with him; promising that "there ain't nobody that can sing like me," he gets her to take off her shirt; years and years later, he looks back and smiles. The melody that guides this slowly told, perfectly written tale convinces you that even if the man grew up to rob widows and orphans, he has lived a blessed life. Natalie Merchant, coming in behind Bragg's lead, opens up the song, making it the woman's as much as the man's; Eliza Carthy's fiddle, seemingly waiting in the melody long before it chooses to take up Guthrie's words, makes the story being told feel as old as the stories told in the oldest folk songs, in "The Coo Coo" or "The House Carpenter." As Bragg and Wilco perform it, the number is also no more than what it is: an old man's grin.

Mermaid Avenue is not the place to discover Woody Guthrie; it may not even be the place to discover Wilco or Billy Bragg. The record is a thing in itself, perhaps standing outside the stories told by the careers of its principals, as if already looking back on all their failures, saying this time you got it right.

Herewith, two rock & roll singers distinguished by their almost total disregard for the music and marketing strategies of their contemporaries. One is as established as such a performer can be and, it seems, is settling into an acceptance of the refusal of the great audience to accept him; the other is new on the scene and, just possibly, a star for these times. God knows what other times he might be a star for.

Little Criminals offers all the minor charms of Randy Newman's music and none of the major ones: craft without vision, which means the craft is uninspired. The songs aren't even funny; they lack bite. Neither Newman's performances nor his words carry the conviction needed to put across his situational ironies, gnomic narratives and skewed moral tales; in fact, this time around, the ironies, morals and narratives seem too slight to elicit conviction. Newman can't put all of himself into a song as vague as "I'll Be Home" or as pallid as "In Germany before the War," because the songs contain so little of him. One can go back over Newman's work and find any number of tunes that cry out to be heard, whether or not very many people actually did hear them; there isn't a song on Little Criminals that sounds as if it needed to be sung. Newman has always been ambivalent about his ambitions, aesthetic as well as commercial, but this is the first time his ambivalence has gotten the better of him.

What Little Criminals showcases are not songs, but arrangements, plus the contributions of various members of the Eagles. The arrangements are good — particularly with "Jolly Coppers" and "Baltimore," not to mention the dreamy bandbox sound on "Sigmund Freud's Impersonation of Albert Einstein in America" — but they're good in limbo; the music fails to bring out Newman's lyrics and his singing, because both are so limited. "Baltimore" is clearly meant as a statement about The Death of an American City, but there isn't a detail in it that has anything to do with Baltimore. Where is Newman's eye for the specific, the eye that picked out the little fat man next to Calvin Coolidge in "Louisianna 1927"?

Some of the new songs never rise above the level of the tame joke, but "Sigmund Freud's Impersonation of Albert Einstein in America" aims halfheartedly at serious satire. The song was meant for the soundtrack of Robert Altman's now-shelved movie version of Ragtime; the worst that can be said of it is that it fully matches the cheap sarcasm of E.L. Doctorow's book, and the best that can be said of it is that there is a touching beauty to the way Randy sings the opening lines: "The world of science is my game/And Albert Einstein is my name." The problem is that Newman is no longer taking on the personae of his characters, and so, beyond that first turn of phrase, "Freud" and "Einstein" evaporate. Newman simply has nothing to say — except that America is not all it's cracked up to be, a notion unlikely to stagger even the unwary.

Though Newman has occasionally pandered to his cult of fans — congratulating them for being hipper than the rest of the rock & roll crowd — he has most often dealt with his lack of a broad range of listeners by offering the big, shapeless pop audience work that is better than it demands and tougher than it can handle. He has challenged that audience to respond to his work, and thus challenged himself, as a born minority artist, to reach that audience without conceding anything to that audience's weaknesses. With Little Criminals, one can still say he is making no concessions, but that is because he seems to have none to make.

Elvis Costello's debut album brought home to me just how timid Little Criminals really is. Costello's best songs are anything but timid, but they're as intelligent as some of Newman's finest, as endearingly elusive in their meanings, and funny in the same bitter, self-deprecating manner. They are also, like Newman's signature songs, very weird. Costello, a twenty-two-year-old excomputer operator who grew up in Liverpool and now looks like an underfed, misanthropic Buddy Holly, is proof that not only are things quite strange in England today, they are capable of getting a lot stranger.

It should be said out front that there is a strictly musical difference, among many others, between Newman and Costello. Newman draws on ragtime, blues, Kurt Weill and movie music to orchestrate his lazy drawl; Costello, who in his quieter moments sounds something like Nick Lowe, who produced My Aim Is True, aims for tricky, infectious pop stylings, or he rocks out. In his less quiet moments he often sings as if there's a gun at his back, and he talks like a true pop obsessive. His songs, he told Nick Kent of New Musical Express, are motivated solely by "revenge and guilt"; he hates the record business so much he has begun to keep a blacklist against the day he seizes power. He wants to die before he gets old: "I'd rather kill myself .... I'm not going to be around to witness my artistic decline."

There is genius in the wording of that last sentence, and it has found its way into Costello's songs — which tend to the neurotic, though never at the expense of finding the right place for the right lick. His most striking number might be "Less than Zero," which Costello wrote after watching the BBC-TV rehabilitation of Oswald Mosley, in the Thirties the leader of Britain's pro-Hitler Union of Fascists and today a hero of the racist, neo-Fascist National Front.

The message is plain: if there's a place in British society for people like Mosley, then there is no place for Costello — none that he wants, anyway. This song, particularly to American listeners, is obscure, but given the violent behavior of groups like the National Front in Britain today, it is brave, and must be noted. Much more accessible are such edgy rockers as "Welcome to the Working Week" and "I'm Not Angry," or "Alison," a nasty, very sexy ballad. As for "Mystery Dance," imagine an arrangement based somewhere in the vicinity of Little Richard's "Ready Teddy," but supercharged with double-time, explosive dead stops, a band (Clover, a Bay Area group relocated in the U.K.) that plays as if its life depended on it, a mean, desperate vocal, and piano that might as well be swept by Jerry Lee Lewis — all behind these lines, as clean as anything by Chuck Berry, but so much more perverse:

Well remember when the lights went out
And I was trying to make it look like it was never in doubt
She thought that I knew and I thought that she knew
Both of us were willing
But we didn't know how to DO IT
Why don't you tell me 'bout the Mystery Dance....

By the time Costello crashes out of one of the better guitar solos of our day and into the third verse, which is about masturbation — there is a very insistent declension in this song — one realizes that the possibilities of present-day rockabilly have nothing to do with the flaccid revivals of a poser like Robert Gordon. "Mystery Dance," like so much of Costello's album, does not refer back to classic rock: it is classic rock.

My Aim Is True (the title is a line from "Alison") is in the Top Twenty in Britain; it is likely to go higher, as Costello recently managed to get himself busted for taking his electric guitar into the streets. The LP is already getting airplay on American FM stations, and a tour of sorts is set for late fall. How far Costello can go — especially given the unfortunate timing that surrounds his assumed first name — remains to be seen, but I have a feeling that once he is heard, he is going to shake up a lot of his erstwhile peers and make many musicians whom he would not consider his peers seem quite irrelevant — he has the musical sophistication, which is to say access to the musical credibility, to do that, as, at the moment, the Sex Pistols don't.

I think Costello, like Graham Parker and the best of the British punk bands, has only begun to surprise us. Whether or not he is around to witness his artistic decline, I imagine even that would be worth something — as it would be, of course, with Randy Newman, if it is not already.

In 1977, Elvis Costello emerged in London as one of the unquestioned originals of modern pop music. Just twenty-two when he released his first album, 'My Aim Is True,' he seemed master of every rock & roll move – on record and off. He combined the brains of Randy Newman and the implacability of Bob Dylan, the everyman pathos of Buddy Holly and the uniqueness of John Lennon. Everything was up for grabs in his music: love, money, status, hope, fear and, perhaps most of all, the very notion of control. No punk in terms of craft, he rode the punk wave because he communicated a more authentic bitterness than any punk; his demands on the world were more powerful and thus his rejection of the world when it failed to deliver was more convincing.

In 1982, Elvis Costello remains known almost solely through his music – and the scandalous "Ray Charles" incident, which made the papers across the country and across the water. Aside from a 1981 appearance on Tom Snyder's 'Tomorrow' show, Costello had not sat down for a comprehensive interview with an American journalist until this summer – and no interview has appeared in a U.K. publication since 1977.

With the release of his eighth album, 'Imperial Bedroom,' Costello and his band, the Attractions – Bruce Thomas, bass; Steve Nieve, keyboards; and Pete Thomas, drums – opened an American tour this July 14th at Santa Cruz, California, to a jabbering crowd of surfers and college students. There, he performed his songs, two hours' worth – plus Elvis Presley's 'Little Sister,' his first cover of his namesake. Three nights later, to a bigger, far more various and receptive crowd in Berkeley, Costello performed his view of the world – a show that ripped through the night.

The next day we met for a five-hour conversation. Wearing an unmistakable pair of bright red shoes, Costello was serious about the situation – his first real interview with a national publication – but also very much at ease. We talked about his aversion to journalists; Brecht and Weill; the presence of Hank Williams in 'The Last Picture Show'; the theological dispute between Sam Phillips and Jerry Lee Lewis that preceded the recording of "Great Balls of Fire"; Costello's course of study in high school English ("Second-half-of-the-twentieth-century working-class British literature – 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,' 'The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner,' 'Billy Liar'"); Frank Sinatra's incandescent version of "I Can't Get Started (with You)," from the album 'No One Cares,' especially the unique spoken introduction ("'Each time I chanced to see Franklin D.,'" Costello reminded me,"'he always said, "Hi, buddy" to me'"); Sonny Boy Williamson's "Little Village"; Billie Holiday; Mel Tormé; Charlie Rich; Peter Guralnick's 'Lost Highway'; Kay Kendall; Isabelle Adjani; and –

And, we will need another interview, another time. As for what I have taken from that conversation – what seems, given how little Costello has spoken for print, most fundamental and necessary – I've compressed some passages, left myself out of the dialogue when I did no more than say, "And then . . .," and stitched the result together with narrative. Five years after, one must begin at the beginning.

Declan McManus was born in London in 1955 and grew up there, attending Catholic schools. For his last two years of secondary or high school he moved to Liverpool to live with his mother, by that time divorced from his father, Ross McManus, a big-band singer and solo cabaret performer.

I graduated from secondary school in 1973. It was the first year of 1 million unemployed in England in recent times – in Liverpool, anywhere up north,it was worse. I was very lucky to get a job. I had no ambition to go into further education; I just went out and got the first job I could get. I went along to be a chart corrector, tea boy, clerk – because I wasn't really qualified for anything. I got a job as a computer operator, which happened to be comparatively well paid: about twenty pounds a week. I'd just put tapes on the machines and feed cards in, line up printing machines – all the manual work the computer itself doesn't have arms to do.

Elvis Costello Rocks Amazing Spinning Songbook Set

I had something of an ambition to be a professional musician. I was already playing guitar in high school – playing in folk clubs on my own. I was writing my own songs – dreadful songs, performing them more or less religiously. I didn't think the songs were worth recording – but the only way you get better is to play what you write. Then you have the humiliation of being crushed – if they're obviously insubstantial. If you don't put them over you quickly learn from experience.

I stuck out the first computer job for about six months; at the same time, I got into a group in Liverpool, a sort of folk group – we'd do a few rock 'n' roll tunes, and songs of our own, but we weren't getting anywhere. The Cavern was still there – and that's where I met Nick Lowe, just before I came to London, in '74. He was still with Brinsley Schwarz; it was the autumn of their career. We'd do a few of their numbers in our set; we had a show at a little club, they were playing at the Cavern, and we went along and met in the bar and started chatting. He was in a real proper group that recorded records! That was the first time I'd ever spoken to anybody that was in a group – and his attitude even then has been reflected in the way he's been since. When we've worked together, it's been, "I can't see what's so difficult about it, it's just four chords" – and he'd bang them out. He always had that attitude – it was quite a revelation to me.

What was the beginning of your life as a fan?
My father was with Joe Loss – the English Glenn Miller, I suppose. He was with him from about 1953 to 1968, and then he went solo; his instrument is trumpet but he's a singer. After the years with Joe Loss he went out as a cabaret artist; he does social clubs and nightclubs and cabaret, drives around himself.

The first records I ever owned were "Please Please Me" – and "The Folksinger" by John Leyton. I was at a little bit of an advantage because my father was still with Joe Loss then – he used to get quite a lot of records because they would cover the hits of the day. He'd often have demonstration copies, even acetates; as late as 1966, Northern Songs would still send Beatles acetates out to the orchestras to garner covers for [live] radio play. I've got them at home. As my father was the most versatile of the three Joe Loss band singers, I was fortunate – he got the records and just passed them on to me.

I was just into singles, whatever was on the radio – the Kinks, the Who, Motown. It was exciting . . . I was in the Beatles fan club when I was eleven; I used to buy the magazines. The one kind of music that I didn't like was rock 'n' roll – as a distinct [classic] form. The girl next door loved the Shadows and Cliff Richard – I thought that was really old hat. Someone who lived across the road from my grandmother liked Buddy Holly – I thought that was terribly old-fashioned, I couldn't understand why anybody liked it. It never occurred to me that someone as archaic as Chuck Berry could have written "Roll Over Beethoven" – because I was quite convinced that George Harrison had written it.

The only time it changed, the only time it went a bit peculiar, where it maybe went a bit clandestine, was when I went to live in Liverpool. I was never very taken with pyschedelic music – but my dad went a bit psychedelic around the edges,about 1968. He grew his hair quite long; he used to give me Grateful Dead records, and Surrealistic Pillow. I'd keep them for a couple of weeks, and then sell them at the record exchange and buy Marvin Gaye records. When I went to live in Liverpool I discovered everyone was still into acid rock – and I used to hide my Otis Redding records when friends came around. I didn't want to be out of step. To the age of sixteen it's really crucial that you're in – and I tried hard to like the Grateful Dead or Spirit. I tried to find somebody of that sort that I could like that nobody else did – because everyone would adopt his group, and his group woud be it: someone weird like Captain Beefheart. It's no different now – people trying to outdo each other in extremes. There are people who like X, and there are people who say X are wimps; they like Black Flag.

I actually "saw the light" when I was already playing – coming back to London, seeing a lot of groups, Nick Lowe and the Brinsleys, pub-rock groups. I think you get very earnest when you're about sixteen to eighteen, and everyone at school was listening either to the psychedelic groups or singer/songwriters: it was all very earnest, pouring out your inner soul. In London I discovered that all the music I liked secretly, that I'd been hiding from my friends – that was what was great fun in a bar: Lee Dorsey songs! Suddenly it was all right to like it; that was when I saw the light. There was nothing wrong with it.

In England, now, there's a prejudice against that era, the prepunk era; the bands tend to get ridden down: "Oh, that's just pub rock." I'd much rather any day go and see NRBQ playing in a bar than I would the most illustrious of our punk groups in England, because I don't think they have anything to do with anything. They're horrible – and phony, and dishonest as well.

Who are you talking about?
The Exploited – and the whole Oi! business.

Bands like the Anti-Nowhere League?
Now, the Anti-Nowhere League, I quite like them, because they're just animals: they drive around in a van that says, WE'RE THE ANTI-NOWHERE LEAGUE AND YOU'RE NOT! – I mean, that's great.

The Damned were the best punk group, because there was no art behind them; they were just enjoying themselves. There was no art behind them that I could see. They were just – nasty. I loved them from the start. I liked the Pistols as well – but you could see the concern behind it. It's dishonest to say, "Oh, yes, we were just wild"; they weren't just wild. It was considered and calculated. Very art. The Clash as well.

While all that was going on, I had a little group in London. I'd moved from one computer job to another; it was a total bluff, really, I knew nothing about it, but I knew enough of the jargon. It was ideal: waiting for the machine to do the work, there's a lot of free time for writing and reading. In the evenings we'd try to play rock 'n' roll, R&B numbers, some country songs – a real pub-rock mixture. There was no focus to it; it was aimless. We could get through the usual bar-band repertoire – but I remember Pete Thomas, now the Attractions drummer and then a drummer in a quite successful pub-rock band, Chilli Willy, coming to see us – he was a celebrity to us – and he walked out after about thirty seconds. I think he came to see our worst-ever gig – but with no offense to the guys, we weren't very good.

It was the usual thing – trapped in mediocrity. So I went out on my own again, solo. That's very hard, because there's no real platform for solo singing unless you sing traditional music or recognized blues, doing re-creations – you know how reverent Europeans are.

It was difficult to develop an original style. I have no idea who it was I might have been imitating, whether consciously or unconsciously. I was playing on my own, trying to put my songs across. I suppose I should have had a band behind them – but playing alone did build up an edge. I did the odd show just to keep up, to keep trying to improve the ability to play. You'd soon know if a song was bad if you were dying in a club; you'd have to put more edge on it. Playing on your own, you'd have the tension – you could increase the tension at will, not relying on anybody to pick up the beat.

McManus made a guitar-and-vocal demo and hawked his songs to various record companies. The one that responded was Jake Riviera and Dave Robinson's new Stiff label, emerging in 1976 out of the pub-rock scene and bridging the gap to punk.
On the first demo tape that I sent to Stiff, that brought me the gig, as it were, there were only two or three songs that ended up on My Aim Is True. There were a lot of raw songs – and looking at them now, rather precious songs, with a lot of chords. Showing-off songs. I was very impressed by Randy Newman, and wrote a lot of songs with that ragtime feel. I was very impressed with those funny chord changes that he used to play and I was emulating that on guitar. They came out convoluted; they weren't poppy at all, they had pretensions to a sophistication they didn't have.

Elvis Costello's Best (And Most Curiously Underrated) Album Turns 30

That exactly coincided with punk. But I was working – I didn't have the money to go down to the Roxy and see what the bands were doing: the Clash, the Pistols. I just read about them in Melody Maker and NME the same as anyone else. Joe Public. I was living in the suburbs of London, I couldn't afford to go to clubs uptown. They were open until two o'clock in the morning, I couldn't afford taxis – the tubes are closed just after midnight. All these bands were playing in the middle of the night. I don't know who went to the bloody gigs – I can only guess they were rich people with cars and lots of drugs.

I got up at seven in the morning and so I couldn't go. I was married with a son; I couldn't take the day off. I took enough time playing sick, taking sick time off of my job, just to make My Aim Is True.

Then I started listening to the records that were coming out, because I'd got this snobbish attitude: so little of any worth had come out for a few years. When the first few punk records came out, I suddenly started thinking: "Hang on – this is something a little bit different."

I mean, I spoke with someone the other day who said that when the first Clash album came out, he was outraged. I remember being outraged, and thinking, "If this is what music's going to be like" – I remember Joe Strummer describing their sound as a sea lion barking over a load of pneumatic drills, which is what their first album sounds like when you first hear it – I remember hearing it and saying, "If that's what it's going to be like, that's it. I'll quit before I've done anything."

Then I listened to that album on headphones – we lived in a block of flats and we couldn't really play music at night – and I listened right through the night. I thought, "Well, I want to see what this is about. And I'll listen to it until I decide it's rubbish, and I'll probably quit, if that's the way music's going to be, or else I'll see something in it." I listened to it for thirty-six hours straight – and I wrote "Watching the Detectives."

We were all living in this block of flats, and nobody had an awful lot of money – I don't want to sound like my-deprived-background, but nobody did. And there were all these people in 1977, when the Jubilee was on, wasting their money on a bloody street party for the Queen. Perhaps it sounds small-minded now, but I used to really enjoy playing "God Save the Queen," loud, because all the little old ladies would be so outraged.

"God, did you see the Sex Pistols on the TV last night?" On the way to work, I'd be on the platform in the morning and all the commuters would be reading the papers when the Pistols made headline – and said "fuck." It was as if it was the most awful thing that ever happened. It's a mistake to confuse that with a major event in history, but it was a great morning – just to hear people's blood pressure going up and down over it.

I wrote a lot of songs in the summer of 1977: "Welcome to the Working Week," "Red Shoes," "Miracle Man," "Alison," "Sneaky Feelings," "Waiting for the End of the World," "I'm Not Angry," all more or less in one go, in about two or three weeks.

Your first single was "Less than Zero." When did you write that?
Earlier in the year. I saw a program with Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British fascist movement of the Thirties. And there he was on TV, saying, "No, I'm not anti-Semitic, of course I'm not – doesn't matter even if I was!" His attitude was that time could make it all right! It was a very English way of accepting things that used to really irritate me, really annoy me. The complacency, the moral complacency there – that they would just accept this vicious old man: not string him up on the spot!

This was the time when the National Front and the British Movement were recruiting with great success – and they of course derived directly from Mosley's old British Union of Fascists.
They were the same old bastards, the same old weirdos like Colin Jordan that kept reappearing, and denying they had any fascist overtones, and then there would be pictures taken of them dressing up in pervy Hitler Youth uniforms. They're really sick people. If there wasn't a danger that some people of limited intelligence would take them seriously, they'd be sad and you'd feel sorry for them. But you can't. There are people gullible enough and there are enough problems – the same way as you've got here. You can point fingers and say, "These are the people who are the source of all your problems: it's the black people." It's the same as saying, "It's the Jews . . . . " I'm English, but my ancestry is Irish, and they used to say the same about the Irish as well. My wife's Irish. Sooner or later, we'll probably have to leave England – because I'm sure the people of England will try and send the Irish back.

We cut the first singles without any impact. My immediate reaction was, "Well, maybe I haven't got it." If I'd been somebody like Johnny Cougar, signed to a major label – someone with a five-album deal for a million dollars – I suppose I would have felt, "Well, I'm secure now, I can write some songs," but I wasn't sure. Stiff was running from week to week – we were totally independent, we weren't licensed, we had no national distribution: it was mail-order. We finished the album in six-hour sessions; there were no days in the studio. Jake said, "Well, we're going to put it out" – but one moment it was going to be Wreckless Eric on one side, me on the other, as a way of presenting two new writers. There were a million ideas a day floating around; it was all improvised and all governed by a very limited budget.

You had picked your name well before that?
I hadn't picked it at all, Jake picked it. It was just a marketing scheme "How are we going to separate you from Johnny This and Johnny That?" He said, "We'll call you Elvis." I thought he was completely out of his mind.

Riviera was right, perhaps because he knew Declan McManus could live up to his new name. With 'My Aim Is True,' recorded with the American country-rock band Clover and produced by Nick Lowe, Costello stepped out as a major figure in British new music; the American release of the LP on CBS later in the year, a brilliant appearance on 'Saturday Night Live' and his first tour with the newly recruited Attractions, brought, if anything, an even more fierce response in the U.S. Along with Lowe and Riviera, Costello left Stiff for the now-defunct Radar label (Costello now records for F-Beat in the U.K.), and he and the Attractions followed a remarkable first year with 'This Year's Model' ("A ghost version of 'Aftermath,' " Costello told me, noting that, having never been much of a Rolling Stones fan, he'd never heard the record until a few months before making 'Model.' He responded to my comments about the strength of the LP with the information that Nick Lowe's contribution was to "sweeten it" – that furious album was sweetened?) and a tour far more confident and hard-edged than the one that had preceded it.

In 1979 Costello offered perhaps his most ambitious record, 'Armed Forces' – originally and more appropriately titled 'Emotional Fascism.' It was a tricky, allusive set of words, voices and shifting instrumental textures, primarily influenced, Costello says, by the music he and the Attractions had been able to agree on as listening material while touring the U.S. in a station wagon; David Bowie's 'Low' and 'Heroes,' Iggy Pop's 'Lust for Life' and 'The Idiot,' Kraftwerk's 'Autobahn,' and most of all, Abba's 'Arrival.' ("'Oliver's Army' was most successful," Costello says of the LP's U.K. hit, a bright, poppy cut that would have been released as a single in the U.S. had Costello been willing to take out the line characterizing army recruits as "white niggers" – the whole point of the tune. "That was the aim," he says. "A grim heart in the middle of an Abba record.") As Jim Miller has written, on 'Armed Forces' "personal relations are perceived as a metaphor for relations in society at large . . . [Costello's] stance may begin with private refusals, but it ends with public references."

In a bizarre manner, that truth was acted out, on its head, during Costello's 1979 tour of the U.S., when one night in a bar in Columbus, Ohio, at odds with Bonnie Bramlett and other members of the Stephen Stills Band, Costello suddenly denounced Ray Charles as "a blind, ignorant nigger," said much the same about James Brown, and attacked the stupidity of American black music in particular and America in general. Bramlett decked him; the incident quickly made the papers, then 'People' magazine, and the resulting scandal forced a New York press conference – Costello's first real face-to-face encounter with journalists since the fall of 1977 – where be tried to explain himself, and, according to both Costello and those who questioned him, failed. This, from a man who had produced the first album by the Specials, the U.K.'s pioneers of interracial music? Who at some risk had taken on the National Front with "Night Rally," and appeared at Rock Against Racism concerts – and who, again to quote Jim Miller, was plainly "obsessed with the reality of domination wherever it occurs"? A man who had ended 'Armed Forces' with a blazing cover of Nick Lowe's "(What's So Funny 'bout) Peace, Love and Understanding?" – a song that, as Costello performed it, was, yes, ironic, especially given such nightmares as "Goon Squad," which preceded it, but was nevertheless not a joke? What happened?

It's become a terrible thing, hanging over my head – it's horrible to work hard for a long time and find that what you're best known for is something as idiotic as . . . this.

Do you really think that this incident is what you're best known for?
Yes. The first thing that a lot of people heard about me was that incident. I think it outweighs my entire career – which is a pretty depressing prospect. I'm absolutely convinced.

Fred Schruers wrote a piece about it – a sort of "tenor of the tour." About the fact that we went around with Camp Lejeune on the front of our bus – Camp Lejeune, where they train the marines. He said it was like an exercise in paranoia. To an extent, it was. The antijournalist thing we were doing, the antiphotographer thing, had reached an almost excessive level by that point. Schruers said that the press were looking for something to crucify me with, and I fed myself to the lions. There were words to that effect. I remember them distinctly. And I couldn't help but agree, to a certain extent, looking – aside from the incident itself – dispassionately at the effect of what happened.

What actually happened was this: we were in the bar – Bruce Thomas and I were in the bar after the show in Columbus, Ohio. And we were very drunk. Well, we weren't drunk to begin with – we were reasonably drunk. And we started into what you'd probably call joshing. Gentle gibes between the two camps of the Stills Band and us. It developed as it got drunker and drunker into a nastier and nastier argument. And I suppose that in the drunkenness, my contempt for them was probably exaggerated beyond my real contempt for them. I don't think I had a real opinion. But they just seemed in some way to typify a lot of things that I thought were wrong with American music. And that's probably quite unfair. But at the exact moment – they did.

Things such as what?
Insincerity, dishonesty – musical dishonesty.

How so?
I just think they're . . . This is difficult, because this is getting right off the point. Because now I'm getting into mudslinging.

But now we're trying to talk about what it was really about.
What it was about was that I said the most outrageous thing I could possibly say to them – that I knew, in my drunken logic, would anger them more than anything else.That's why I don't want to get into why I felt so affronted by them, because that's not important. It's not important because ... they don't mean anything to me. They don't even mean anything now – I don't feel any malice in the way I feel that they probably exploited the incident to get some free publicity.

My initial reaction – I can tell you now – to seeing Bonnie Bramlett get free publicity out of my name was that, "Well, she rode to fame on the back of one E.C., she's not gonna do it on the back of another." But that was before the consquences of what had happened had sunk in – that was a flip way of dismissing it.

Did you have any idea of how dangerous, or how exploitable, or how plainly offensive, what you said would be in a public context?
No, because it was never intended – if I hadn't been drunk I would never have said those things. If it had been a considered argument, I probably would have either not pursued the argument to such extreme length, or I would have thought of something a little bit more coherent, another form of attack, rather than just outrage. Outrage is fairly easy. Not in terms of dealing with the consequences, but in terms of employing it as a tactic in an argument.

With the press conference in New York a few days later, the situation reminded me of nothing so much as the "We're more popular than Jesus" blowup with the Beatles.
It had approximately the same effect on our career. The minute the story was published nationally, records were taken off playlists. About 120 death threats – or threats of violence of some kind. I had armed bodyguards for the last part of that tour.

And not since?
For one tour since. Not armed, but . . . .

But not now?
We take more care with security than we did before.

Were records taken out of stores?
I don't know – there may have been. Just like people won't sell South African goods. I mean – quite rightly so! Until there was an explanation.

The press conference was unsuccessful because I was fried on that tour. This is aside from the incident; now I'm talking from a personal point of view.

It was at that point that everything – whether it be my self-perpetrated venom – was about to engulf me. I was, I think, rapidly becoming not a very nice person. I was losing track of what I was doing, why I was doing it, and my own control.

In your first interview, in 1977 with Nick Kent of 'NME,' you made a famous statement: words to the effect that all you knew of human emotions were revenge and guilt. Those words have been endlessly quoted – I've quoted them, they're irresistible. Now you're describing that as venom – as if your artistic venom, what you put into your music, had engulfed your own life.
I think it did. I think it started to take over. You see, I think that after a while – apart from anything else, looking from a purely artistic point of view – it started to become a problem for me to incorporate the wider, more compassionate point of view that I felt; I was trying to put that forward in some of the songs, and it was so much at odds with the preconception of the image.

When we were playing, the frustration of that just ate me up. And with my lack of personal control of my life, and my supposed emotions, and drinking too much, and being on the road too much –

I'm not saying I wasn't responsible for my actions; that sounds like I'm trying to excuse myself. But I was not very responsible. There's a distinct difference. I was completely irresponsible, in fact. And far from carefree – careless with everything. With everything that I really care about. And I think that, inasmuch as it was said that we fed ourselves to the lions, you could say that whatever the incident was, it was symptomatic of the condition I was in, and that I deserved what happened regardless of the intentions of the remarks.

But it was only quite recently that I realized that it's not only the man on the street, as it were, who's never heard of me otherwise, who's only read People – that it's not only people like that who know only this about me. When we were recording Imperial Bedroom, Bruce Thomas was in the next studio while I was doing a vocal. Paul McCartney was there, and Michael Jackson came in to do a vocal – everything was very nice Everyone was getting along fine until somebody introduced Bruce as my bass player. And suddenly – there was a freeze-out. Michael Jackson was – "Oh, God, I don't dig that guy . . . I don't dig that guy."

He had heard about it third hand, from Quincy Jones. Two guys I have a tremendous amount of admiration for. It depressed me that I wouldn't be able to go up to him – I wouldn't be able to go up and shake his hand, because he wouldn't want to shake my hand. Or James Brown, for that matter. But what could I say? What could I say? How could you explain such a thing? But there is nothing I'd like more.

Costello and the Attractions returned to England, wondering if they could ever return to America, and made 'Get Happy!!': "Our version of a Motown album," Costello says. "I had the feeling people were reading my mind – but what could I do, hold up a sign that read, I REALLY LIKE BLACK PEOPLE? Like Tom Robinson or Joan Baez? Turn myself into Steve Marriott: 'My skin is white but my soul is black'?"

The band almost broke up; Steve Nieve quit, Costello finished up a European tour with Martin Belmont of the Rumour, and then Costello quit – briefly.

The band put itself back together, and produced 'Trust,' a singers showcase, and 'Almost Blue,' a less-than-convincing country music tribute recorded in Nashville and produced by Billy Sherrill. One sweltering night in 1981 in Los Angeles, Costello – with two of the Attractions and Nick Lowe – took part in the taping of a George Jones Home Box Office special; puffed up with the mumps and swaddled in heavy clothes, he proved himself more of a professional and more of an artist than the country superstars who clowned and fussed their way through their numbers. On record, he has again found all of his voice: 'Imperial Bedroom' is his most adventurous and successful recording since 'Armed Forces' – or 'This Year's Model.' Costello's thoughts on quitting the game, his state of mind after 'Get Happy!!,' remain worth considering.

I didn't want to do anymore. I didn't see any point. It was a question of deciding whether we were going to be a cult act.

We were operating on such a low level. I was aware of the fact that there was no way that Get Happy!! was going to be a Number One record – or in a different sense, any record at all. That record was called another "Angry Young Man" record! We were a little, pigeoned cult – "Oh, yeah, they're the Angry Young Man act. We've got them numbered."

We weren't actually achieving any change if we weren't selling more records than REO Speed-wagon. So long as we were only as commercially effective as Randy Newman –

Randy Newman doesn't really play for the people who should hear his songs. He plays to polite, amused – I sat sickened through the best concert I think he's done in London, at Drury Lane just after Good Old Boys came out; people were guffawing through "Davy, the Fat Boy." I couldn't watch him for the audience.

That was the way I felt: that we were comfortably contained within the business, instead of having some dramatic effect on the structure of the business. You'd just be another pawn. The people that formed United Artists – they had control over their own artistic destiny by forming the company. Barring being able to do that, you can actually change the structure of the scene that you're working within by being the biggest thing in it.

There's also the possibility of affecting the way people actually respond to the world.
Well, that's the initial intention of writing the songs to begin with, isn't it.

That's the view that you put into that one song – whether it be about something extremely large, or not at all. I wrote a song called "Hoover Factory" – about a lovely deco building that was going to be torn down. I said, "It's not a matter of life or death – but what is?"

There is a song on Imperial Bedroom, "The Loved Ones," that is the hardest song to get over. Considering it's got such a light pop tune, it's like saying, "Fuck posterity; it's better to live." It's the opposite of Rust Never Sleeps. It's about, Fuck being a junkie and dying in some phony romantic way like Brendan Behan or Dylan Thomas. Somebody in your family's got to bury you, you know?

That's a complicated idea to put in a pop song. I didn't want to write a story around it – I wanted to just throw all of those ideas into a song. Around a good pop hook.

And that, in a nice, simple statement, is a philosophy of pop: from a man whose work and career have shown that the pursuit of such a philosophy is anything but simple – and also worth the candle.

This story is from the September 2nd, 1982 issue of Rolling Stone.  

he interview that follows took place on April 17th, just a few days into the Who's eighteen-date spring tour of the United States and Canada: their second new-world tour since drummer Keith Moon died at thirty-one on September 7th, 1978, and their first since eleven people died in the crush of fans trying to force their way into the Who's concert at Cincinnati's Riverfront Coliseum on December 3rd, 1979.

That event made headlines all over the world, most often as a condemnation of rock & roll (as on CBS news), or simply of America. Sixteen years as a unique and seminal rock & roll band aside, what happened in Cincinnati has probably made the Who more famous than they have ever been. Millions who had never heard of Keith Moon now think they know who the Who are.

In the world of rock & roll, the Who's status has also changed. People have rallied around the band. Though the Who have never placed a Number One album or single on the Billboard charts, they have represented the very spirit of rock & roll to a growing mass of fans; the Who's confrontation with disaster has made the group even more important as a standard-bearer, and raised the possibility that, having only just returned to live performances after two and a half years off the road, the band might be forced off the stage for good. The T-shirts fans are wearing tell the story: I Survived The Who, on the backs of a few, The Who Cares, on the backs of a lot more.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, where Townshend and I talked, excitement, at least in the media, was pervasive. For days preceding the Who's three sold-out concerts at the 14,000-seat Oakland Coliseum Arena, the drums were beating with a message that could not be missed. Along with the usual ticket giveaways, radio stations programmed "all-Who" weekends, "the Who A-to-Z" weekends (and they have a Z, too: "Zoot Suit," the B side of their first record, cut in 1964 as the High Numbers), run long, pretaped interviews with Pete Townshend, and fondly recalled the Who's "American debut" at Monterey in 1967 (it wasn't; it was in New York in 1966). Smaller cinemas put on double bills of the band's two 1979 films, the fictional 'Quadrophenia' and the career-documentary 'The Kids Are Alright,' both of which had died early at local first-run houses. The day the Who left town, the radio jumped on Empty Glass, Pete Townshend's new solo album – with vocals, guitar and synthesizer by Townshend, piano and organ by John "Rabbit" Bundrick and bass by Tony Butler of On the Air, a band led by Simon Townshend, Pete's brother.

Such a buildup (and follow-through – two weeks after the Who left town, the airwaves were still full of their music) was common in the late Sixties, but nothing like it had been heard since: not for the Stones, not for Dylan, not for anyone.

The Who are, in some ways, a new band: along with Kenney Jones (who replaced Moon on drums), they have added Rabbit on piano, organ and synthesizer. After the end of the spring tour the Who returned to England to complete an album, tentatively set for release in the fall. They hit the U.S. in June for another tour, this time touching down in Los Angeles and heading for the South.

At the same time, the band is caught in its past. It's not the immediate past, of Keith Moon's death and the disaster in Cincinnati. ("We can do fourteen dead here," said a woman outside the Oakland coliseum, handing out fliers for the forthcoming concert by John Lydon's PiL. "We can beat Cincinnati." The Bay Area has always had the world's stupidest punks.) When we talked – before the show I saw – Pete Townshend spoke of the Who's history as, among other things, a burden: "A great knapsack – you carry it around, and nobody ever empties it. You've got the old stale sandwiches in it, as well as the new ones." But that history – and the Who's history may be more vivid, more coherent, than that of any other band with a tenure even approaching theirs – can also be a crutch.

As their show opened – with "Substitute" (1966), "I Can't Explain" (the band's first record as the Who, 1965) and "Baba O'Riley" (1971) – it was impossible to think of the songs as oldies, or even as classics. With the volume loud enough to be totally satisfying – and loud enough to leave me with a partially paralyzed lower lip and a sore wrist for three days – the songs were undeniable: rock & roll facts, preexistent entities waiting for the Who to discover them. The Who didn't sound like they were referring to what had gone before: they sounded as if they were starting all over again, from the necessary beginning.

100 Greatest Artists: The Who

But as the show moved on – and into the more abstract and less social material from Tommy, or 1978's Who Are You – the performance, at least for me, settled down. Other fans – the teenage junkie behind me, the college students in front – grew ever more excited, but in a way they also settled down: they were waiting for their favorites, and the shape of the concert insured that they would get them. If the show was not quite the Who's Greatest Hits, it was the History of the Who. Aside from a couple of numbers from Quadrophenia, and "Dancing in the Street" as part of a three-song encore, there were no surprises: no unrecorded material, nothing from the unfinished album, no obscurities, be they "I Don't Even Know Myself" or "Pictures of Lily" or "The Seeker." The band gave the audience what it wanted, but they didn't entice the audience to want more than it had thought of wanting – which is what the Who, like all great rock & roll bands in their great days, have been all about.

Technically, the show was superb: shot through with fun and movement. Roger Daltrey seemed to run in place for two solid hours. Townshend's crouched leaps were thrilling – spectacular but not gaudy, aggressive but not cruel. No one in the Who ever seemed bored by the material. The band changed the show over the next two nights. They cut it down, stretched it out, shuffled the songs, varied the encores – and, according to one fan who saw all three concerts, Townshend never played the same solo twice. The band sounded as compact and uncompromised as it ever has. Rabbit and a horn section added a kind of subliminal fullness. But it was a show based on the "stature" Pete Townshend talks about below, not a show intended to subvert it.

To a man, the Who looked terrific. Roger Daltrey and Kenney Jones were dressed in T-shirts and denims, and worked like athletes. John Entwistle, as always, stood stock still, and this time wore a neat white suit, which set him off perfectly. As for Townshend, he appeared onstage in an impressive navy blue jacket: he looked like a world-beater. When, after a few numbers, he took it off, revealing a Clash T-shirt with the sleeves rolled up, his pants suddenly seemed baggy – and he struck me as just another rock & roll anomaly. Just another Buddy Holly: the kid you laugh at, if you bother to do that, the kid who one day comes out of his shell and changes your life.

As that Clash T-shirt was no doubt meant to show, Townshend remains a fan. Since "I Can't Explain" he has been one of rock & roll's first-rank creators, definers; but since a memorable interview appeared in these pages in 1968, he has also been its premier participant-philosopher – or, if you like, player-coach. What follows below is merely the latest installment of that career. –G.M.

It seems to me that the love songs on Empty Glass are much more personal than they've been for the past few years – not confessional, but clearly directed to a person. There's a passion in "A Little Is Enough" that seems very new.
I think probably because I've had a harder time, lately. Before Keith died, I decided that practically all the personal problems I had – whatever they were, whether it was boozing, or difficulty at home with my family – was because of the Who on the road. When we came off the road, I spent two and a half years not touring – under great pressure from the band to tour, but I resisted, and said, "No, I want to try it and see what happens." I got to the end of that period, and all my problems were still there. Some of them were worse. But what was strange about that time was that it somehow opened me up: I was able to put a slightly different slant on the qualities that I look for, or that other people look for, in life.

With a song like "A Little Is Enough," what was interesting to me was that I was able to very easily put into words something that had actually happened to me when I was a thirty-four-year-old. It wasn't self-conscious; it wasn't a song written from a stance. It wasn't objective. It was purely personal: instant, and purely transparent. It's very emotional, but it's also very straightforward and clear. Just the fact that you can't fucking have the world. If you're lucky enough to get a tiny piece of it, then – fine. When that's applied to something as immense and intangible as love – whether it's spiritual love or human love . . .

I suppose I wrote the song about a mixture of things: I wrote it a little bit about God's love. But mainly about the feeling that I had for my wife – and the fact that I don't see enough of her, and that when we are together there're lots of times when things aren't good, because of the period of adjustment you require after a long tour: stuff like that. She would always want a deeper, more sustained relationship than I would–but in the end I suppose we're lucky that we do love one another at all. Because love, by its very nature, is an infinite quality, an infinite emotion – just to experience it once in a lifetime is enough. Because a lot of people don't – don't ever experience it.

A lot of the songs on the album – well, "Let My Love Open the Door" is just a ditty – but particularly "A Little Is Enough" and a couple of the others – "I Am an Animal." I think – are getting close to what I feel I want to be writing: in terms of somebody who's thirty-five writing a rock song, but one which isn't in the George Jones – Willie Nelson tradition – "I'm a smashed-up fucker standing at the bar . . ." "Empty Glass" is a direct jump from Persian Sufi poetry. Hafiz – he was a poet in the fourteenth century – used to talk about God's love being wine, and that we learn to be intoxicated, and that the heart is like an empty cup. You hold up the heart, and hope that God's grace will fill your cup with his wine. You stand in the tavern, a useless soul waiting for the barman to give you a drink – the barman being God. It's also Meher Baba talking about the fact that the heart is like a glass, and that God can't fill it up with his love – if it's already filled with love for yourself. I used those images deliberately. It was quite weird going to Germany and talking to people over there about it: "This 'Empty Glass' – is that about you becoming an alcoholic?"

That George Jones tradition – which is apparently where the person in Germany plugged in "Empty Glass" – can be just as stultifying as if you felt it always necessary to write in the voice of a seventeen-year-old: as if that were the only way a song you wrote could have any validity as rock & roll.
I think what's always been my problem, though, is that I've always been fascinated by the period of adolescence – and by the fact that rock's most frenetic attachments, most long-lasting attachments, the deepest connections, seem to happen during adolescence, or just postadolescence. Rock does evolve, and it does change, and it does go through various machinations, but to you, as a listener, someone who needs both the music and the exchange of ideas – you always tend to listen in the same way. You expect – and you feel happiest when you get – an album that does for you what your first few albums did. You're always looking for that: you're always looking for that first fuck. Of course, you can never have that first fuck, but you're always looking for it. Occasionally, you get very close. Always chasing the same feeling, the same magic.

I think the strangest thing for me – and I think perhaps the Who are unique in this respect – is that we seem to be able to continue, even though I think my writing is clumsier than it was in the early days. It's less easy for me to completely open up. because I'm not alone anymore. When I wrote the first five or six hit songs for the Who. I was completely and totally alone. I had no girlfriend, no friends, no nothing – it was me addressing the world. That's where the power of that early stuff comes from. But despite the fact that the later material is less transparent, less wholesome to some extent, we still appeal to a very young audience. Sometimes preadolescents. But always, always, there is a very, very strong grab – a deep, instant grab – which lasts . . . forever. It's not like a fad. People who get into the Who when they're thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, never stop being fans. The Who don't necessarily captivate the whole teenage generation – as each batch comes up every year – but we certainly hit a percentage of them, and we hold them.

Just after Cincinnati, just after the news hit that eleven people had been killed trying to get into your show, there were statements on the radio from you and from Roger Daltrey, and my wife was very disturbed by something Roger said: simply a reference to the people who had died as "the kids." She said, "But they weren't all kids – one of those people was a mother with two kids of her own." What that expression meant to her was that the audience was no longer real to the band: the audience had become faceless, physically present but also somehow invisible. Whoever was in the audience, they were "the kids." It was as if there were an enormous gulf separating the band from its audience – as if there were no way to feel the kind of identification she and I felt when we first saw the band in 1967, when it became obvious that the band and its audience were part of the same reality a reality we were both creating, or a story we were both telling. Do you think there is that kind of gulf?
Yes. I think there is. When I think back to the days at the Marquee – we got a regular Tuesday night residency, which was a big coup for us, because we didn't even have a record out. The first night, there were maybe fifty people, the next night, two hundred, and after that we were packing it. We were a cult within a cult – our whole audience was nineteen years old, as we were – and there's a great feeling of affirmation when the audience knows they're sharing in the success; they're making the success happen as well. So you become incredibly close. The two or three thousand people who regularly attended the Marquee residency – I think I know them all by their first names.

One of the problems, today, is not an obvious one. Roger – who, dare I say it tends occasionally to jump to conclusions about what's going on, and maybe sticks to them until someone can talk him out of them, jumps to a wrong conclusion when he feels that the gulf is created by a difference in age. I think it's more to do with a difference in stature. The Who are an enormous business machine, surrounded by all kinds of controversy – and I suppose a great amount of media power. A lot of that comes from the success of things that are happening around the band. The Tommy film is a case in point: an average, entertaining film, blown all out of proportion – the David Frost show. Allan Carr with his famous parties, Oscar presentations. It's really got very little to do with front-line rock & roll, but it does affect the way people see the band.

But there is also the fact that the band's history starts to accumulate. To be in existence for fifteen years, and still be working, still be appearing on a stage . . . People can actually pay money and go and see this band who have got – not so much a wonderful backlog of material behind them, but who have actually got a history.

It's like discovering a new author. You run out of books to read, and suddenly you discover that you like F. Scott Fitzgerald. You start, and you read all his books, and you're really pissed off the day you come to the end of them. Then you go on to your next author – you might discover Salinger. And you go through that lot. And you get pissed off when you run out. This often happens to you when you're quite young – and what's a big kick for a lot of young kids who get into the Who is the discovery that there's so much to get into. We do exist now, we are putting out product, but there's a lot more they can find. So although there is a gulf, I think there is also a fascination in the fact that people might feel that gulf to start with, but also feel there's an opportunity, by a kind of investigative listening, and studying, and reading books about the band or going to see the films – there's a chance they can get closer.

All I can tell you is that I meet kids on the road – and they are kids, sixteen to twenty – and they treat me just like the guy next door. They've got no deep respect for me; there's no fanaticism. It's an absolute, one-to-one relationship. There's a familiarity, a sense of naturalness. I think that could only come about if they felt close to me. It doesn't happen with everybody – but it happens with quite a few people.

Of course, it's going to be different if you're fucking eighteen- or nineteen-year-olds – I don't think I'd go and watch the Who, even if I lived in America. I mean, I'd sit and wait until the Clash came: I'd go and see them. And hope I'd get one of their good nights!

Is there any point to the Who carrying on, as a touring band, any point beyond pandering to an audience that has become so conservative, so fearful of new experiences, that latching onto a rock legend – and whatever else the Who is, it is that – can become a reactionary defensive way of resisting new and challenging music? That isn't to say – or to deny – that your music today is unimaginative, old-fashioned, or whatever – that's irrelevant. I've been struck, over the last few years, by the fact that the great bulk of the American rock & roll audience will do almost anything to avoid having to deal with something that's radically new.
Me too – I think you're absolutely right. It's very, very strange: in Britain, at the moment, we've got 2-Tone, we've still got punk, we've got mod bands, we've got heavy-metal bands, we've got established supergroups, we've got all kinds of different families of music – each of which takes an enormous amount of adjustment. They're intense, and very socially . . . jagged. They don't fit neatly into existing society: they challenge it. And yet in America, kids seem to be quite happy. Rock, to them, is enough: establishment rock is enough. That seems very peculiar to me. There are obviously lots of subdivisions of music in America, but I think that's something record companies dream up. In reality, whether it's black music or white rock music, I think the truth of the matter is exactly as you've said. It's not necessarily something as big as fear – it's fucking uncomfortableness, listening to a Sex Pistols record. It worries you, because somebody is speaking the truth.

People in the States don't necessarily refuse to admit that problems exist, but it's a country that believes in success – that ultimate success lies in the hands of man. Whereas, rock doesn't. Newer rock, particularly, actually affirms the futility of man, in all respects but one. It says, in a word, in a sentence, what Meher Baba said: "Don't worry – you're not big enough to deal with it." It's just gone too crazy. Do your best and leave the results to God.

When you listen to the Sex Pistols, to "Anarchy in the U.K." and "Bodies" and tracks like that, what immediately strikes you is that this is actually happening. This is a bloke, with a brain on his shoulders, who is actually saying something he sincerely believes is happening in the world, saying it with real venom, and real passion.

It touches you, and it scares you – it makes you feel uncomfortable. It's like somebody saying, "The Germans are coming! And there's no way we're gonna stop 'em!" That's one of the reasons: a lot of new music is harder to listen to. So you get a band like the Clash, and they come out with a nifty little song like "Clampdown," and you can't hear the words, and they'll play it on the radio in L.A. You read the fucking words, they scare the shit out of you. Or the Pretenders – Chrissie Hynde's got a sweet voice, but she writes in double-speak: she's talking about getting laid by Hell's Angels on her latest record! And raped. The words are full of the most brutal. head-on feminism that has ever come out of any band, anywhere!

And yet it's only because it's disguised that it's getting played, and getting appreciated. To some extent, both the Clash and the Pretenders are getting played because their music is slightly more palatable, slightly closer to the old form. I saw so many new bands go down in England, so many great bands, because unless you were in exactly the right frame of mind, felt the same way, felt as abandoned, felt as anarchistic, and felt as I-don't-give-a-shit as they did, you just couldn't enjoy it. And in fact – to answer the question you asked at the beginning of all this – for the Who, at the moment, to go out as an established band, requires a lot of that don't-give-a-shit attitude. We don't give a shit whether the audience has a problem or not. All we know is that for us, to go on a stage, get instant communication, know that people have done their homework, have an instant connection with the audience, go backstage afterward into a dressing room full of the most beautiful women you can ever hope to lay your eyes on, never have anybody say anything nasty to you, everybody's friendly, everybody's wonderful, people don't throw us out of hotels anymore –

I mean, life revolves quite nicely – you know what I'm saying? I'm getting paid a lot of money for the privilege. The first ten years in the Who were fucking awful; miserable, violent, unhappy times. It's nice to now sit back and enjoy it. It might be brief; for the sake of rock music in some ways I hope it is brief. For me, maybe I don't hope it's brief.

We've very much dropped our idealistic stance in terms of our weight of responsibility to rock's evolution. We haven't stopped caring about where it's going to go; I think we've realized that we're not capable of doing that much, in terms of actually pushing it forward. If we have got a chance of pushing it forward, I think we've got a better chance of doing it on the road than we do on record, to be quite honest.

So can the band still make history? Obviously it has made rock & roll history, and it's certainly affected social history as such. You seem to be saying that can't continue.
Maybe only history in terms of statistics, now – how many years we've been together; how many disasters we can survive.

Which is not what I meant. I meant exactly what you meant: pushing the music forward.
Well, I don't know. Who's that down to? Is it down to me? As a writer? I don't know. I think if it's down to me as a writer there might be a chance, but I don't know how much stamina I've got left.

Let me put it another way. What strikes me most about what happened in Cincinnati is that it seems, now, not to have happened at all. It has not become part of the rock & roll frame of reference, as Altamont instantly and permanently did. It seems to me that it was an event that should have signified something new about the relationship between bands and their audiences, or about rock & roll as mass culture, was taking place. It ought to have forced people to reexamine a lot of assumptions, a lot of what they took for granted. That hasn't happened.


Will that event have an effect on the Who's music? I don't mean in terms of the Who putting out a nice little commentary about it, as the Grateful Dead did after Altamont with "New Speedway Boogie"; I mean over the years, in a more profound way.
I think what's not apparent to the outside world, in the Who, is our – bloody-minded brutality. Our – determination. Our stamina, and our strength. It's not apparent, because we seem to brood so incessantly on our weaknesses, we seem to have so many phobias; like everybody who really cares about rock, we spend so much time worrying how many more years . . . But the amazing thing, for us, is the fact that – when we were told, told about what happened at that gig, that eleven kids had died – for a second, our guard dropped. Just for a second. Then it was back up again.

It was, fuck it! We're not gonna let a little thing like this stop us. That was the way we had to think. We had to reduce it. We had to reduce it, because if we'd actually admitted to ourselves the true significance of the event, the true tragedy of the event – not just in terms of "rock," but the fact that it happened at one of our concerts – the tragedy to us, in particular, if we'd admitted to that, we could not have gone on and worked. And we had a tour to do. We're a rock & roll band. You know, we don't fuck around, worrying about eleven people dying. We care about it, but there is a particular attitude I call the "tour armor": when you go on the road you throw up an armor around yourself, you almost go into a trance. I don't think you lose your humanity, but, think: for ten, maybe fifteen years, the Who smashed up hotel rooms – why? Where's the pleasure in it? We actually quite relished general violence. I don't understand why it happened. It doesn't happen now, but it did happen, for a long time. I think that, for me, tours were like a dream.

I was literally wearing armor. The only thing that would ever crack it, for me, at a show, would be if my wife and kids were there. Or my brother – he'd be, what? Eleven or twelve years old. Simon: he's got a band of his own now, On the Air. I used to really worry about him. He'd like to be right up front, and if I saw trouble happening – that would be my link. That would pierce my armor.

In a way, I think you're wrong about what you were saying about a gulf. When I say armor, I mean armor that actually allows you to be more abandoned, and freer, that allows you to be tougher, harder – genuinely tougher and harder. I'm not trying to glamorize it, and it's not something that I'm necessarily proud of. The Who's macho tendencies, in some ways, weaken our audience: our audience is about eighty percent male.

You say that if you had allowed yourself to really think about, to really face the true tragedy of what happened in Cincinnati, you would have had to stop – but you couldn't stop, you didn't want to stop, there was no point to stopping. But once the tour was over – or maybe a year after, or two years – isn't it important, if the band is going to continue to make sense of where it's been and where it's going, to somehow integrate that event, to absorb it: to allow it to affect you, in terms of the music you make and the way you perform it?
I don't know, because so far, we've had a series of quite unfortunate reactions.

How do you mean?
I think the way festival seating was blamed, wholesale, for practically all the problems, was quite a nasty, negative overreaction – because I like festival seating. When I go to a concert I don't want to have to fucking sit in a numbered seat, and get clobbered over the head every time I stand up. I like to be able to move about, I like to be able to dance if I want to, or go and buy a Coke if I want to, or push my way to the front if I want to, or hide in the back if I want to! I also know, from the stage, that you get the best atmosphere with festival seating.

Yesterday was a case in point: the second date we did in Seattle. I saw five or six punch-outs, because of people just not wanting to stand up at the same time as the person in front of them. You see one guy punching some guy out 'cause he's standing up, and fifteen minutes later he's standing up and the guy behind him is punching him out. Everybody's got a different reaction time – a different moment when they feel they want to get up and jump. One person thinks that the time to get up and jump is the guitar solo in "My Wife," and somebody else thinks it's when Roger goes, "See-ee meeee, fee-eel me –" I mean, who knows? You don't get that kind of conflict at general-admission shows.

That's one reason. Another is that immediately after the Cincinnati gig, to protect ourselves partly from legal recriminations, we doubled, trebled and quadrupled external security at halls. The problem with Cincinnati was external security, external control: external people control. People in large numbers need controlling. They're – they're like cattle. But a lot of kids complained; everywhere they'd look there was a cop. It spoiled their evening for them. They felt, okay, it happened in Cincinnati, but we don't need that. There was an article in the paper in Seattle, complaining about the fact that there was too much security. It said, "This isn't Germany. The kids in Seattle don't rampage. There's never been even a slight injury at a concert . . ." et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

All of which is quite meaningless: "It can't happen here." That's just what I meant about the event seeming not to have happened, to have been deflected.
Probably – but at the same time, it was interesting that the first serious problems they had at Seattle coliseum were at our two gigs [this tour]: the first two gigs they've done with reserved seating on the floor. It's the first time they've actually had audience-inflicted injuries.*

The other side of it is worth mentioning: the fact that the Who don't just get their strength from wearing armor. We did go home, and we did think about it, and we talked about it with our families and our friends. I went home to about ten letters, from the families of the kids who'd died: letters full of deep, deep affection and support and encouragement. It wasn't like these people were being recriminatory. The father of the girl who died who had two children was writing to say that it would hurt him, the family, the friends of the family and friends of the girl, if they knew that because of what happened, because of her death, we changed our feelings about rock. They understood her feelings about the band, and about the music – you know what I'm saying?

We actually left the States – I know Roger and I had a long conversation about it – with an incredible feeling of, without being mordant about it, of love for the American people. Everybody had been so positive, and so supportive and understanding – even to the point where people would come up to me and say, "We know it wasn't your fault." And to some extent it was our fault. It's not exactly the way the Cronkite report made it look, but there was a great share of responsibility there, and people were so willing to – not so much to forgive, but firstly to get us back into shape, so that perhaps it was possible for us to behave in a truly realistic, responsive way about the whole thing.

I think only time will tell. If I could dare say it, I'd say that Cincinnati was a very, very positive event for the Who. I think it changed the way we feel about people. It's changed the way we feel about our audience.

In terms of affection?
In terms of affection, and also remembering constantly that they are human beings – and not just people in rows. And I hope the reverse: that people who come to see the band will know that we're human beings too, and not this myth you were talking about earlier.

I mean, I watched Roger Daltrey cry his eyes out after that show. I didn't, but he did. But now, whenever a fucking journalist – sorry – asks you about Cincinnati, they expect you to come up with a fucking theatrical tear in your eye! You know: "Have you got anything to say about Cincinnati?" "Oh, we were deeply moved, terrible tragedy, the horror, loss of life, arrrrghh –" What do you do? We did all the things we thought were right to do at the time: sent flowers to the fucking funerals. All . . . wasted. I think when people are dead they're dead.

When I was in England a couple of months ago, there was constant talk of youth-culture violence, particularly from skinheads, and there seemed to be a general feeling that the violence was increasing. Geoff Travis of Rough Trade [a record shop and label in the Notting Hill area of London] spoke of the violence, in his store and on the street, as a day-to-day fact. I asked him why he thought this was happening, and he gave me various explanations having to do with the economic and political situation in Britain – but he also said that he thought Quadrophenia, the movie, had had an effect. He thought that the movie glamorized violence between youth movements, and also very much exaggerated the mod-rocker violence that did take place in the early- to mid-Sixties, when the movie is set – that the violence was nowhere near so intense as the movie shows it to be. What do you think about that?
Well – I'm sorry to say that I suppose in a way I think he's right. It's very difficult when you make a film – when you produce a film – because in the last analysis you have to hand it over to the director. I wrote the script, originally – the first draft screenplay I wrote with Chris Stamp – and there was no riot scene at all. Not at all. For me, Quadrophenia was about the fights, and the riots, happening in the kid's head. The threat: "I'll do anything, I'll go anywhere" – and what you're dealing with is a little wimp. Who's fucking useless. Who couldn't fight anybody. He had his few pills, and his bottle of gin, and he felt like he could.

It was a study in spiritual desperation: the fact that all that desperation and frustration leads somebody to the point where for the first time in their life they realize that the only important thing is to open their heart. It wasn't about blood and guts and thunder – in the way that the film turned out to be.

It wasn't about the clash of youth cultures.
No. I suppose the director. Franc Roddam, thought it would make good cinema. And I think to some extent it's possible [the film] has sharpened [the violence] up, but I think it runs a bit deeper. A lot of skins would naturally go and see Quadrophenia, but the thing that makes skinheads violent is that – well, fundamentally they're fascists. They despise everybody – who isn't like them. It's a kind of toy fascism, fed by organized fascism: fed by Martin Webster and the National Front.

You know, I'm not afraid to say that I think fascism stinks, and I think a lot of skins stink. But I suppose I think any violence stinks, and if you pin down any of these kids, you could actually get it across to them that neither their violence nor their out their outfits nor their stance is going to change anything in British society. But most of all, they're wrong anyway: there's nothing wrong with our society. It's perfectly all right as it is. The way all societies are is that some people get, and some people don't. And if you don't fucking get, you don't go around slashing people on the face because you've not got enough money to buy a car. You hear it with dignity. The problem to some extent – when you've got a film like Quadrophenia – is that it's exploited something that's already there: the violence was already there. I don't know quite where the responsibility lies – maybe you could use the same terms I used for Cincinnati: I suppose the responsibility lies in direct proportion to everybody who makes money out of it.

Earlier, we were talking about the different strains of music that exist in Britain now, and you said each was jagged, challenging, didn't fit easily into the social order – and that things didn't seem to be that way in America. In America, when a problem becomes evident, it's common to hear. "Oh, it's just a problem in communications" – as if there couldn't really be anything that truly divides people. Whereas in Britain, the class system is recognizably the basis of the way the country works – it's part of the way this country works, too, but not recognizably – and, in Britain, there is an understanding that real things can divide people: that, inevitably, they do. That, to me, is one of the reasons you can have intensely different audiences and musics, each "jagged," not because one form of music simplistically represents a given class, but because the idea of clashing, of being separated, is part of the society itself: it's not the slightly unreal concept it often is in America. Such conflict implies change, and yet you're saying society as it is right now is just fine–perfect. I'm quite taken aback to hear you say that. It seems to me you're saying a lot more than that it's pointless to try and change society.
I'm saying it's pointless to try and change it through violence. And it's pointless to try and change it through complaint. Probably anarchy . . . Anarchy in organized society means standing up and saying, "Listen, I don't fit in, and I refuse to fit in" – and, presumably, you end up in jail. But you don't necessarily have to hurt anyone by being an anarchist; the old image of the anarchist walking around with a bomb, about to blow up the British Museum, is dated.

No – I don't think society's perfect at all. What I'm saying is that a lot of the problems that lead to violence, that occur within separatist youth movements in Britain, come from resentment that somebody is better off than they are, and they can't understand the reason why. And they then feel that if this person is better off than they – if there's a Rolls Royce to be had, and it happens to be driven by a Pakistani, then he doesn't deserve it: it belongs to me. Charlie Wilkins from Camden Town. With his Dr. Marten boots with steel-toe caps, and his hair shaved off. He probably works for the GPO – and has probably got an IQ of four. And deserves a Rolls Royce as much as a kick in the head. I mean, he deserves nothing, is what I'm saying.

Why do British rock movements last so long? Then are still Teds, or the Ted-rockabilly subculture; there are mods again; there are still skinheads, after more than a decade. London and towns outside it are full of very young kids in pure 1977 Sid Vicious regalia. Why do these movements last so long, and without developing?
I don't know. There is that deeply ingrained sense of class, and it shatters down now into separatism – but it goes a little bit deeper. There's a need for uniforms; and to some extent it doesn't matter which uniform you choose, just so long as you choose a uniform.

A lot of skins are just kids that like the look. They like football, they like to go and jostle at football matches, get involved in a few punch-outs, but not kill people. Not slash people. It's something like getting involved in a fight, and going down to the pub the next day as the hero, with a black eye.

What's important about the uniforms is that they're so extreme. You adopt the heavy-metal uniform: you wear a denim jacket, you cover it with badges of this band and that band – UFO – you take your cardboard guitar, and you go down to the Roundhouse, and you wave your long, greasy hair –

Cardboard guitars? To mime playing along?
Right. Then rockabilly: bright pink jackets, with velvet collars; drapes that go halfway down your legs, great big brothel creepers –

Brothel creepers?
Shoes with great, thick crepe soles. And drainpipe trousers, pink socks. Punk: people with beehive, pointed hair, their legs chained together, girls going to clubs with no skirts on. Mod: short, clean haircuts, military clothes –

They're all so fucking extreme: I think it invites a them-and-us situation, wherever it occurs. The way Franc Roddam tried to justify the sensationalist violence in Quadrophenia was by analyzing the relationship between the two friends; Kevin, who was the rocker, and Jimmy, who was the mod. Despite the fact that they were friends, and had a hell of a lot in common, and could have gone on to become closer, Jimmy ends up finding himself beating his own friend up, simply because he's wearing the wrong clothes.

It's so clear who are "they" and who are "us" – animosity comes quite naturally. Quite why there is the need for uniforms, I don't know. I'm still trying to work that out.



ow could the Who have released an album called The Kids Are Alright without including the original version of the song of the same name? Long unavailable, appearing only on the British pressings of the Who's first album, it featured a broken, disorienting guitar solo (Lindsey Buckingham's work in the middle of Fleetwood Mac's "Go Your Own Way" is the single analogue in rock) that Pete Townshend has never since matched. No doubt this revelatory moment was omitted from the American version of My Generation because the Who's label thought those strange explosions were some sort of engineer's mistake (who knew what feedback was in 1966?); today they sound like the last echoes from a lost world.

One good source has told me Townshend now denies the solo ever existed. The weekly ads in the back pages of New Musical Express, offering bizarre prices for original copies of that first LP, attest that it did. Indeed, I have the record myself — I just played it, and the solo is still there — and no one will ever get it away from me. Has Townshend forgotten? Does he think he can rewrite history? Is this really what Meher Baba was talking about all those years?

Such objections aside, The Kids Are Alright, a double-album sound-track to the recently released documentary film, is an okay record. It's not the definitive Who collection — there have already been a few botched attempts at that — but a solid retrospective, very mainstream, with hardly a hint of the eccentricity that, at least in the early years, had as much to do with the group's identity as violence and noise. The Kids Are Alright lacks only excitement and surprise.

Most cuts come from concerts or TV programs. The set begins with a version of "My Generation" taken from The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (the emcee's intro is charmingly stupid, the performance foreshortened). There follow eighteen more tunes, some sandwiched into medleys. The finale is a live "Won't Get Fooled Again," complete with muddy sound and a very big scream from Roger Daltrey. The last number has become the most tiresome "anthem" of the decade, and the heat the band puts into it here doesn't rescue it from its own clichés: the political clichés that were there in the lyrics all along, or the musical ideas that have long since grown stale.

Low points include "Long Live Rock," which has not exactly grown with the years, and the inevitable Tommy side (saved — and shamed — by the much-boot-legged Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus version of "A Quick One"). High points include John Entwistle's indestructible "My Wife" and a Ready Steady Go! take (or lipsync?) of "Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere." "New" music consists of a snatch of "Roadrunner" and a medley squeeze of something called "My Generation Blues," which is not stunning.

Sorry — this is just not a knockout punch, or really any kind of statement. The reliance of The Kids Are Alright on the familiar and the enshrined makes the Who's career seem much more obvious than it was (before Tommy, it was mainly weird), and that distances an old fan. Despite (or because of) Keith Moon's death, I can't find it in my heart to feel very sentimental about the band. I still cherish the Who's ability to surprise the world, and I'm still waiting to find out what the next surprise will be.

David Bowie's albums are non events, though given the aura he insists on, they're halfheartedly presented as such: time and again, ideas are run up the flagpole, but try and find the flagpole. What's Bowie's point of reference. Is it just that he succeeded in replacing Marvin Gaye as rock's Peter O'Toole?. Is he man of mystery, or mystery-man manque?

The clue may be in the early years of the decade, when Hunky Dory, Bowie's last LP before he boarded the rocket ship to glory, was followed by the more glamorous but much narrower The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. On Hunky Dory, Bowie presented himself as a pure aesthete: smart, witty, sexually ambiguous, narcissistic and (with the chilling "Bewlay Brothers") ultimately resigned to the acute oblivion of the demimonde. On The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Bowie turned savior. He wrapped himself in the mantle of a Seventies Elvis, spun fantasies of doom and redemption, and set forth on his first American tour to reach out to the huddled pop masses. I'll never forget a night at Winterland, a San Francisco hall that holds a good 5000, when a lonely 400 of the faithful and the curious huddled in front of the stage — for warmth — as Bowie Ziggy struggled through his act, gamely crying: "You're not alone! Give me your hands! Give me your hands!"

Bowie promised far more than he delivered, but in those thin days, the promises themselves were exciting, and the music was strong enough to make the tension between Bowie's hype and his substance vital. Still, it wasn't long before Bowie's much-vaunted androgyny seemed more than anything an aspect of his compulsion to be all things to all pop people — in sequence, never simultaneously. He became "new" so regularly that his personality virtually ceased to exist. He made fine, nervous hard rock (Aladdin Sane): "retired" like some prematurely world-weary rock Sinatra; cut dark, rather bizarre disco (Young Americans); and appeared with black musicians as a sort of effete Tarzan. You always heard the persona before the music, which may be why Pin Ups, Bowie's terrific celebration of the British Invasion, is at once his most self-effacing and satisfying album. Never dull, but mythic only in his aspirations, Bowie became a bankable star.

At the same time, though — as if in retreat from a pale version of the triumph he'd sought, or perhaps frustrated at having been understood too easily and too well — Bowie was moving toward the pop avant-garde. On the one hand, he used his flair, brains and power to salvage the careers of fading prophets-without-honor: Mott the Hoople ("All the Young Dudes"), Lou Reed ("Walk on the Wild Side") and Iggy Pop (Raw Power, The Idiot, Lust for Life). On the other, he began to take his music away from the crowd, first with the experiments of Station to Station, then with the more abstract and distant Low and "Heroes", collaborations with Wunderkind Brian Eno and (on "Heroes") Robert Fripp, self-styled Man Ray of rock. The result was intriguing, honest, modern music, a smaller but perhaps smarter audience, and an enhanced and more complex image. If Bowie's work with punk heroes Mott the Hoople, Reed and Iggy made him a patron or even a source of that movement, his work with Eno and Fripp placed him ahead of it, the mainstream apostle of such post-punk English adventurers as prag Vec, Essential Logic and Throbbing Gristle, all of whom make minimalist, ironic, electronic pop-as-sound that grows straight from the artistic freedom and buzzing drone of the Sex Pistols.

Such a career has kept Bowie interesting, but through it all, the original points of reference remain visible: the savior and the aesthete. Bowie has never shied from pretentiousness; still, his pretensions — to grandeur, of course, but also to genius, wisdom, supermanship — have been thought out and musically supported. If he uses his body or his face as icons, he also makes his albums with a care that can only be called extreme. No matter how bloated or irrelevant his pose, the wit and resignation persist, just below the surface if not on it. The aesthete's narcissism has come to seem like a form of introspection — a means to will, knowledge, creativity.

Right at this point, then — the verge of the Eighties — Bowie should be ready for a major new move, or a major synthesis. He ought to be ready to confirm himself as he's never really done before. The momentum is there. Lodger might have been an event, if only as a record we would someday look back on as work that mapped the territory between past and future. Instead, it's just another LP, and one of his weakest at that: scattered, a footnote to "Heroes", an act of marking time.

"Fantastic Vovage" begins the set. It's anything but fantastic, and that's the point, because it's a song about the coming depression, general entropy, rampant criminality and vague resistance. It's singularly ill-written and musically empty; the horrors it means to summon up never coalesce into a threat.

One cut later, with "African Night Flight," we're in the heart of the Dark Continent, first stop on Lodger's inconclusive world tour (a last look before it all crumbles?). The jungle sounds are catchy enough, but the song itself doesn't catch. Then, with "Move On," the music takes off, if only for a moment.

"Move On" is a hilarious rewrite of Ricky Nelson's "Travelin' Man" (it touches down in Africa, Kyoto, Russia and Cyprus — rock travelers have become more sophisticated over the years), a wonderful parody of high-toned escapism (if Bowie's really "just a travelling man," as he claims, it's with luggage by Gucci) and an utterly stirring account of what it feels like to search beyond the borders of the life one has inherited. "Sometimes I feel," Bowie sings in a deep, terribly serious voice, "That I need to move on/So I pack a bag/And move on." He makes these intentionally flat, probably intentionally pompous lines seem noble, heroic. The voices that drift in and out of the background — seeking, saved, eternal voices — are patent magic, the voices not of those who need to move on, but of those who have long since arrived: voices from the other side.

After a stop in the Near East ("Yassassin," which is, we're informed, Turkish for "Long Live") and a sea cruise (the pounding "Red Sails," with its neat last chant: "The hinterland the hinterland We're gonna sail to the hinterland"), the first side closes. On side two, all pretense to theme drops away. There's "D.J.," which is dumb ("I am a D.J. I am what I play") but which disc jockeys love for obvious reasons, and then a melange of arch romanticism, unconvincing high despair and borrowed or emblematic images ("Look Back in Anger," "Red Money") that Bowie half-tries to develop before settling for coy obscurity. The music is mostly post Wild Honey Beach Boys with lots of oompah from the right and an equal dose of Fripperies and Enoisms from the left. The result is no more than irony: a tune like "Boys Keep Swinging" is so drenched in it ("Life is a pop of the cherry... They'll never clone va... Learn to drive and everything") that it ceases to have any meaning at all. The song even fails to achieve the meaning of pure pop meaninglessness, because it so obviously wants to mean something. Lodger tailspins right off the turntable.

Bowie's antinarrative lyrics, his antihero stance, his dependence on sounds and words that are suggestive rather than explicit, and his playing of banal surfaces against textures of real depth all speak for a future-in-the-present in which one must protect oneself from the world, from other people and from one's own visions, desires and fears — while at the same time giving all of those things form and weight. What is defined is the nature of the distance involved, its necessity and its risks. This is an aesthetic that, when it works, combines a retreat into art with an affirmation of the world one has retreated from; it's an aesthetic that holds life in reserve, and to hear it in action can be transporting. But on Lodger, save for "Move On," Bowie seems less than interested, neither a serious savior nor a serious aesthete. It's as if the role of savior now bores him, and thus — paradoxically, one would have thought years ago — leaves him without the energy to pursue his life as an aesthete with the intensity it demands. That's disturbing, because for David Bowie, life as an aesthete is not a role at all.

Nowadays, Jerry Lee Lewis is a respected country and western star, instant success following each release. Actually, he's always been country. But he hasn't always been such a well respected man.

These two albums of re-releases return us to the Fifties, when Jerry Lee was the Mick Jagger of his day. If his (for then) outlandishly long blond hair, wild clothing, and frenzied act didn't aggravate the public sufficiently, he made up for it in other ways. He married three times before his twenty-third birthday; the last marriage, to his thirteen year-old cousin, came before his second divorce was final and he found himself tossed out of England as a result. Headlining several of the late Alan Freed's cross-country rock circuses, he was crucified by the press. And when Dick Clark brought rock to prime time TV, Lewis was the opening night star. Singing "Great Balls of Fire" and "Breathless," the Pete Townshend of the piano discarded the stool, pounded the keys with his elbows, and transformed himself into a golden mass of perspiration. Jerry Lee was then at his peak, but the public wasn't ready for him, and he soon faded. His style, both on stage and off, was part of his downfall.

It's "Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano," as the labels of his old Sun 45s once boasted; a distinctive vocal style, a country sound, a crazed piano, a guitar break, an occasional sax. His biggest hits are here; "Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On," "Great Balls of Fire," "Breathless," and the equally good but lesser known "High School Confidential." They remain among the best examples of pure rock. The other numbers are straight C&W or rhythm and blues, all reflecting the musical flavor of the Fifties. We have a "Teen-Age Letter," a "Break-Up," and "Save the Last Dance for Me."

Many of the lyrics and arrangements are, of course, antiquated. People simply don't sing about "boppin' at the high school hop" or dancin' shoes anymore. And background "doo-wahs" are scarce today. Yet the result overshadows these distractions.

Lewis' voice, that slow southern drawl filled with power, urgency, sureness, and sexuality, is the same sort of voice that most of the early English groups tried to recreate, and it is still the voice of today. The white use of black pronunciation ("Great Balls of Fire," "Little Queenie") which Lewis carried on in true country tradition is now more common than ever. His fascination with boogie ("Lewis Boogie," "What'd I Say") reflects a knowledge of a form that many people today feel they have just uncovered.

"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On" and "Great Balls of Fire" speak for themselvies as Lewis' own contribution to the permanent history of rock, and "High School Confidential" is beautiful. Here he is, ordering his woman to open her door and get her dancing shoes before the juke box blows a fuse. The music stops, he sings; it stops, he sings. The song is so fast it stuns, the voice so urgent it spells emergency. So what if they're going to a high school hop? It could be anywhere, and it could be any fuse getting ready to blow. He also does Chuck Berry's "Little Queenie" and Barrett Strong's "Money," long before the English "discovered" them for white audiences. Jerry Lee knew back when.

Again, while millions are only now finding country music, Lewis always knew it. The C&W numbers also show shapes of things to come, as well as what had been. "Move on Down the Line" reminds me of the putdown songs of the Stones. "Fools Like Me" and "I'll Make it All Up to You" are country, but like much country, they are also the blues. And everyone tries his hand at the blues today. Especially with Hank Williams' "You Win Again" do we see why Lewis is a top country figure today. The music is not as smooth as country's Top Forty, nor is the singing. But the beginnings are there, the feeling if you want to get corny.

For me, however, "Breathless" remains his masterpiece. The piano is pumping, the voice is raw Louisiana, and only the tired adjective "frantic" can describe the song's total effect. The gasp for air each time he confesses he's breathless, the substitution of squeals and groans for words, the half-talk, half-sing style; everything is perfect. There is a bit of "Breathless" in most good rock today. Only the "good-ness grac-ci-ous" of "Great Balls of Fire" matches the creativity of this song.

Lewis is not a great singer, a great musician, nor does he write much. He is a great interpreter. He takes the words and the music that others have put on paper and makes them his. Not many of today's groups have this ability. The best write their own material. The others don't last very long. It is this ability that makes "Breathless," "Great Balls of Fire," and "Whole Lotta Shakin'" great.

Like a few of the other rock stars of his time, like Presley, the Everlys, and Roy Orbison, he unwittingly foresaw the future. The forecasting is one of the remarkable aspects of these albums. His rock numbers still stand up. His country flavor is again the big thing. The blues, the boogie, the monologue; it's all here. Those who saw him in the earlier days will recall one of rock's wildest, yet best performers. A wild white singer, Mick Jagger with a piano. Those who never saw him can visualize it all by listening to these numbers, songs running from self-pity to gloating overbearance to simple statements of fact. And Jerry Lee was a revolutionary before it became fashionable. He just did what he thought was right.

A few of the songs on the albums are truly great. Most of them are good. There are a few duds, which is remarkable considering that Sun probably scrounged through their files to find enough material for the set.

Lewis is now enjoying a revival among rock listeners as well as among country fans, but he's only doing what he's always done; a bit more subdued, but basically the same thing. Hearing these albums won't conjure up visions of him singing "What Made Milwaukee Famous Has Made a Loser Out of Me." But it's so very easy to close your eyes and be back in the balcony of the Brooklyn Fox seeing Alan Freed introduce the one and only Jerry Lee Lewis.

Graham Parker's first two albums remain among the very finest of the decade: lyrical, intense, emotionally specific; a rough and untrained voice somehow merging perfectly with the Anglicized Blonde on Blonde /Stax-Volt classicism of the band. It was a signal debut; Howlin Wind and Heat Treatment both arriving in 1976 along with a string of Let's-Conquer-the-U.S.A. club dates. Then Parker and the Rumour had to deal with commercial success, or rather the lack of it: to find themselves an audience or else face a foreclosed future of second-on-the-bill, short-term contracts and premature breakup, their best music perhaps ahead of them and out of reach.

Things did not work out. Englishpunk — which Parker had anticipated with his working-class fury, if not his style — appeared, and made him seem irrelevant, or, worse, tame. Elvis Costello (who, when I first heard him, sounded to me like a hoax that Parker and his sometime producer Nick Lowe had thought up in an inspired moment) emerged with music and an image that could at once take off from punk and escape its enemies. More obsessed, savvy and marketable than Parker, Costello absorbed the few fans Parker had won and leaped right over him. And on its own terms, Parker's career stopped cold. Stick to Me, out in late 1977, featured a narrow, grating sound that made it almost impossible to listen to; determined to get out of his U.S. contract with Mercury, Parker followed with a bad live LP. The strategy worked, but whether Parker would be able to pull himself out of the hole he'd felt forced to dig was another question.

Squeezing Out Sparks, produced by former Phil Spector arranger Jack "Lonely Surfer" Nitzsche, lets you hear what Parker was after on Stick to Me, for it's made in the same vein, though this time the music is full of presence: turn the record up and it gets more exciting, not more shrill. In 1977, Graham Parker and the Rumour were reaching for the harshest edge in their music, and that's what they offer here. They've put aside the grandeur and the richness — horns, keyboards and the romantic pessimism — of the first two albums in favor of fuzz tone, fast tempos, hard drumming and desperate, even paranoid singing. The proof of the band's depth is that this approach is most successful at its most extreme.

"Nobody Hurts You" (harder than yourself, says the chorus) hits first, and does not wear out. The authority in Parker's voice — the way he commands your attention — and the momentum in Brinsley Schwarz' guitar playing can take your breath away. You can't tell if the song was written around Schwarz' riff — a searing, muscular attack that carries Parker past himself again and again — or if Schwarz pulled the riff out of something Parker showed him, be it melody or Parker's attack, but that riff is so strong and distinctive the band finally steps back and simply lets Schwarz take the song. Parker mutters in the corners as the track turns into an affirmation of emotion itself. As with so many of Parker's best tunes, the lyric is about refusal: refusal to be pinned down, trapped, ambushed, humiliated, obscured. Parker just strings together situations he must get out of, and when he at last puts his finger on the truth and the whole band crashes down on:

LOOK!
No one's going to
Illuminate you
All the odds are
Stacked against you

you believe every line, your back against the wall.

This performance needs no time to grow on a listener; others may. "Passion Is No Ordinary Word," "Local Girls," "Protection" and "Don't Get Excited" are all good tracks ("Saturday Nite Is Dead" and "Waiting for the UFO's" are not good at all), but most betray a kind of rhythmic uncertainty, a doubt about where to take the tune that's too often covered over by mannered cries from Parker that fail to grab hold. "You Can't Be Too Strong" is a tougher problem. As with the other cuts mentioned, it means to define the vision Parker is offering, a vision that might be more compelling on Squeezing Out Sparks than on earlier records: the belief that, as F. Scott Fitzgerald put it, "life is essentially a cheat"; that penetrating to the source of one's emotions is necessary to a decent life but not a guarantee of it (nothing is); that struggle, not happiness, is what life is all about. But Parker has never tried to apply that vision to a subject as difficult as that in question here.

"You Can't Be Too Strong" is about an abortion. Sung with force and accompanied acoustically, it's a (perhaps too obviously) stark, personal statement. Well, when it comes to right-to-life rock, I prefer the "FUCKING BLOODY MESS!" of the Sex Pistols' "Bodies": Graham Parker's response to the same sexual and political fact is to sentimentalize his one-man-against-the-world stance, almost to prettify it. The thing is, see, this girl he got pregnant just wasn't strong enough to have the baby; the doctor wasn't strong enough to refuse to perform the operation. And so, out of weakness, they surrender to murder, or anyway a cheapening of life — and cheapening of life is indeed what Parker fights against. But the received, moralistic qualities of the performance — Parker's choice of folkish tone and music no less than his words — call the strength of his vision into question. The woman in this song is less the bearer of a child than the bearer of an issue; she's merely weak, not someone given enough life to be a real challenge to Parker's vision, and thus give it life. And that's cheap.

But Parker's vision is worth questioning; that of most performers is not. "Discovering Japan," the first cut on Squeezing Out Sparks and the number that best speaks for the album, rams home Parker's music-as-way-of-life by reducing it to a demand for meaning, for the fleeting revelations through which one makes sense of the world. This is a lyrically confusing and musically undeniable account of flight, of an adventure that seems more like an escape. It's as explosive a piece of rock & roll as we are likely to hear this year.

Parker takes off on a jet for the land of cherry blossoms and Hiroshima, and when he confronts the time change — "My watch says 8:02 /But that's midnight to you" — he somehow makes that tiny fact seem as threatening and dangerous as the sudden memory of a murder he committed in his sleep. Images of American occupation and Tokyo street life clash and seem to go nowhere. You have only the pace of the song to carry you along, but with guitar from Schwarz on the order of the budda-budda-buddas that used to punctuate Sgt. Fury comic books, you don't stop to think. The sense of final adversity, of the need for emotional release and for some kind of clarity, hits with more power than anywhere else on the record. This song is struggle. When Parker leaps out of the chaos he's created, with a glimmer of displaced, fragmented insight:

But lovers turn to posers
Show up in film exposures
Just like in travel brochures
Discovering Japan!

you may not be able to figure out why those words end the song so perfectly, why they suddenly make emotional, not rational sense out of the fantasized quest the track now seems to have been all along, but you will be caught up in Parker's refusal of whatever it is life has in store for him.

Squeezing Out Sparks is no landmark. If you're looking for an LP with the coherence and weight of Bruce Springsteen's Darkness on the Edge of Town, you may be disappointed. The album, rather, is one chapter in the story Graham Parker and the Rumour are telling — a tale sometimes subverted by weaknesses of nerve, imagination or craft, a tale of true fear and drama. It's often been said that the work of those artists we most care about becomes part of our own autobiographies. Such work allows us to understand our own successes and failures. This has been true of the music of Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Jimi Hendrix, Rod Stewart, Sly Stone, Janis Joplin — all people who have, at considerable risk, exposed themselves and allowed others to understand how little they were holding back, and thus allowed others to respond in kind. Whatever the flaws of Squeezing Out Sparks, this remains true of Graham Parker.

The Clash rain fire and brimstone — with a laugh. Give' Em Enough Rope, their second album (The Clash, released in the U.K. in 1977, remains unissued here, as do several remarkable singles that appear on neither LP), is a rocker's assault on the Real World in the grand tradition of Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed and Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols.

Produced by Sandy Pearlman, an American brought in by CBS and who's best known for his sometimes muddy work with Blue Öyster Cult, Give' Em Enough Rope's sound seems suppressed: the highs aren't there, and the presence of the band is thinner than it ought to be. The record doesn't jump. But the producer's concept comes through — accessible hard rock — and nothing has been gussied up. The Clash's attack is still fast and noisy (straight English punk), but with lyrical accents cracking the rough surface (straight English punk with a grip on the future). The band's vision of public life — the sense that there's more to life than pleasure and safety — is uncompromised, and so is the humor that keeps that vision from degenerating into a set of slogans, that keeps it full of questions and honest doubt. Imagine the Who's "I Can't Explain" as a statement about a world in flames, not a lover's daze, and you've got the idea.

Formed just after the emergence of the Sex Pistols, the Clash, from their first gigs, were second only to Rotten & Company as punk headmen. Where the Pistols pursued nihilism, the Clash affirmed rebellion; if Johnny Rotten really did sound like the Antichrist, Clash lead singer Joe Strummer railed in the voice of a streetfighter. It wasn't Armageddon he called up, simply the next battle. The point of the Clash's early "London's Burning" wasn't just to cheer the fire. Despite the thoughtfulness that had to go into "White Riot" and a cover of Junior Murvin's reggae hit, "Police and Thieves" — both cut in 1977 as attempts at solidarity with the angry West Indians of England's slums — there was a certain intentional dumbness to the Clash's style: a way of saying they knew no more than anyone else, but it hadn't stopped them from stepping out to take the heat and give it back. They defined punk populism — they made it sound at once like a test of valor and a real good time.

Today, in England, the Clash are something of a myth: perhaps the last band to promise that something other than the fate of their own career is hanging on a new release. Give 'Em Enough Rope entered the U.K. charts at Number Two. Though a sniveling backlash has hit them in the British pop press, there's no question that a lot of hopes, symbolic and otherwise, are riding on the group: If the album sells, does that mean the spirit is there to make society change a little faster? If the album is good, does that mean life will be a little richer? In the U.S.A., the Clash remain no more than a potent rumor — wary of the Sex Pistols' fate, yet intrigued with the possibility of turning what they see as a moribund scene around.

Give 'Em Enough Rope is a confident piece of music. The storm begins with the first note and lets up only in snatches. The reality the Clash convey is that of a world upside down, a world in which no one can be sure of where they stand. Lines are drawn between oppressors and victims, killers and targets, but it isn't meant to be clear who's who, and there's not a hint of self-righteousness, of political purity. What you hear in the clatter of guitars (the Yardbirds passed through Captain Beefheart, reggae and Mott the Hoople, all anchored by a big beat) is a reach for drama and passion: the Clash are out to catch the most dangerous moods and fantasies of their time, not to stake out a position. Their field of action — on a rock & roll record, a fantasy in itself — is the world. The terrorists of "Guns on the Roof" could be, are, anywhere; the out-of-step march of "English Civil War" is based on "When Johnny Comes Marching Home," a song from the American Civil War, and it's a prophecy that has nothing to do with borders.

The LP begins with its most spectacular cut, "Safe European Home," a furious and funny account of a trip Joe Strummer and Clash lead guitarist Mick Jones (who, with Strummer, writes the songs) made to Jamaica. What might have been a nice Patti Smith-style ode to Rasta Consciousness ("Jah speak to me, too, man — uh, mon?") turns out instead to be a hard-rock version of 10cc's "Dreadlock Holiday." Would-be soul brothers Strummer and Jones report back from "a place where every white face was an invitation to robbery," where Natty Dread is drinking at the bar in the Sheraton Hotel. They looked for Bob Marley's punky reggae party (he even sent them an invitation!), but no one knew where it was, and Bob was out of town. The feeling of displacement is hilarious, but what makes the song more than a good joke on the Clash, what tosses you right into the middle of it, is the pure power of the performance: Strummer's outraged and self-mocking vocals, Jones' wonderfully sardonic chorus ("Where'd you go?" he keeps asking Strummer) and the careening caterwaul of the band. The music pushes harder and harder, and finally the two Englishmen flee — right back to their safe European home, to the safety of a land where Jamaicans are treated with the same scorn Strummer and Jones were offered in Jamaica. And then "English Civil War" kicks off, and home is a crueler joke than paradise.

Give 'Em Enough Rope moves strikingly — from heroic fanfares ("Drug Stabbing Time") to an almost wistful look back on adolescence and the different paths friends took ("Stay Free," with a lovely Keith Richards-like vocal from Mick Jones) to pure fear ("Guns on the Roof") to a good slap back at an audience that won't allow a band a false step ("Cheapskate"). Amid all the force and momentum, melodies slip through, are buried, surface again. Lyrics peak out and disappear just as you're sure you've made them out, as they did on "Brown Sugar" or any Stones 45. The tracks grow with each listening; after a week with the record, you only think you know what's on it.

As one tune after another kicks in — as you find yourself rooting for the political killers (Left? Right?) in "Guns on the Roof" and then running from them; cheering the Jamaicans in "Safe European Home" and then feeling nervous; fitting yourself into Jones' gang in "Stay Free" and then realizing why he had to leave it behind — the basic theme of the album becomes clear. Stated in a dozen different ways by Mick Jones' guitar (the pulse of "Tommy Gun," the "I Can't Explain" riff in "Guns on the Roof," the soaring opening lines of "Cheapskate") and driven home by Joe Strummer's singing (blasted in "English Civil War," possessed in "Guns on the Roof," amused in "Julie's in the Drug Squad"), the theme is that of making choices in a world organized to close choices off. When Jones bids his pals a final goodbye with the simple admonition. "Stay free," the line hurts: you know the odds are they'll never make it — and that he might not make it, and that you might not. The chances of finding the right choices may be slim at best; the odds of being wrong if you don't choose at all are 100 percent.

Whatever the Clash are after, it isn't peace of mind. Give 'Em Enough Rope means to sound like trouble, not a meditation on it. The band's vision of a world strangling on its own contradictions hasn't changed, but their idea of their place in that world has. The sleeve of Junior Murvin's Police and Thieves (which must have inspired the Clash) showed cops and robbers in a snake dance, picking each other's pockets; the back cover of The Clash was a shot of London's riot squad rioting. The contradiction perceived here was one a primitive rebel would catch: the authorities weren't just bent, they were backwards. Give 'em enough rope, and they'd hang themselves.

Today, with the Sex Pistols gone, the punk movement scattered and rebellion receding, the contradictions buried in 1977's ideology of righteousness have emerged. Despite Bob Marley's seal of approval, a good reggae collection and a long and noble stand against Britain's send-the-blacks-back-where-they-came-from National Front, the Clash were brought up short by those contradictions in Jamaica. Whatever sympathy they might feel for terrorism isn't going to do them any good when a bullet picks them out of a crowd. If the possibility of a final crunch seems more real than it ever did, the prospect of Blood running in the streets is no longer romantic: "You'll be dead." Strummer mutters, if one can mutter a shout: "The war is won." Sure, "give 'em enough rope" is still partly a brag — time is on our side, and all that. But there's an unbroken sense of uncertainty on this record, an uncertainty that at times shades into panic, and those emotions are a lot truer than a brag is to the stories we have to read in the papers, and read in the eves of our friends.

The punks didn't cease power. But they did seize create — a measure of freedom, the chance to make choices that weren't even there before. That means the punks too — the Clash among them — now have enough rope: they no longer live in a world they never made.

eith Moon was not the first rock & roll drummer to be celebrated by large numbers of people: thanks to his personality and his doleful eyes, Ringo Starr took that prize. But Moon was the first to be so celebrated as a drummer. Right from the beginning, as a seventeen-year-old who could have passed for fifteen without trouble. Moon trashed the limits that the best of his contemporaries – Charlie Watts, Hal Blaine, Kenny Buttrey – instinctively respected. There seemed to be no conscious arrogance or musical ambition involved: Moon simply didn't recognize those limits. He didn't hear them, so he didn't play them.

Like Buddy Holly, Jackie Wilson, Keith Richards or Pete Townshend – but, more than anyone, like Little Richard – Keith Moon was a natural, a rock & roll original, one of a handful of performers who seized possibilities in the music that others had not merely ignored, but had never perceived at all. Listen to Hal Blaine's work on the Ronettes' "Be My Baby" or Jan and Dean's "Dead Man's Curve" – work that directly inspired Moon – and listen to what Moon made of it in "The Kids Are Alright," "Anyway Anyhow Anywhere" or "My Generation": the connection is there, but it is not remotely implicit. There's an inexplicable leap, a missing link, involved – and it's the presence of that missing link that proves Moon's greatness. His triumphs can be described, they can be analyzed, but they can't be traced. Like all rock & roll originals, Moon sounded as if he came out of nowhere to take over the world.

Keith Moon Bites Back

Clearly, when Keith Moon arrived in 1964 to complete the Who, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle and Pete Townshend recognized that they had a giant on their hands. Until the release of The Who Sell Out in 1967 (when Townshend's visionary epics began to dominate the group's records and demand a quieter, more ethereal sound), the band's best singles and album tracks not only featured Moon, they were built around him. (This was true as well on The Who Sell Out's most powerful cut, "I Can See for Miles.")

As Jon Landau pointed out years ago, it was Moon who played the parts conventionally given over to the lead guitar: on My Generation, the Who's first album, Townshend takes his cues from Moon, most often coming down on Moon's licks to emphasize them, when previously the rules of rock & roll had always dictated that it be the other way around. Even Townshend's most spectacular early solo, in "The Kids Are Alright" (criminally cut by three-fourths on all American versions), takes off from patterns Moon establishes early in the song – and which he extends in front of Townshend – before hurling the band out of the instrumental break with one of the most sublime drum rolls in all of rock. "Happy Jack," a lovely lyric aside, belongs to Moon: even the group vocals are orchestrated around him.

No drummer in a true rock & roll band has ever been given – has ever seized, perhaps – as much space and presence as Moon used in those first years, likely because no other drummer has been able to carry the weight. Discussions of Moon have always focused on his drive, his force, but while the momentum he generated remains untouched, what I now hear in his sound is richness. Though his work was always preternturally elaborate and complex – the addition of a second drummer by the Allman Brothers or the Grateful Dead should have been taken as something of a joke, and a tame one at that: Moon played like four drummers – he was never busy, ornamental or meretricious. It was a question of power, surely, but that power had its parts: astonishing timing (Moon's violent punctuation of Daltrey's stutter all through "My Generation"), unaccompanied loudness (the six tiny shots, heard as two cracks from a rifle, that break up "I know what it means but – can't explain" on the Who's first single) and, most of all, a profoundly vivid imagination, an ability to hear – and then play – what no one had heard before. And because Moon, a genius if any musician in rock deserves the name, arrived in the Who fullgrown, he gave the rest of the band, Townshend in particular, the freedom to grow. He was their line to the source.

Moon's influence, of course, was unparalleled, but it was also shallow. After Keith Moon drumming on rock records became stronger, was mixed higher: kits became bigger, and lots of people knocked their sets around onstage. Moon was an inspiration to countless drummers, but he couldn't really be imitated. Few were good enough to learn from him: Ringo Starr's "breakthrough" on "Ticket to Ride" (and for Ringo it was a breakthrough, though for Moon it would have been a collapse) was as far as most could go down his road. Perhaps only Mickey Waller, shaking Rod Stewart's "Every Picture Tells a Story" to its roots, captured more than a little of Moon's holy brashness: his revolt.

The Who Come to a Fork in the Road

It is really the Who's early years that tell Moon's tale, and it's on the first records – most of them collected on Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bouncy – that he left his mark. His playing on Tommy and Who's Next is brilliant, but almost as conventional as the approbation; not many could match what Moon did on those records, but he was not matching himself. Musically, the Who's records were no longer his. Physically and mentally, he was no longer whole.

Today, one hears less of Moon's sound in rock & roll than the muffled flumpf of L.A. studio drummers. Compared to the humor and the verve of what Moon did on "I'm a Boy," "Can't Explain" or "I Can See for Miles," it is the sound of stupidity, of retreat, of coldness. Keith Moon was a man of terrible, destructive passion; for a time, he organized it all into his music. When I listen now, the records he left behind make him sound like more than the best drummer in rock & roll history, which he quite obviously was. They make him sound like the only one.

his is by no means a great record, but despite the doubt, guilt, worry and self-laceration in almost every song, it's a strangely confident one. Again and again, the persona is that of the cripple, the victim of disaster, but Who Are You is not the work of cripples, no matter how many breakdowns and bottles the Who have left on their fourteen-year-old trail.

Certainly, the album kicks in slowly. The tunes lack a natural, kinetic groove (John Entwistle's "905" and Pete Townshend's "Who Are You" are exceptions). The drive we expect from the Who is replaced by chunky, sometimes clunky orchestration: strings, horns, synthesizer music. This gives one the feeling that the Who aren't moving, that they aren't gearing up for a great rock & roll shoot-out with the competition, heading off for better times, claiming the future — rather, they're face to face with limbo, and trying to think their way out of it. They make the limbo real, but their resistance to it is just as convincing.

At least four songs — all Pete Townshend's — begin with the premise that the band's (and its audience's) future can't be taken for granted: with doors slamming all around, Townshend feels his weakness, his obsolescence. "New Song," the first cut, rams home the guilt of having taken a free ride: "I write the same old song, with a few new lines/And everybody wants to cheer me." "Music Must Change" might be announcing the need for a New Wave, but it's quite consciously two years out of date, and, what's more, the music itself sounds old and stiff — there's not a single musical concession to punk, reggae or even hard-nosed rock. In "Guitar and Pen," Townshend clings to his vocation as the man who has something to say, something worth the time others will take to listen, but very intentionally, he protests too much, and subverts his own affirmation.

And then there is "Who Are You," a far stronger single than "Squeeze Box," the hit from 1975's The Who by Numbers, and a song that, stretched out over more than six minutes on the LP version, is far more moving than "Won't Get Fooled Again," the band's certified Seventies masterpiece. The dynamics are much more subtle this time — and all the smugness is gone.

"Who Are You" was spun out of the night that Townshend, already drunk after hours of financial haggling, half-recognized two members of the Sex Pistols in a bar: that is, he thought either Steve Jones or Paul Cook was Johnny Rotten. Corrected, he felt even more confused: Why can't I see straight? Cook and Jones, supposedly arrogant young punks working out their rock & roll Oedipal complex, were thrilled to meet Townshend and horrified at what he had to tell them: the Who were finished, used up, wasted. The incident left Townshend passed out in a Soho street, which is where the song begins. Townshend (in the voice of Roger Daltrey) wakes up with one enormous question: Who are you? It's addressed to Cook and Jones (Who are these upstarts, who would never have played a note had not Townshend picked up a guitar more than a decade back?); to the cop who, recognizing Townshend, sends him home without a bust (Who are the fans?); to himself (What does it mean to be a rocker? What kind of wreck has the life made him?); and, finally, to anyone who's listening. "Whooooooo/Are you?" hums the chorus. "I really want to know!" Daltrey shouts back, echoing Donovan's "What Goes On," but while Donovan communicated hippie certainty that all things would come, Daltrey is desperate, sure of nothing.

Attention, reads a sticker on the album cover: "'Who Are You' (Side 2, Track 4) contains lyrics that may offend." We can thank the Supreme Court — which in its ultimate wisdom recently granted the FCC the power to censor radio — for that one, but what might these offensive lyrics be? There's a lot of emotion in this song — is that now illegal? I had to listen over and over before I caught what the sticker was referring to: Daltrey's most expressive singing on the LP — a blasted, tired, buried wail of "Who the fuck are you!" just before the record ends. Nobody answers: the doo-wop chorus simply goes on taunting. The neat double meaning of the album title — the Who are you — does not outlast the title song.

The other numbers on the LP, those that don't posit rock as a metaphor for life, connect directly with those that do: they too are about fear, emptiness, failure. John Entwistle's "905" is surely the finest cut here, a return to the form of "Boris the Spider," "Whiskey Man" and "My Wife." The timeliness of the song is uncanny: it's about a test-tube baby. The music, led on by an eerie, climbing riff, sets a science-fiction mood — a mood that's all the more unsettling since the story is no longer quite science fiction. Entwistle's vocal is perfect: lost, damned, accepting. "In suspended animation," he says quietly, "My childhood passed me by/If I speak without emotion/Then you know the reason why." His hardest lines, "Every sentence in my head/Someone else has said," bounce off Townshend's admission in "New Song" that he has nothing to say that he hasn't said before: cloning may be the promise of the future, but the Who are afraid they can enter the future (i.e., this year) only by cloning themselves.

The boozy stumblebum of "Who Are You" turns up again in Entwistle's "Trick of the Light": this time it's sex that has pulled the rug out from under the singer, as he begs the prostitute he's hired for the night to reassure him about his performance in bed. In "Had Enough," the singer tries to get mad — "I've had enough of being nice," he chants at the beginning; "Here comes the end of the world," he yells as the tune ends — but he can't do it. The song limps, the singer fades. If this is anger, if this is the end of the world, no one has anything to be afraid of.

Who Are You is an LP the Who have been working toward all through the Seventies. The fears of aging, irrelevancy and the dissolution of one's self, one's band or one's audience that peeked out of Who's Next and The Who by Numbers have finally surfaced whole. The album cover emphasizes the story. Keith Moon, unstable, unreliable, sits in a chair. marked "Not to Be Taken Away." Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend look very old. Townshend, in fact, looks much older than he is: in this picture, he could pass for fifty. And yet there is nothing pathetic about the record he and his band have made. Time seems to be a challenge that's left them invigorated, eager to get on with their lives — which is to say, eager to get on with rock & roll. Townshend's wit, his intelligence, is still running wild, in the many interviews that have appeared recently as well as on this LP. Entwistle's work is his best in years. Daltrey's voice has hardened — there are whole realms of feeling no longer accessible to him — but he's learning how to use that hardness to convey troubles the earlier songs couldn't reach. Only Moon truly seems to have lost most of what he had: his last great moment came on "Behind Blue Eyes," and since then he has done little more than keep the beat.

It will be a real disappointment if another three years pass before the next Who album: this one seems to have left them ready for the new music they claim they can't make — a claim that's obviated by what is new and, more importantly, compelling on Who Are You. I said this was, despite its claims to oblivion, a confident record: what makes it so is the Who's refusal to settle for mere "survival," for automatic applause and meaningless pro forma hits. Pete Townshend recognizes the fact that, after a decade which seemed happy with its own dead end, bands like the Clash have broken through limits he had half-accepted. In this case, the child really is father to the man, and that means the chance to start all over again is at Townshend's finger tips.

t saddens me that I can't find it in my heart to agree with my colleague Dave Marsh that Bob Dylan's new record is a joke, or anyway a good one. Most of the stuff here is dead air, or close to it. The novelty of the music — soul chorus backup (modeled on Bob Marley's I-Threes), funk riffs from the band, lots of laconic sax work — quickly fades as one realizes how indifferent the playing is: "Señor (Tales of Yankee Power)," the most musically striking number here, is really just a pastiche of the best moments of the Eagles' Hotel California. Still, I believe some of the songs on Street Legal: those that are too bad to have been intended with anything but complete seriousness. Dylan may have once needed a dump truck to unload his head, but you'd need a Geiger counter to find irony in "Is Your Love in Vain?" or affection in "Baby Stop Crying."

Both are wretched performances, but the former is particularly cruel: compared to Dylan's posture here, Mick Jagger in "Under My Thumb" is exploring the outer reaches of humility. Not that there's any bite in the song, as there is in "On the Road Again" or "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right," two other Dylan numbers in which a woman gets what the singer thinks she has coming to her. There's too much distance here for that — distance between an ego and its object. The man speaks to the woman like a sultan checking out a promising servant girl for VD, and his tone is enough to make her fake the pox if that's what it takes to get away clean. When, after a string of gulf-between-the sexes insults (which pretty much come down to, Are you good enough for me?/I'm hot stuff, you know), the singer finally makes the big concession ("Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you" — odd notion of how falling in love works), you can almost see the poor girl heading for the exit. "Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow," the man mouths, apparently making a dumb leap from housewife to earth mother, but in truth just rhyming. Then comes the kicker: "Can you understand my pain?" Women all over America must be saying what a friend of mine said: "Sure, Bob, give me a call sometime. If I'm not home, leave a message on the answer-phone." As it happens, "Is Your Love in Vain?" is a high point on Street Legal — or, at least, the most emotionally convincing track on the album. No joke.

Ah, but the singing! The singing, which on other records has redeemed lines nearly as terrible as those I've quoted — what about the singing? Well, Bob Dylan has sounded sillier than he does on Street Legal (who could forget "Big Yellow Taxi"), more uncomfortable ("The Boxer") and as disinterested ("Let It Be Me"), but he's never sounded so utterly fake. Though this quality is sometimes cut with playfulness ("Changing of the Guards"), in "Baby Stop Crying," the vocal is so fey, so intolerably smug, that the only reference point is one of those endless spoken intros Barry White was using a few years ago: an imitation of caring that couldn't fool a stuffed dog. Dave Marsh is right when he says there are echoes of Elvis on Street Legal — "Is Your Love in Vain?" plays with the melody of "Can't Help Falling in Love" before it turns into "Here Comes the Bride" — but not even "There's No Room to Rhumba in a Sports Car" was quite this creepy.

While most of the singing on Street Legal (the pronunciamentos of "No Time to Think," for example: "Loyalty, unity/Epitome, rigidity") falls short of creepiness, it's simply impossible to pay attention to it for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Why should this be, when again and again — especially during those times, such as before the release of Blood on the Tracks, when both his fans and detractors had written him off — Dylan has proved himself as expressive and inventive as any singer in American music? I don't know the answer, but merely not giving a damn whether a record is good enough for his audience might be a big part of the problem. But I also think that the near-constant touring Dylan has done since 1974 (all that raw chanting in big halls, all that gruff railing over the band) has at once produced a new vocal style, and destroyed Dylan's timing and his ability to bring emotional precision to a lyric. In the singing style Dylan is using now, emotion has been replaced by mannerism, subtlety by a straining to be heard.

His word-to-word emphasis, when it isn't pure hokum, is patently random; thus, the good lines come off no better than the bad. Dylan has always written throwaway lines as a necessary means to setting up the line he's put his heart into, but when he sang, he'd toss off the throwaways, bury them, and then rush back with everything he had. What he was really setting up was an ambush for the listener — that's a lot of what "Like a Rolling Stone" is about. There are no such dynamics here. With little or no sense of rhythm in the singing, you can't stay with the music; either it becomes an irritant (and the stiff female choruses Dylan uses all over Street Legal only compound the irritation), or you just stop hearing anything.

There have been bad Dylan albums before, of course; but Self Portrait had "Copper Kettle," New Morning "Sign on the Window" and "Went to See the Gypsy," Planet Waves "Wedding Song" and Desire "Sara." The collapse of Dylan's timing insures that there are no such odd gems on Street Legal. Timing can spark an ordinary lyric with genius or a pedestrian arrangement with magic; no one who has heard Dylan mutter "All right!" in "Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence" or push the Hawks through the 1966 Albert Hall version of "Baby Let Me Follow You Down" can doubt his flair for devastatingly idiosyncratic rhythm. On "Get Your Rocks Off!," one of the unreleased Basement Tapes performances, he even laughs in time — or makes the rhythm re-create itself around his laugh. On the new record, the only hint of decent singing comes in the first four verses of "New Pony" — and it's the sort of blues Dylan can sing in his sleep, and probably does.

The most interesting — if that's the word — aspect of Street Legal is its lyrics, which often pretend to the supposed impenetrability of Dylan's mid-Sixties albums, the albums on which his reputation still rests. But the return is false; you may not have known why Dylan was singing about a "Panamanian moon" in "Memphis Blues Again" (or, for that matter, have had any idea why the blues were Memphian rather than Bostonian), but you knew what "Your debutante just knows what you need/But I know what you want" meant, and it meant a lot. In Street Legal's "Señor (Tales of Yankee Power)" — the parenthetical part of the title is the most inspired thing on the record — the lines, "Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled/Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field," are just a gesture, just a wave at the fans. Not that the effect of the lines can't hurt: it's hard not to hear the older songs now in terms of the new numbers that appear to resemble them, and then conclude that at bottom "Absolutely Sweet Marie" and "Highway 61 Revisited" are as empty as "Where Are You Tonight? (Journey through Dark Heat)," even though that isn't remotely true.

I mean, if I want a joke, I'll listen to Steve Martin sing "King Tut." That line, "He gave his life for tourism," is really funny.

Dion's new album opens with a house-rocking version of Tom Waits' "Heart of Saturday Night," and Dion rings the bell twelve times: every note hits home. Fittingly, the title of this record implies something more than just another step on the endless comeback trail of the Fifties hero (the comeback that, by the nature of how rock & roll history is made, will always fall short): Return of the Wanderer means a return to form, not simply an escape from obscurity. Dion may never again define rock & roll, as he did in 1958 with "I Wonder Why" and in 1961 with "Runaround Sue," but he can still make himself heard.

Like Bob Seger's Night Moves, Return of the Wanderer is one man's attempt to keep faith with his past without being trapped by it. Inevitably, there's a good deal of sentimentality here. "I used to be a Brooklyn Dodger," Dion sings of his punk days in the Bronx, "but I'm not a hitter anymore" — well, we know that claim is sentimental because on "Heart of Saturday Night," Dion is a hitter. Sentiment, or self-pity, does bleed the life out of a few love songs, and out of Dion's covers of Bob Dylan's "Spanish Harlem Incident" and the Lovin' Spoonful's "Do You Believe in Magic": his attack is so vague, so fainthearted. we lose all sense that a singer is making a claim on our attention. The musicians hold back, where on that first cut they explode.

The centerpiece of Return of the Wanderer ("The Wanderer" was a Number Two hit for Dion in 1961; in his novel The Wanderers, Richard Price has an early Sixties New York teenage gang name themselves after the tune) is the stunning "Midtown American Main Street Gang," a six-minute scenario of the days before Dion traded in his leather jacket for a mohair suit. "I feared the friends I ran with," Dion begins, "but I loved to live the role." The whole song is in the tension of that line.

Dion's singing on the verses — which describe what he and four buddies tried to make of life in the mid-Fifties, and what life made of them (a forced marriage, the Army, prison, and for Dion, fame and heroin) — sounds distant at first, almost effete. But the rumble of the chorus is full of thrills, and it rescues the story and the song from cliché. What we hear is hard, brittle, transporting. Fighting the guitar and sax for space, the backup singers send out rough doo-wops (Do do do do doot — day oh!) that connect the song to the past without imitating it, Lords of Flatbush-style. It's the best moment of the piece, until Dion tops it by cutting loose with the biggest, freest wails he's hit since "Lovers Who Wander."

Shooting for the movie version of The Wanderers begins in September. If director Phil Kaufman knows his stuff, "Midtown American Main Street Gang," which dovetails almost exactly with Richard Price's story, will be there on the soundtrack, right under the credits. But since you never can tell, you never should wait.


In rock & roll, nothing seems easier or more obvious than a good beat, but nothing is more elusive. We may someday look back on The Belle Album as Al Green's best — it's too soon to know; the man has a lifetime ahead of him — and if we do, the beat will be the reason. Whether or not the seemingly effortless religious conviction of the songs Green has written for this record lasts as long as he does, the beat will never wear out.

"All n All" is the number that not even a reprobate could deny; like the Sistine Chapel or Bessie Griffin's "Too Close to Heaven" (on The Gospel Sound, Volume 2, CBS), it carries a sense of liberation and purpose deep enough to make the sinner envy the saved. The beat is very light; in terms of gospel, soul or rock & roll, the beat seems so natural as to be preordained. If it's true, as the Coasters announced in "That Is Rock & Roll," that "in the beginning...there was nothing but rock," then this is what the deity had in mind when the message came rolling down the mountains: "Nothin fancy."

I blaspheme, but "All n All" makes me giddy. Green floats with the music, picking up momentum — but so subtly you don't notice that the song is increasing in force until he breaks the tune open with high, perfectly timed wails so surprising and unfettered he sounds as if he's hitting a note he's been reaching for all his life. I was stunned hearing this: I half-expected Green to start speaking in tongues, but, in a way, he already was.

This is a completely idiosyncratic album — Green produced it, cowrote all the songs and plays precise acoustic and electric guitar — but it's hard for me to understand how anyone could find it inaccessible. Its subject matter — God's grace, and how good it (It?) feels — isn't pushed; there's no ad for Green's ministry on the back cover, and while most of the lyrics are religious, the only song title that even hints at anything beyond the secular realm is "Chariots of Fire." "I Feel Good" endlessly repeats "There's something about King Jesus/That makes me feel fine," but it took many listenings before I realized Green wasn't singing, "There's something about my baby." It's a powerhouse of a recording — the Big Beat, disco-hard rock — and you don't have to listen to the words at all. You do have to listen to the horns, playing charts with as much joy in them as those of "Midnight Hour" had drama.

The lyrics of The Belle Album are nevertheless quite interesting. Green kicks the record off with what I suppose is the key line (from "Belle"): "It's you that I want/But Him that I need." He thus joins a long line of rock & roll want/need oppositionists — from Bob Dylan with "Memphis Blues Again" to the Rolling Stones with "You Can't Always Get What You Want," to name only the best. He leaves them behind in his attempt to resolve the contradiction: Green tries to get Belle to accept Jesus, too. With its half-buried asides about "drunken country bars," the song soon grows very spooky; it has the feel of a long journey to it, akin to Music from Big Pink.

"Georgia Boy," more like The Band, is a seven-minute slow walk through the piney woods, beginning with the ancient, anonymous blues lyric, "Just because I'm from the country," and finally closing with a statement of quiet pride that, perhaps in spite of itself, sounds like a warning: "South's gonna do it again...." The music is far more dreamlike than that of the lovely "Dream"; the textures are very dark on "Georgia Boy," almost in the manner of a Jamaican dub album like Burning Spear's Garvey's Ghost. No less the song of a free man — that is, a man who's won his freedom — than "All n All," "Georgia Boy" simply takes place in a more difficult world, where grace does not seem obvious.

The arrangements are a little looser, the sound a little rougher on The Belle Album than on Green's records of recent years. Still, the drums are as full and bright as ever, the music of a piece with "Funny How Time Slips Away" and "Tired of Being Alone," if not quite with "Look What You Done for Me." Green's music is changing, but simplicity — simplicity of intent, which perhaps here means directness of feeling — is still its foundation.

Not a hint of decadence has crept into Al Green's music since he first came to our attention in 1970. He still sounds as if he's on the verge of great discoveries.

Herewith, two rock & roll singers distinguished by their almost total disregard for the music and marketing strategies of their contemporaries. One is as established as such a performer can be and, it seems, is settling into an acceptance of the refusal of the great audience to accept him; the other is new on the scene and, just possibly, a star for these times. God knows what other times he might be a star for.

Little Criminals offers all the minor charms of Randy Newman's music and none of the major ones: craft without vision, which means the craft is uninspired. The songs aren't even funny; they lack bite. Neither Newman's performances nor his words carry the conviction needed to put across his situational ironies, gnomic narratives and skewed moral tales; in fact, this time around, the ironies, morals and narratives seem too slight to elicit conviction. Newman can't put all of himself into a song as vague as "I'll Be Home" or as pallid as "In Germany before the War," because the songs contain so little of him. One can go back over Newman's work and find any number of tunes that cry out to be heard, whether or not very many people actually did hear them; there isn't a song on Little Criminals that sounds as if it needed to be sung. Newman has always been ambivalent about his ambitions, aesthetic as well as commercial, but this is the first time his ambivalence has gotten the better of him.

What Little Criminals show-cases are not songs, but arrangements, plus the contributions of various members of the Eagles. The arrangements are good — particularly with "Jolly Coppers" and "Baltimore," not to mention the dreamy bandbox sound on "Sigmund Freud's Impersonation of Albert Einstein in America" — but they're good in limbo; the music fails to bring out Newman's lyrics and his singing, because both are so limited. "Baltimore" is clearly meant as a statement about The Death of an American City, but there isn't a detail in it that has anything to do with Baltimore. Where is Newman's eye for the specific, the eye that picked out the little fat man next to Calvin Coolidge in "Louisianna 1927"?

Some of the new songs never rise above the level of the tame joke, but "Sigmund Freud's Impersonation of Albert Einstein in America" aims half-heartedly at serious satire. The song was meant for the soundtrack of Robert Altman's now-shelved movie version of Ragtime; the worst that can be said of it is that it fully matches the cheap sarcasm of E.L. Doctorow's book, and the best that can be said of it is that there is a touching beauty to the way Randy sings the opening lines: "The world of science is my game/And Albert Einstein is my name." The problem is that Newman is no longer taking on the personae of his characters, and so, beyond that first turn of phrase, "Freud" and "Einstein" evaporate. Newman simply has nothing to say — except that America is not all it's cracked up to be, a notion unlikely to stagger even the unwary.

Though Newman has occasionally pandered to his cult of fans — congratulating them for being hipper than the rest of the rock & roll crowd — he has most often dealt with his lack of a broad range of listeners by offering the big, shapeless pop audience work that is better than it demands and tougher than it can handle. He has challenged that audience to respond to his work, and thus challenged himself, as a born minority artist, to reach that audience without conceding anything to that audience's weaknesses. With Little Criminals, one can still say he is making no concessions, but that is because he seems to have none to make.

Elvis Costello's debut album brought home to me just how timid Little Criminals really is. Costello's best songs are anything but timid, but they're as intelligent as some of Newman's finest, as endearingly elusive in their meanings, and funny in the same bitter, self-deprecating manner. They are also, like Newman's signature songs, very weird. Costello, a twenty-two-year-old ex-computer operator who grew up in Liverpool and now looks like an underfed, misanthropic Buddy Holly, is proof that not only are things quite strange in England today, they are capable of getting a lot stranger.

It should be said out front that there is a strictly musical difference, among many others, between Newman and Costello. Newman draws on ragtime, blues, Kurt Weill and movie music to orchestrate his lazy drawl; Costello, who in his quieter moments sounds something like Nick Lowe, who produced My Aim Is True, aims for tricky, infectious pop stylings, or he rocks out. In his less quiet moments he often sings as if there's a gun at his back, and he talks like a true pop obsessive. His songs, he told Nick Kent of New Musical Express, are motivated solely by "revenge and guilt"; he hates the record business so much he has begun to keep a blacklist against the day he seizes power. He wants to die before he gets old: "I'd rather kill myselfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦I'm not going to be around to witness my artistic decline."

There is genius in the wording of that last sentence, and it has found its way into Costello's songs — which tend to the neurotic, though never at the expense of finding the right place for the right lick. His most striking number might be "Less than Zero," which Costello wrote after watching the BBC-TV rehabilitation of Oswald Mosley, in the Thirties the leader of Britain's pro-Hitler Union of Fascists and today a hero of the racist, neo-Fascist National Front.

The message is plain: if there's a place in British society for people like Mosley, then there is no place for Costello — none that he wants, anyway. This song, particularly to American listeners, is obscure, but given the violent behavior of groups like the National Front in Britain today, it is brave, and must be noted. Much more accessible are such edgy rockers as "Welcome to the Working Week" and "I'm Not Angry," or "Alison," a nasty, very sexy ballad. As for "Mystery Dance," imagine an arrangement based somewhere in the vicinity of Little Richard's "Ready Teddy," but supercharged with double-time, explosive dead stops, a band (Clover, a Bay Area group relocated in the U.K.) that plays as if its life depended on it, a mean, desperate vocal, and piano that might as well be swept by Jerry Lee Lewis — all behind these lines, as clean as anything by Chuck Berry, but so much more perverse:

Well I remember when the lights went out 
And I was trying to make it look like it was never in doubt 
She thought that I knew and I thought that she knew 
Both of us were willing 
But we didn't know how to DO IT 
Why don't you tell me 'bout the Mystery DanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.

By the time Costello crashes out of one of the better guitar solos of our day and into the third verse, which is about masturbation — there is a very insistent declension in this song — one realizes that the possibilities of present-day rockabilly have nothing to do with the flaccid revivals of a poser like Robert Gordon. "Mystery Dance," like so much of Costello's album, does not refer back to classic rock: it is classic rock.

My Aim Is True (the title is a line from "Alison") is in the Top Twenty in Britain; it is likely to go higher, as Costello recently managed to get himself busted for taking his electric guitar into the streets. The LP is already getting airplay on American FM stations, and a tour of sorts is set for late fall. How far Costello can go — especially given the unfortunate timing that surrounds his assumed first name — remains to be seen, but I have a feeling that once he is heard, he is going to shake up a lot of his erstwhile peers and make many musicians whom he would not consider his peers seem quite irrelevant — he has the musical sophistication, which is to say access to the musical credibility, to do that, as, at the moment, the Sex Pistols don't.

I think Costello, like Graham Parker and the best of the British punk bands, has only begun to surprise us. Whether or not he is around to witness his artistic decline, I imagine even that would be worth something — as it would be, of course, with Randy Newman, if it is not already.

There is a contradiction here between the enormous abilities of the Wailers — particularly the magnificent rhythm section of Aston Barrett, bass, and Carlton Barrett, drums, and the spidery lead guitar of Julian "Junior" Marvin — and the flatness of the material Bob Marley has given them to work with. The more I listen to this album, the more I am seduced by the playing of the band; at the same time, the connection I want to make with the music is subverted by overly familiar lyric themes unredeemed by wit or color, and by the absence of emotion in Marley's voice. There are some well-crafted lines here, but given Marley's singing, they don't come across. The precise intelligence one hears in every note of music cannot make up for its lack of drama, and that lack is Marley's.

This is very odd. From the time the Wailers' first American album, Catch a Fire, was released here, it was drama that carried the Wailers' music across the water and made it matter to people who had never heard of reggae, and who may well have had to look up Jamaica on a map to figure out exactly where it was. "Concrete Jungle" was as dramatic as Muddy Waters' "Rollin' Stone"; "I Shot the Sheriff" was a one-act play that crossed the boards in under five minutes. On the Wailers' disappointing last album, Rastaman Vibration, there was still "War," where Marley summoned up visions of eternal conflict merely by chanting excerpts from a speech by Haile Selassie. For that matter, Bob Marley onstage defines the kind of drama that grows naturally out of the music of a people who refuse to accept their native land as their true home, whose music, again and again, points them toward the temporally impossible but mystically necessary goal of a return to Africa. As with the overwhelming "Jah Guide" on ex-Wailer Peter Tosh's exciting new album, Equal Rights, Marley onstage is ominous, determined, full of barely suppressed violence. At the same time he offers a suggestion of warmth, of unshakable confidence, of an invitation to the audience to follow him on a heroic quest.

Exodus doesn't reach these heights, nor does it seem to aim for them, save on the seven-minute title performance, which sounds like War on a slow day and wears out long before it is half over. If I didn't have more faith in Marley I'd think he was trying to go disco — the tune is that mechanical. The four songs on the first side that lead up to "Exodus" — songs of religious politics — are all well made, but within the most narrow limits; the best of them is "Natural Mystic," Marley's "Blowin' in the Wind" (though where Dylan seemed to say the answers were blowing away, Marley is certain they are blowing straight to anyone whose soul is pure enough to receive them). On the second side the album falls apart; the mix of sex songs (on "Jamming," Marley sometimes sounds like an obsequious nightclub singer) and tunes about keeping faith simply do not sustain one's interest. Marley's performance never reaches out; it seems to collapse inward. There's no sense of the dangerous, secret messages one half heard on earlier albums; on Exodus there are no secrets to tell.

It is very hard to make any sort of more than superficial judgment on a Wailers album until one knows who it is made for — Jamaicans? American whites? Jamaicans in England? whites in England? Africans? — and I don't know. What bothers me is that I have the feeling Marley, likely pressed by his label to continue the search for an American breakthrough without losing his original base in Jamaica and England, does not know either. The complete lack of extremes on Exodus — of deep emotion, intensely drawn situations or memorable arrangements and melodies — does not mean Marley is playing it safe, but it does seem to imply some sort of paralysis that must be broken before he can again strike with real power.

Of course, there may be another reason for that lack of extremes: last year, Marley and his band were attacked by hitmen just before they were to play at an election rally for Michael Manley, Jamaica's prime minister. Marley and his wife Rita — she is one of the I Threes, whose singing on Exodus is first-rate — were both shot. It is a fact that Marley's music and his religion and his politics, which are hardly separable, could cost him his life. If he has pulled back from that event in his music and in his singing, then it is a withdrawal we are bound to respect; but if it lasts, Marley's would-be assassins will have gotten some of what they came for. Jamaica's most distinctive voice will forfeit its strength. I don't expect that to happen on any permanent basis, but it may be what we are now hearing.

It's been a long haul for both the Band and Van Morrison; they have made their livings as rock & rollers for close to 20 years now. To judge solely by their new albums (Morrison's is his first release since 1974) time is catching up with them, though whether they will again outdistance it remains an open question. Morrison made better music in '64 and '65 with Them, the first (and last?) great Irish rock & roll band; as the Hawks, the Band made better music in '63, covering Bobby Bland and Muddy Waters tunes at the tail end of a Ronnie Hawkins session. Not that rock & roll has ever had anything to do with "progress."

There is a lot of neo-R&B huffing and puffing on A Period of Transition (from what to what?), but Morrison's performances rarely find a focus, almost never hit a groove. The grand gestures of Morrison's style at its most rhetorical ("We are Them, take it or leave it," he snarled during his 1964 sessions) fade in the air. The emotion that would justify those gestures, that would put a little terror into borrowed lines like "From a whisper to a scream," is just out of reach: Transition is "Jackie Wilson Said" without the bite.

The key to the album's sluggishness is the dullness of the horn charts. Van is the most inventive and lyrical arranger of horns rock & roll has known since the heyday of Stax-Volt, but "Flamingos Fly" is the only tune to which the horns add anything but sound; there, they add wit and a sense of fun. This is "Jackie Wilson Said" and something more; the album's finest number by a long distance. The groove is irresistible, and it capsizes the rest of the album.

Van Morrison once sang "Listen to the Lion" and made you feel as if you'd been cornered by one; he will do it again, but he doesn't do it on Transition. This is by no means a bad album, but it lives up to its title all too well.

"I'm not really here, I just stick around for my friends," Captain Beefheart used to say, and that sums up what I hear on Islands — which is not nothing. To be sure, there's not a grand gesture on it. I can't imagine this album meaning anything to someone who does not feel that his or her successes and failures are somehow reflected in the Band's. If one does feel that, Islands is anything but hollow — it may sound like an unassuming last word, if hardly a last stand.

Since the members of the Band have not moved to Hawaii, it's the album's title, and the specter of the Band's recent farewell concert, that implies that last word. Rick Danko and Levon Helm have signed solo recording contracts, and Helm is already working with Dr. John and Paul Butterfield; the thinness of the material on Islands suggests they may be keeping their best songs for their own albums, and the inclusion of a couple of oldies doesn't make up the difference. "Ain't That a Lotta Love," a barband staple that a couple of years ago on a San Francisco stage Levon, Garth Hudson, Danko, Neil Young, Tim Drummond and Ben Keith stomped out as if they meant to stop the sun in its tracks, is on Islands the stiffest excuse for R&B I ever want to hear; too many of Robbie Robertson's tunes offer cracker-barrel banalities without the music that could redeem them — or disguise them. "You don't know what you want 'til you find out what you need" might be true and it might not be, but the point is it isn't interesting.

Save for a couple of Richard Manuel's vocals, I was ready to give up on this record. Then I began to hear it on the radio, and it sounded fresh. Now, while the first side of the LP passes pleasantly and tiresomely enough, side two seems like real people talking: that last word. "Islands," the title instrumental, is slight and pretty — it disarms one's desire for grand gestures, and it sets a tone. The tone is one of moderation; that is almost what the best songs here are about, in their music, in the feeling they get across. Manuel's version of "Georgia on My Mind" recalls the heart he put into "Whispering Pines," almost eight years ago. "Knockin' Lost John," a fine, unprofound ditty about the Great Depression of the Thirties, simply speaks to the present, and again, Manuel, without ever reaching for a note, gives the piece its authenticity; his voice carries the authority of an old man who can put up with anything but who'd just as soon not. "I went through it once," he seems to be saying. "I'm damned if I'll go through it again."

And then there is "Livin' in a Dream," which closes out the set: a rewrite of "Row Row Row Your Boat." Well, it is the best song on Islands — a perfect cut. I hear it as a leave-taking, but then I have finales on my mind. The beat could not be less hurried, nor could the lines Levon sings, nor the way he sings them:

I'm gonna buy buy buy you
A sheepskin coat
I'm gonna string red rubies round your throat
Gently down the stream I will row your boat
'Cause you know we're only livin' in a dream.

There's no languor in the song, only pleasure; there are no promises that can't be kept, and the promises Levon makes seem to have been kept when the tune ends. That spirit doesn't sell records, but it may keep them in mind, when the time is right.

Still, in rock & roll a little modesty goes a long way. These are not the worst albums Van Morrison and the Band have made, but except for Morrison's "Flamingos Fly" and the Band's "Livin' in a Dream" they make the best almost inexplicable. One cannot think of the power of "Chest Fever" and easily understand the triviality of "Ain't That a Lotta Love"; one can't quite pin down the fatal difference between the urgency of "St. Dominic's Preview" or "You Don't Pull No Punches but You Don't Push the River" and the unconvincing strain of most of Transition. What you do, if you are committed to these artists, is wait.

hanks to the near-permanent success of the current Fleetwood Mac LP, virtually all the band's pre-Warner Bros. material – featuring guitarists Peter Green, Danny Kirwan and Jeremy Spencer – is back on the market. The best stuff is to be found on Fleetwood Mac in Chicago (Sire), a double album cut in '69 at the Chess studios, with real-life black bluesmen sitting in. A year ago, when this album was out of print, it was selling for 20 bucks, and it's worth it. The Fleetwood Mac that cut this album was a rough, derivative band, full of enthusiasm and committed to their music (they showed their scholarship with their first single, "Rambling Pony," a slight rewrite of an unearthly version of "Rollin' and Tumblin'," cut in 1951 by Muddy Waters, Little Walter and Leroy Foster; they also showed their limitations, because they couldn't handle it). The shade of Elmore James smiled on the band, and never more so than on Chicago, when Jeremy Spencer cut loose with four straight live-in-the-studio tributes; as a singer and as a guitarist, he met his master on almost equal terms. "Madison Blues" – despite the fact that Mick Fleetwood can't find a beat – is a celebration of everything in the blues that winks at pain, with fine, loping tenor sax from Chicagoan J.T. Brown and beautifully free guitar work by Spencer; "I'm Worried" and "I Can't Hold Out" both feature the classic Robert Johnson riff out of which, as Peter Guralnick has written, Elmore James made a career – he and Spencer, that is. These cuts soar; they are glorious. The guitar rings, flies out of the band, with Willie Dixon high-lighting the best moments with the subtlest, most precise little touches on his string bass, and though there may be more to rock & roll than this, listening, one feels there doesn't have to be. As for the singing – well, no white man ever threw away the last word of a blues lyric with more flair, or more humor, than Jeremy Spencer, who has since thrown it all away for God. Most of Chicago is appealing, but "I'm Worried" and "I Can't Hold Out" are small works of art.

"Love That Burns" is also a work of art, but not a small one. A case can be made that it is the finest white recording of the blues ever made – certainly of slow blues, though Duane Allman's opening solo on Boz Scaggs's "Loan Me a Dime" may match it. Perhaps one should say of pure blues: there is not an element in the music in debt to any other form. "Love That Burns" is an exquisite piece from the first note to the last: quiet, sagging horns; the echoed, ghostly taps of Mick Fleetwood's plain-speech drumming; and most of all, the singing and guitar playing of Peter Green, who cowrote the tune. Unlike all but a handful of his white contemporaries, Green understood that the secret of the blues is in restraint – in the choice not only of notes but of the silences between the notes – and none of his contemporaries equaled the understanding he displayed here. His beautiful crying vocal sounds not black but what it sounds like; his guitar playing bends your emotions, lets them go, lets them rest, takes them back, demanding all the empathy you have to give, until, for a time, any other recording sounds & little overwrought, inarticulate, unsure. From the 1969 LP English Rose, "Love That Burns" can be heard on either Vintage Years (Sire) or Black Magic Woman (Epic), both two-record sets that overlap somewhat; Vintage Years is probably better, if only for a version of "Need Your Love So Bad."

The early Fleetwood Mac had its own sound. Christine McVie has had hers since she released "Spare Me a Little of Your Love" on FM's 1972 Bare Trees LP, but on the evidence of The Legendary Christine Perfect Album (Sire), cut when she was between Chicken Shack and FM, she didn't in 1969. I've found McVie irresistible over the years, probably because in looks and voice she's the closest thing in rock & roll to Blythe Danner, but none of the talent for melody, arranging of vocals and instrumental textures, or pure heart-on-her-sleeve brassiness that has given her recent work its strength is present on Perfect. There are good tunes – "Wait and See," which reminds me of Donovan's "Bert's Blues" in feeling, and a remake of Etta James's "I'd Rather Go Blind" – but fans McVie won with "Over My Head" or "Say You Love Me" would do better to dig up the likes of Penguin and Heroes Are Hard to Find. Ever hear "Remember Me"?

Ever hear "Remember Me"?

As a determinedly permanent resident of the West Coast, the furor Bruce Springsteen's live performances have kicked up in the East over the last couple of years left me feeling somewhat culturally deprived, not to mention a little suspicious. The legendary three-hour sets Springsteen and his E Street Band apparently rip out night after night in New York, Province-town, Boston and even Austin have generated a great tumult and shouting; but, short of flying 3000 miles to catch a show, there was no way for an outlander to discover what the fuss was all about.

Certainly, I couldn't find the reasons on Springsteen's first two albums, despite Columbia's "New Dylan" promotional campaign for the debut disc and the equally thoughtful "Street Poet" cover of the second. Both radiated self-consciousness, whereas the ballyhoo led one to hope for the grand egotism of historic rock & roll stars; both seemed at once flat and more than a little hysterical, full of sound and fury, and signifying, if not nothing, not much.

A bit guiltily, I found anything by Roxy Music far more satisfying. They could at least hit what they aimed for; while it was clear Springsteen was after bigger game, the records made me wonder if he knew what it was. Whether he did or not, with two "you gotta see him live" albums behind him, the question of whether Springsteen would ever make his mark on rock & roll — or hang onto the chance to do so — rested on that third LP, which was somehow "long awaited" before the ink was dry on the second. Very soon, he would have to come across, put up or shut up. It is the rock & roller's great shoot-out with himself: The kid with promise hits the dirt and the hero turns slowly, blows the smoke from his pistol, and goes on his way.

Or else, the kid and the hero go down together, twitching in the dust while the onlookers turn their heads and talk safely of what might have been. The end. Fade-out.

Springsteen's answer is Born to Run. It is a magnificent album that pays off on every bet ever placed on him — a '57 Chevy running on melted down Crystals records that shuts down every claim that has been made. And it should crack his future wide open.

The song titles by themselves — "Thunder Road," "Night," "Backstreets," "Born to Run," "Jungleland" — suggest the extraordinary dramatic authority that is at the heart of Springsteen's new music. It is the drama that counts; the stories Springsteen is telling are nothing new, though no one has ever told them better or made them matter more. Their familiar romance is half their power: The promise and the threat of the night; the lure of the road; the quest for a chance worth taking and the lust to pay its price; girls glimpsed once at 80 miles an hour and never forgotten; the city streets as the last, permanent American frontier. We know the story: one thousand and one American nights, one long night of fear and love.

What is new is the majesty Springsteen and his band have brought to this story. Springsteen's singing, his words and the band's music have turned the dreams and failures two generations have dropped along the road into an epic — an epic that began when that car went over the cliff in Rebel Without a Cause. One feels that all it ever meant, all it ever had to say, is on this album, brought forth with a determination one would have thought was burnt out years ago. One feels that the music Springsteen has made from this long story has outstripped the story; that it is, in all its fire, a demand for something new.

In one sense, all this talk of epic comes down to sound. Rolling Stone contributing editor Jon Landau, Mike Appel and Springsteen produced Born to Run in a style as close to mono as anyone can get these days; the result is a sound full of grandeur. For all it owes to Phil Spector, it can be compared only to the music of Bob Dylan & the Hawks made onstage in 1965 and '66. With that sound, Springsteen has achieved something very special. He has touched his world with glory, without glorifying anything: not the romance of escape, not the unbearable pathos of the street fight in "Jungleland," not the scared young lovers of "Backstreets" and not himself.

"Born to Run" is the motto that speaks for the album's tales, just as the guitar figure that runs through the title song — the finest compression of the rock & roll thrill since the opening riffs of "Layla" — speaks for its music. But "Born to Run" is uncomfortably close to another talisman of the lost kids that careen across this record, a slogan Springsteen's motto inevitably suggests. It is an old tattoo: "Born to Lose." Springsteen's songs — filled with recurring images of people stranded, huddled, scared, crying, dying — take place in the space between "Born to Run" and "Born to Lose," as if to say, the only run worth making is the one that forces you to risk losing everything you have. Only by taking that risk can you hold on to the faith that you have something left to lose. Springsteen's heroes and heroines face terror and survive it, face delight and die by its hand, and then watch as the process is reversed, understanding finally that they are paying the price of romanticizing their own fear.

One soft infested summer/Me and Terry became friends/Trying in vain to breathe/The fire we was born in.../Remember all the movies, Terry/We'd go see/Trying to learn to walk like the heroes/We thought we had to be/Well after all this time/To find we're just like all the rest/Stranded in the park/And forced to confess/To/Hiding on the backstreets/Hiding on the backstreets/Where we swore forever friends....

Those are a few lines from "Backstreets," a song that begins with music so stately, so heartbreaking, that it might be the prelude to a rock & roll version of The Iliad. Once the piano and organ have established the theme the entire band comes and plays the theme again. There is an overwhelming sense of recognition: No, you've never heard anything like this before, but you understand it instantly, because this music — or Springsteen crying, singing wordlessly, moaning over the last guitar lines of "Born to Run," or the astonishing chords that follow each verse of "Jungleland," or the opening of "Thunder Road" — is what rock & roll is supposed to sound like.

The songs, the best of them, are adventures in the dark, incidents of wasted fury. Tales of kids born to run who lose anyway, the songs can, as with "Backstreets," hit so hard and fast that it is almost impossible to sit through them without weeping. And yet the music is exhilarating. You may find yourself shaking your head in wonder, smiling through tears at the beauty of it all. I'm not talking about lyrics; they're buried, as they should be, hard to hear for the first dozen playings or so, coming out in bits and pieces. To hear Springsteen sing the line "Hiding on the backstreets" is to be captured by an image; the details can come later. Who needed to figure out all the words to "Like a Rolling Stone" to understand it?

It is a measure of Springsteen's ability to make his music bleed that "Backstreets," which is about friendship and betrayal between a boy and a girl, is far more deathly than "Jungleland," which is about a gang war. The music isn't "better," nor is the singing — but it is more passionate, more deathly and, necessarily, more alive. That, if anything, might be the key to this music: As a ride through terror, it resolves itself finally as a ride into delight.

"Oh-o, come on, take my hand," Springsteen sings, "Riding out to case the promised land." And there, in a line, is Born to Run. You take what you find, but you never give up your demand for something better because you know, in your heart, that you deserve it. That contradiction is what keeps Springsteen's story, and the promised land's, alive. Springsteen took what he found and made something better himself. This album is it.

For America the Who's live album comes out at just that time when, commercially, it is most appropriate; that is, after the band has finally escaped from its status as a critic's darling to satisfy the half-formed intellectual yearnings of an American record-buying public. We shouldn't fool ourselves: a good part of the appeal of Tommy was its claim to profundity, a claim that was hardly lost on the hundreds of thousands who bought it (and who bought Led Zeppelin to satisfy other sorts of needs), and a claim which had no need of legitimizing verbiage from attendant writers to help it along. Writers felt compelled to write about Tommy – but for some reason it wasn't at all fun to read about, most likely because the ideas were clear enough. Tommy was an album of ideas first and foremost; on record, it didn't have much value as rock and roll.

So the Who made it, commercially. It was time to document themselves on record, and of course the only way to do that was to release a live album (because the Who, up until now, have equaled The Who On Stage). The problem was that they'd been trying to do that for at least two years without coming up with anything that sounded good enough to spring on the public – and before Tommy, they were at that point where a bad album with a lot of hype could have killed their commercial potential.

After Tommy it wasn't so risky and it was time for it. They did a gig at a college in England, recorded it, dug it, and came up with The Who Live At Leeds. Peter Townshend, who is the best critic of rock and roll in the world (his two interviews in Rolling Stone, at any rate, are the most brilliant and provocative dissertations on what rock and roll is, how it works, and what it's for that I've ever read), packaged the record in such a way as to heighten its function as a document (included are a lyric sheet for "My Generation" in Townshend's own hand, rejection slips from record companies and cancellations of gigs, old pay sheets, a great poster from the Marquee Club in London, circa about 1964, a receipt for smoke-bombs, a line-up for a strings-and-flute band called Brian Carroll and the Playboys affixed to a few lines from Tommy . . . wonderful stuff). Townshend also arranged the cover in such a way as to satirize, take advantage of the commercial potential of, and avoid – bootlegging. It's a tour-de-force of the rock and roll imagination.

The music itself is not nearly so fine. It has aged, and while the time for the album is right, the time for the music has passed, for the band, and perhaps for us as well. The Who on stage, in the first place, were the product of Townshend's mind, his emotions, and his desires; and now those desires have been mostly fulfilled, at least within the context originally set up for their expression. Thus, on several cuts, we find the Who curiously disguised as Led Zeppelin (and not just Daltrey either). It might make a good joke in the telling but it sure pales in the listening. "My Generation," once a cataclysm (the real "Young Man's Blues," a song that in its prime made the number that begins the LP irrelevant), was recorded too late. It's no longer necessary or, perhaps, save at rare moments, not captured here, possible for the Who to speak this piece; but what genius it was for Townshend to make the primal teenager sing with a stutter!

The fact that put-downs-because-they-get-around have changed to praise in the New York Times can't help but turn the music in odd directions. "My Generation" is listed here with a running time of 14:27, but with this take it's a few minutes of the old anthem and nearly a dozen of a medley from Tommy and other bits of sound. In the abstract, it all sounds good to me, but for all who found their way into its frenzy, "My Generation" was an event, on record and on stage. The first time I saw it happen I was honestly scared. It's tame here. There is a lot of good music around these days – but very few events. We used to mark time by records – "a few months after Rubber Soul" – but the music is a little weaker and the rest of the world is a great deal stronger. It's a couple of months since Kent, now.

The two cuts that break off the album like the Who-classics they are may well be the songs the band has played for the longest time every gig for years: "The Summertime Blues" and "Shaking All Over." Perhaps because Townshend didn't write them they have changed – in spirit – the least. These songs still play the same role with the audience that they always did, which isn't true for "My Generation," These songs, simple, perfect, and in the case of "Summertime Blues," universal, still uphold the same values when they go down between the Who and a crowd and those values are still valid. The absurd doesn't go out of date. Townshend found Eddie Cochran's song, or it was given to him on some half-forgotten tour ten years ago – it might be the reason the whole Who extravaganza got off the ground in the first place – and it's the grammar-book of his rock and roll language. The Who found a way to play it on their terms, let it form their identity, and since they didn't create it there was never any need to reject it. Their performance here is glorious.

The rest of the album is good music.

The Who Live was not simply music, or "show," but something a great deal more than the sum of its obvious parts. You understood it viscerally and carried that understanding around like a catch-phrase of the shared private mind of a generation. That isn't here on this record, because it does seem as if the Who recorded a memory of the past and ended up with what was left over in the present.

The album is a document, as it ought to be: the formal commercial end of the first great stage of their great career. With all the ordinary milestones behind them, thanks to their vision and their sound, we and they arrive, with a Led Zeppelin joke on one side and the crunch of the Who on the other, at that point where Peter Townshend and his band will begin to translate the Seventies into rock and roll. It's a language that seems to speak most clearly when it stutters, after all.

Wop-bop-a-lu-bop-a-lop-bam-boom. Thud. "Tutti Frutti," which opens the partly excellent MC5 album, is easily the worst cut on it, and in a way a clue to the rest of the record, which ends, stiffly enough, with "Back in the USA." The MC5 have roots; or their producer Jon Landau does, or somebody does. Over four minutes of totally pointless music is expended in "proving" that fact — and regardless of the possible coy significance of this one-time "Killer Band" singing "Back in the USA" as if it was some kind of confession, the performances of the old rock are dead, like someone reciting the alphabet instead of using the letters to make words.

There are some first-rate songs on the album, some good musical ideas, and the musicianship is competent throughout, often fun, sometimes exciting. "Musicianship," here, is used as a concept — the idea of a "solid, clean, tight and together" sound is as self-conscious as the total freak out the first LP was. Chuck Berry simply oozes from the album.

A group of teenage consciousness numbers fill out the album — a re-working of themes from the Beach Boys, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent, old South Philly street music, and the like. There's "Shakin' Street" — the title predicts both the words and music; "Call Me Animal"; "High School" — sis boom bah, rah rah rah, and so on. And then there are the cuts that make it, make it all the way, that show the real talent and special gifts of this band.

"Teenage Lust" is just what is sounds like — urges all over the place, good hard rock (lacking any bass sound, as does the LP throughout, which is a drag), and those lines that Rob Tyner sings with such showmanship: "I need a healthy outlet for/ For my teenage lust." If you don't think that's funny, you didn't go to high school in the USA. Coming off the humor and the drive of the music, the song cuts deep, like "I Get Around." "The American Ruse" is probably the best thing the band has recorded; an attempt at phrase-making that just might come off:


I used to say the pledge of allegiance
Until they beat me bloody down at the station
They haven't got a word outa me
Since I got a billion years probation
boom
'69 American terminal stasis
The air's so thick it's like breathin' in molasses
I'm sick and tired of payin' these dues
And I'm sick to my guts of the American RUSE!

That, in a few lines, is classic rock and roll songwriting. It's rarely done better. The chord changes that power the song seem to match up with the hurried tempo — the band can't wait to get to that last line, and the impact of every moment is heightened by the rush. Virtually the whole album is fast and edgy — but the problem of the music is in its competence. And the problem of its competence is in its so-carefully worked out intentions. Nothing was left to chance.

Nothing was left to chance, it seems, because this album, and the songs on it, constitute a very conscious attempt to do for teenage America what the rock and roll of the Fifties did instinctively and naturally — create a young community of spirit, affection, excitement, and self-consciousness. It's an attempt to define themes and problems and an offering of political, social, and emotional solutions. The clean, direct approach of the sound is the necessary vehicle for the straightforward consciousness of the message: "Look, kid, you're not just some alienated sap bugged by the system, you're part of a gang that doesn't have rules yet, doesn't have leaders yet, but it's forming, kid, get on." That's what Peter Townshend did with "My Generation," what Eddie Cochran did with "Come On Everybody."

But the music, the sound, and in the end the care with which these themes have been shaped drags it down, save for two or three fine numbers that deserve to be played on every jukebox in the land. The street music of the MC5 has none of the animalism of the Good Rats (you might still find their brilliant LP — Kapp KS 3580) or uncontrollable drive of those first crucial sides by the Who. You can decide what to do, but if you feel like you know it all, like you've seen it all, when it comes time to make the music, there's really nothing there but an idea.

Phil Spector once talked about the difference between "records" and "ideas" — "The man who can make a disc that's a record and an idea will rule the world," he said in his typically moderate fashion. The MC5 album, for the most part, remains an idea, because in the end it sounds like a set-up. "Teenage Lust" and "American Ruse" and "Human Being Lawnmower" break through, and they belong on singles, and on the charts. All the way up the charts.

Rod Stewart, lead singer with the off-again on-again Jeff Beck group, has come up with a superb album of his own. Imagination pervades the music, in the choice of material, in the frequent use of beautiful bottleneck guitar work to draw out the subtler aspects of many cuts (Ron Wood is responsible here), and in the range Stewart himself displays on virtually every vocal.

British albums are often over-done, with good ideas transformed into gimmicks; on this record the music sustains itself through innumerable listenings. A bass solo is not an indulgence here but a perfect lead-in to striking piano; the bottleneck is so sparing that you simply hunger for more of that brilliant sound. What is more amazing is that the musicians make their statements with the same sort of friendly sympathy that recently has been displayed only by the Stones and by the three geniuses of Traffic. Their soul is in their timing.

Stewart opens by taking the big risk, with "Street Fighting Man." And, like Johnny Winter's "Highway 61 Revisited," Rod's performance shows no self-consciousness, no worry about the "right way" to do it. He starts in the middle, brakes with a crash, and then a familiar "We Love You" riff on the piano carries the song back to the Stones' beginning. Rod's ending. It's just a fine piece of music, not a cover.

"Man of Constant Sorrow" is next; Stewart's own guitar is up front, while Wood's bottleneck creeps in from the other channel, adding depth to a vocal that is just about the definition of English soul. The richness of this album begins to suggest itself here — this is not just another solid Joe Cocker LP, but something more. You don't hear Ray Charles or anyone else looking over Stewart's shoulder, but an echo of lessons well earned.

"Handbags & Gladrags" clinches it. It will remind most of the Stones' "No Expectations"; the same soft despairing heart-breaking Floyd Cramer-style piano played by Mike D'Abo, and again, the sort of restraint and timing that makes the listener wish the song would never end. It's a very sophisticated composition, a brief story that's full of emotion but which never slides into dull sentiment. Like the rest of the songs Stewart is singing here, it's not going to get old.

Stewart's LP is perhaps the only album released this year that reflects something of the feeling of Beggars' Banquet, aside from Let It Bleed. And, unlike so many of the records of 1969, issued with a flood of hype and forgotten after a dozen playings, this one is for keeps. Many LPs are a lot flashier than this one, but damn few are any better.

OAKLAND, California—We flooded into the Oakland Coliseum in 1969 with memories of the Cow Palace in 1966 – but this time there weren't any twelve-year-old kids kicking over the seats and wetting their pants. The Sixties are over – the first thing that hit you when the Stones came out on stage was the evidence of the years in Mick Jagger's face. It seemed to have fallen into place for good. His features were no longer supple and loose; they were hard and thick, like the marble ridges of a statue. But that's a long way from the House of Wax. He still looked beautiful.

Jagger was dressed right out of Sympathy for the Devil, but for me the costume didn't take hold until near the end of the show, when it no longer seemed like a costume. Black tight pants with silver studs up the side; a black blouse with a beige horseshoe on it, special astrology for the warlock's tour; an Uncle Sam hat out of Ginsberg; and a red scarf that might have been ten feet long. Keith Richards, Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, even Mick Taylor, they all looked like Rolling Stones; but they weren't stepping out. They put the weight on Mick, and he was carrying it. The band was nervous, and it wasn't all that clear whether or not they were going to make it this time.

Listen to the audience on the live cuts from Out of Our Heads or December's Children or to Got Live If You Want It! There must have been a time when the Stones played to crowds that didn't rise up screaming the moment they hit the stage, kids possessed with that Stones' demon that made them charge the bandstand with every new song, keeping up the clamor until the Stones had played their last encore and left for good—but if there was such a time it's been a long, long while. Those times are here again, and both the Rolling Stones and the audience had to take this night and make a great show out of it regardless.

The screams don't come so easy any more. The flashing excitement of simply looking at the Stones is displaced. Dylan doesn't tour, the Beatles don't tour, and it's been three years since any of us have seen Mick Jagger. So we had to look at him to make sure he was really there. The giant TV screen up above the stage held images that in an odd way were more real than the show itself— somehow it made more sense to see a picture of Mick Jagger than to see Mick Jagger himself. We were all quite out of time.

"So happy to be here, and all that bullshit," said Mick, after the opening shot, a metal-hard "Jumping Jack Flash." He was clearly pissed that the crowd had clapped with merely uncertain enthusiasm for both his entry and for his first vocal. He'd danced stiffly on that first number, feeling out the stage, but the audience had been feeling out Mick. It was as if there were complaints that this band had been, you know, "over-hyped."

Things had not gone smoothly during the first set, some hours before. Richards' amp had blown, and he'd tossed his see-through plexiglass guitar into the air and walked off stage. The Stones had been forty-five minutes late – not, as Jagger told the audience, because no one came to pick them up at the airport, but because Tina Turner had put on such a dynamite show the band hadn't wanted to follow her too quickly. Then in the middle of "Satisfaction" Bill Graham and the tour manager got into a pushing and shoving match right on stage. A hassle all around. That was what some people talked about when they left the first show – that and the bad sound.

It was 2:30, the Stones had been on for ten minutes, and while Jagger pranced with growing enthusiasm and Richards stung the hardest notes from his guitar, the sound system booming in perfect balance, the audience was still warming up. "Oh, Carol" – "Oh, groovy, Chuck Berry, hmmmmmmmmm . . ." "Sympathy for the Devil" somehow slipped past. We were, I think, judging the music, not responding to it, and this too must have been new to the Stones. Years ago we'd just groove with the loud hum of the band and the ranging dark cheer of the crowd into one giant instrument: THE STONES! And us. Now we heard the guitar solos.

Mick sneered at the audience. "Since you're all so quiet tonight . . . Since you're all sitting down, well then, we'll sit down too." He and Keith Richard squatted down for two slow southern blues: "Prodigal Son" from the last album and a new one, "Gotta Move." They were a lot of fun. Keith played a very classy old steel guitar, and Mick found the night's best moment up till then when he let out with a soft, low Robert Johnson moan – very moving, very intense – while he mugged at the audience and rolled his big eyeballs.

The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: The Rolling Stones, Beggar's Banquet

There was a queer distance between Mick and the Stones – this devastating band and their devouring leader – and the audience. It'd be easiest to think the reason was the massive Oakland Coliseum, but it was more than that. We've grown up with the Stones, and we are more likely closer to where they are than we were four or five years ago – we have influenced them too – but somehow this closeness of spirit increased the distance between the Stones as performers and ourselves as the audience. Or perhaps it was another incident that brought the new feel of the concert home. I walked upstairs to the men's room between acts, and sitting on the can I noticed two cats blowing each other in the next stall. Somehow I can't imagine that having happened at the Cow Palace in 1966. The transfiguration of wet pants has come – She blew my nose, and then she blew my mind . . . closer and farther away. Mick kept trying to catch it.

They did "Love In Vain," one of the most beautiful of all the songs by the great Robert Johnson. It was a triumph. Mick Taylor handled the break with a finesse of his emotion, and Jagger used the spaces of the tragic blues to summon up all of his power: "The blue light . . . was mah bay-bee . . . and the red light . . . was my mind . . . "

And it's hard to tell and
It's hard to tell and
It's hard to tell . . . 
All my love's in vain . . . 

The music got better and better and the applause was just applause. Into and out of "I'm Free," a rollicking "Under My Thumb" with Mick breaking loose on stage and still looking for his audience. Kids were moving down the aisles, sort of wandering along, as if they hoped no one would notice. They were eagerly and persistently hustled back by the floor crew. The guard near me was an old black man with a tam-o'-shanter. Would have been a respectable job for Hayakawa.

"Slowly rocking on," as Mick put it, frowning, they went into their new numbers. "Midnight Rambler" was the first. It'll rank with "Sympathy for the Devil," "Salt of the Earth" and "Goin' Home" as a Stones classic. What an amazing song! On and on it went, Mick now looking the part his clothes had created, falling to his knees, the notes from the two guitars surround him and finally us – a dark, evil song, dripping with the spirit of the Rolling Stones. There was movement in the band, and the audience was on the edge of real excitement. Jesus! On the edge! It was that hard, even in the midst of such brilliance. "Live With Me" was next, beginning with the line, "I got nasty habits, baby . . . " Chuck Berry riffs flew in and out of the choruses, Mick spinning, clapping his hands, one-two-three-four over his shoulder, dipping his scarf low, forcing a memory of how fabulous he'd been in "Sympathy for the Devil" forty minutes before. "Yesss, pleased to meet you, baby" – whooshing into a mannered bow – "Hope you . . . guess my name . . . " And the concert was finally catching up with us. Then a dramatic, shouting "Gimme Shelter," Mick dancing faster, Keith Richard beginning to move out, and the place was getting itchy. A girl was bopping in her seat and the guard told her to stop. She didn't.

The Rolling Stones, 1963-1969: Behind the Scenes Snapshots

"I can't see anyone," yelled Mick. "We wanna see who we came to play for. Turn on the lights!" All the light went up and the aisles began to fill with real urgency. Mick played to the crowd, pushing them on. If he couldn't make them rush the stage, pushing to get to him, waving their arms and forcing everyone else to stand on their seats and wave their arms, then he'd have had it as MICK JAGGER OF THE ROLLING STONES. He'd be Mick Jagger, Movie Star, or Mick Jagger the Recording Artist, but that was not what it was about and that was not what mattered. And now, with the lights on, perhaps it was embarrassing to be calm and restrained, or perhaps the Stones were more real, out of the spotlight and just part of the celebration. But Mick had brought it off; he'd really had to do it himself.

"He could play a guitar just like ringing a bell," and Keith Richards can do that, but by this time he was playing as if a bomb had just gone off in Chuck Berry's bell-tower. Huge notes and titanic bursts of sound commanded the crowd up to the stage and pushed more people up against the vanguard as the Rolling Stones powered in to "Satisfaction." It was like a blur. Devils dancing on stage. No more feeling it out. The stage was showered with joints. The Stones flashed grins at each other and now that the big TV screen had faded the music seemed louder and you realized that some of the audience was really that close to grabbing Mick's scarf.

This wasn't any ritual that the Stones and the audience were acting out in respect for something that had happened years before. Mick and the band had reached for it and won. It was real . . . Bump-Bump-Da-Dump-Da-Dump-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis . . . The blur moved faster, Mick mincing beautifully, finally shooting his arm out in one motion and twirling it above his head in another: I met her on the boulevards of Paris . . . Keith bent down almost to his knees, shaking notes out while Mick Taylor carried the solo, Mick flying from one side of the stage to the other, whirling to a dead stop, grabbing the mike and blurting out more lines: The lady, she covered me with roses. . . .

They ended it past three-thirty in the morning with "Street Fighting Man." Jagger seemed to draw himself up over his own height as he gestured for the words – the hall was fully lit, as if we were stealing a thrill from someone's closed-door idea of what the concert was supposed to be. It got away. Mick waved his arms until the crowd waved back and then stepped to the edge of the stage and blew astonishing kisses – with both hands – to everyone. Mick Jagger singing with his rock and roll band – a glorious moment.

I knew it had really happened that way when I got home around five A.M. Pinned to the icebox was a note: "Just came by after the concert. Wasn't it great!!! We got within five feet of Mick!" And not without his help. In a way, that was the best part.

A few months ago I walked into the Rolling Stone office and palely inquired if the journal might possibly be interested in a review of the then-new Dusty Springfield album. Blank stares and a few snickers. Today, Jackie De Shannon's "Put a Little Love in Your Heart" is one of the day's events on AM radio and I still dig Dusty in Memphis.

Dusty started out with a nice little rocker called "I Only Want to Dance With You," her first hit, riding in on the heels of Beatle boots in 1964, and then scored with, some of us anyway, a monster, "Wishin' and Hopin.'" As opposed to Leslie Gore's great single, "You Don't Own Me," Dusty's song was the ultimate anti-Women's Liberation ballad: "Wear your hair, just for him ..." We used to turn it up loud on double-dates. Dusty had this way with words, a soft, sensual box (voice) that allowed her to combine syllables until they turned into pure cream. "AnIvrything'inboutH'greeeaaate true love is ..." And then a couple of years later she hit the top with "The Look of Love" and seemed destined to join that crowd of big-bosomed, low-necked lady singers that play what Lenny Bruce called "the class rooms" and always encore with "Born Free."

It didn't happen, and Dusty in Memphis is the reason why. This album was constructed with the help of some of the best musicians in Memphis and with the use of superb material written by, among others, Jerry Goffin & Carol King, Randy Newman, and Barry Mann & Cynthia Weil. Now Dusty is not a soul singer, and she makes no effort to "sound black" — rather she is singing songs that ordinarily would have been offered by their writers to black vocalists. Most of the songs, then, have a great deal of depth while presenting extremely direct and simple statements about love. Unlike Aretha, who takes possession of whatever she does, Dusty sings around her material, creating music that's evocative rather than overwhelming. Listening to this album will not change your life, but it'll add to it.

There are three hits on this LP, and they are representative of the rest of it. "Son of a Preacher Man" is as down-home as Dusty gets; it has an intro that's funky, a vocal that's almost dirty. The bass gives the song presence and Dusty doesn't have to strain to carry it off. No one has topped her version of this yet and no one's likely to. "Don't Forget About Me" is to my ears the best cut here — it opens with a counterpoint between bass and vibrating guitar that's tremendously exciting, and then Dusty enters, her voice almost like another instrument. The song picks up Gene Chrisman's woodblock and the Sweet Inspirations and it's a fast race home. Piano cues Reggie Young's sizzling guitar (and it's a crime that Atlantic mixed Young down from the version used on the single) toward the end, and it's his show from then on. Better musicianship is not to be found, and I include Dusty as one of those musicians.

Finally, there's "The Windmills of Your Mind," a slick song that served as the soundtrack for the slickest movie of recent years, The Thomas Crown Affair. The rest of the album falls somewhere in between this cut and the other hits, but not to be missed are superb versions of "No Easy Way Down," "So Much Love," and "Just a Little Lovin.'"

Most white female singers in today's music are still searching for music they can call their own. Dusty is not searching — she just shows up, and she, and we, are better for it.

As a comeback album, Marvin Gaye's Midnight Love is remarkably arrogant: it simply picks up from 1973's Let's Get It On as if only ten minutes, and not a confusing ten years, had elapsed since Gaye hit his commercial peak. But make no mistake: this record, which has become the biggest crossover hit of the singer's career, is a comeback for Gaye, whose last couple of albums, despite their funkster defenders, committed the unpardonable sin of tedium.

 

Midnight Love is anything but boring. It has the rhythmic tension, melodic delicacy and erotic resilience of Gaye's greatest music, and it extends those attributes by applying contemporary synthesizer gimmickry judiciously and soulfully. Gaye plays about eighty percent of the instruments here himself, and his synthesizer work, as well as his drumming, is a revelation. And everything here, including the ribald greeting-card verse of the lyrics, underscores the relentless erotic obsession that's at the core of Gaye's concerns.

But Midnight Love isn't as truly ambitious a record as Gaye's greatest album, What's Going On (1971), was. In the disintegration of his marriage and his eventual divorce, Gaye seems also to have experienced a separation from the social concerns that fueled that music, and as a result, his themes have narrowed: eroticism, on the one hand ("Sexual Healing" is a sort of polemic for the power of rampant humping, which is strange, since Gaye claims to have abstained for the past three years), and an obligatory, somewhat desperate nod to Jesus (in the liner notes and the dedication that opens the final track).

On the other hand, Midnight Love is a consequential record, a fact that has something to do with another kind of ambition. In a period when most performers are content to stake out a narrow corner of the marketplace, Marvin Gaye demands center stage and is determined to hold it. That Gaye not only commands our attention so forcefully but that he commands it so effortlessly should remind us that he has been one of our most underrated musical forces for a long time (probably since "Pride and Joy" in 1963). No one who hears "Sexual Healing" will doubt this. But then, no one who has heard "Hitchhike," "Ain't That Peculiar," "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," "I Heard It through the Grapevine," "Let's Get It On," "Inner City Blues" or any of about a dozen others should ever have forgotten it.

hen a rock star dies in a plane crash or from an overdose of drugs and alcohol, the accident may seem tragic or repulsive, but it is still comprehensible. When one of the finest artists and bravest men of our generation is shot down on his doorstep by a fan with a gun, the mind reels in disbelief. Such an act is, at first, senseless and incomprehensible, but it is a mistake to think it is meaningless. Unless we are prepared to probe beneath the ugly surface of John Lennon's murder, and to face the more grotesque ugliness underneath, his death will have been worse than senseless. It will have been futile.

This has nothing to do with the bogus interpretations that some TV commentators and media scavengers are pushing. They would have us believe that what happened represents the end of the Sixties, the conclusion of the Beatles dream, the beginning of the Eighties. Those are nothing more than platitudes, designed to console but not to challenge or illuminate. Lennon would have hated them.

John Lennon's murder does not symbolize the irrevocable ending of the Sixties: the blood he spilled was real. And that decade ended just when the calendar says it did. Nor is his death the end of the Beatles. Lennon painstakingly laid out the facts of that situation in his "Working Class Hero" interview (RS 74 and 75) a decade ago, and one of the frustrations of his life was that so few people paid him any heed. Finally, he was most certainly killed not by fame but by four highly unmetaphoric bullets.

The morning after the murder, director Richard Lester, who had worked with Lennon on three films, spoke on NBC's Today Show. The producers wanted tributes and easy answers. Lester gave them questions. "It seems appalling to me," he said, "that all this time no one has spoken about the problem of people having guns in America, the problem that people can shoot a man on the street...."

Tom Brokaw of Today replied that Mark David Chapman had a permit for his gun, as though that refuted Lester's point. In fact, it confirmed it. And so did Ronald Reagan's cynical remark that curbing crime in the street was more important than gun control. Reagan apparently believes that crackpots like Chapman will always be able to find the weapons with which to carry out their deranged wills. If that's true, and many people less senile than Reagan apparently believe it is, then handgun control wouldn't have saved John Lennon's life. But it is still infuriating that in the present political environment we'll probably never get the chance to find out what effect such laws might have.

In equating Lennon's murder with street crime, Reagan is saying that John Lennon died a random death. That's a lie. Lennon's murder is of a piece with the shootings not only of the Kennedys and Martin Luther King but with those of the most recent sickening cycle, which began in Guyana and grew to include Vernon Jordan, Allard Lowenstein, Harvey Milk and George Moscone.

Unless it is placed alongside those deaths, Lennon's murder doesn't make much sense. But once you place it in this context, it becomes even more terrifying. For then the message of the past two years is clear: Human life has never been cheaper. John Lennon was fighting against that idea. He represented a spirit of indomitable optimism, and even if, as Richard Lester claimed, that optimism was the product of a false vision, what we're mourning now is the end of a time when all of us held human life dear.

John Lennon broke up the Beatles and withdrew from public life for half a decade to escape the thousand little daily murders that all of us help commit. We resented him for leaving us; it is remarkable that our resentment never destroyed his spirit. But in the end we were accomplices in something worse: we established a situation that led to the destruction of the man himself. Chapman thought he was eliminating a symbol, not murdering a man. Where did he get such an idea?

Three years ago, I wrote "An Open Letter to John Lennon" in these pages, beseeching him to come out of retirement and help make sense of events. I felt pretty smart. Word of John's reaction got back to me through friends: "I don't fucking owe anybody anything. I've done my part. It's everybody else's turn now." I felt pretty small. Like most rock fans, I took it for granted that John Lennon existed to pump out entertainment, inspiration and insight. It never occurred to me, until then, that my attitude reduced someone I thought I loved and admired to the status of a vending machine.

The morning after the killing, promoter Sid Bernstein went on TV to suggest that the most fitting memorial to Lennon would be an annual superstar benefit concert. It was the same proposal Bernstein had been making for more than a year in his attempt to reunite the Beatles. When I heard about this, I was outraged. Didn't Bernstein understand that by promoting the myth of John the Savior Beatle, a man who was only one-quarter whole, he helped perpetuate the conditions in which Lennon was murdered? Didn't Bernstein know that the ultimate extension of such ghoulish Beatlemania was Mark Chapman in a combat crouch? He should have hung his head in shame, I thought, and then I remembered my "Open Letter."

When Sid Bernstein, myself or any other fan made nagging demands of John Lennon, insisting that he explain the world or reconstruct it for us, we were different from Chapman only in degree. We thought we were asking Lennon to do only what was required of a symbol. We forgot that we were dehumanizing a man.

Of course, there's a gulf of difference between Chapman and ourselves, but it is a meaningful difference only if we learn our lesson. The horror, the part of this sad story that fills me with rage more than grief, is that we will probably not learn. Unless we do, it will happen again.

here's nothing chic about the block of West Fifty-fourth Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues. Studio 54 used to be there, but it's been shuttered, and the block's film-cutting rooms, rehearsal studios and the like are on high floors of faceless buildings. Out in the street, there's only traffic and loose trash blowing around. But on one night last August, there was light and bustle till all hours as Paul Simon completed the last details of his first feature movie, One-Trick Pony. A couple of floors below him, Phil Ramone was finishing synching the soundtrack.

Perched on a stool before a Moviola, a beer in one hand, Paul Simon looked like a refugee from a Woody Allen film, improbably younger than his thirty-nine years and not a little bleak. He is clearly concerned about the fate of One-Trick Pony — which he wrote, scored and stars in, and which his business manager produced — but he is definitely collected. Awkwardness and vulnerability belong to his public persona, not his private one.

The movie was brought in several weeks later, at about $1 million over budget (which was in the $6 million to $7 million range), but still close enough to the mark that Simon retained control of the final cut, a privilege few filmmakers are ever granted.

Additionally, "Late in the Evening," the first single from his new album and, not coincidentally, the song that plays over the movie's title sequence, jumped onto a record number of Top Forty radio stations in its first week. Despite the five years that have elapsed since Still Crazy after All These Years, he has obviously lost none of his hitmaking touch.

Still, One-Trick Pony, the movie, is a chancy proposition. It is a rock-oriented film in a season when such projects are generally on the wane. More important, the story of a one-hit journeyman rocker named Jonah Levin, his broken marriage and traveling band (Stuff — Richard Tee, Eric Gale, Tony Levin and Steve Gadd) is a low-key and dispassionate look at the least glamorous aspects of rock: the seamy center of a career when it's been a long time since your last hit and the trends have started to pass you by.

In this way, the immediate success of "Late in the Evening" is ironic. Jonah Levin never had it so good (which is one thing that's presented a problem for many who've seen the picture). But Simon wanted Jonah Levin to be typical in a way that his creator never was.

"Not since I was a kid have I played in a band," he says a few days later, over coffee in Rockefeller Center. "It's odd to have been in rock & roll all this time and never really been part of a band. I was part of a duo — a vocal duo — and I played with studio musicians. So I was never part of that life in that way, and that is an essential part of rock & roll. I only know it by being with people who are in it. But I never lived it."

But One-Trick Pony doesn't really try to capture Levin's life on the road, even though the sequences with the band (onstage and off) are among the movie's best. What it's really about is what Paul Simon's life (or the life of someone like him) might have been like had "The Sound of Silence" been a one-shot hit, rather than the beginning of a successful career. Because Levin's personality is so closely patterned after Simon's, it's tempting to think that One-Trick Pony is autobiography. It isn't, but it is revealing of its creator's personality.

That night in the mixing room. Phil Ramone was working on the film's original ending, which differed drastically from what Simon wound up with. In that first version, Levin apparently reconciles with his wife. Quoting some memorably corny lines from the monologue in "Are You Lonesome Tonight?," the old Presley hit, he tells her that the band has broken up. But that scene immediately jumps to Jonah and the band onstage, playing "Ace in the Hole." Sneak-preview audiences in Denver and New Haven apparently found this ambiguity thoroughly confusing, but a little reflection spells out the message easily enough: Jonah Levin will never quit. What happens in the release print is more certain — and less satisfying.

That desire to have it both ways ties into something Simon said to Ramone that night during a discussion of Billy Joel's Glass Houses. "Well," Paul said in that dry, deadpan tone, "I've tried to scream. But, you know...it's just not in my body to do it."

Back at Rockefeller Center, Simon amplifies this. He has been speaking of his musical roots, and why he approaches his music so eclectically, when out of the blue he flashes back to the very beginning. "One of the earliest thoughts I had concerning music — I was about fourteen, and I loved Elvis Presley. And I said to myself, 'I can never, never be Elvis Presley. I'll never be as good as Elvis Presley. So I'm never gonna do what Elvis Presley does. I'm gonna go and find somethin' else to do.' And always, what I've worked with is trying to step back and look at the limitations of...my brain, my voice, my size, my guitar playing. And given those limitations — which I can try and push, but given what they are — I try to express myself."

It's hard not to be stunned by this. Is Paul Simon the only person who learned from Elvis Presley the opposite of the common lesson: that life was about extravagance, that there were no limitations? And yet, the odd shape of Simon's version of Every Rocker's Elvis Obsession seems to be the key to One-Trick Pony. Certainly, it explains the character of Jonah Levin better than anything in the film.

The film makes three references to Elvis. Once, Marion (Blair Brown), Jonah's soon-to-be ex-wife, reminds him in the course of an argument that though he's wanted to be Elvis Presley since he was fourteen, it's time to grow up. Later, while the band is traveling in their van, they play a game called Rock & Roll Deaths, the object of which is to name as many dead rock stars as possible. The game ends when Jonah names Elvis, then adds wistfully, "Yup. He's dead all right." And finally, there is that anomalous final scene in which a tearful Jonah recites to Marion what were surely the most hokey lines of Presley's memorably maudlin career: "Honey, you lied when you said you loved me. But I'd rather go on hearing your lies than to go on living without you." Those scenes are clearly meant to suggest Jonah Levin as some sort of Elvis analogue — but one buried under so many levels of qualification and restraint (he's East Coast, Jewish and intellectual) that the source is no longer discernible.

To say that One-Trick Pony is a movie without much emotional heat is to speak in the idiom of the film itself; understatement. Sparks fly from time to time, but the characters are too damn polite to ignite them. So, the conflicts that surface — between Jonah's rock & roll dream and his wife's insistence that he give up or grow up; between Levin as a working musician and having to deal with his band as an employer; between Jonah as someone driven to make music and the kind of people who market that music; between the concept of artistry and the concept of work in general — are continually kept in check. They are vital questions, but they aren't treated that way.

This makes One-Trick Pony an interesting rock movie, since it is the only one (give or take Godard's One Plus One) that eschews flamboyance altogether. And it's nothing if not revealing of Paul Simon's personality. Remember the night he was guest host on Saturday Night Live, and he came out for the opening bit wearing a turkey suit? The joke was that though Simon might make any number of rational arguments about why a turkey costume was inappropriate, he would not simply rip it off and stomp away.

One-Trick Pony is a movie filled with people who would rather wear the turkey suit than make too much fuss. The picture has some very humorous and moving scenes--the live footage of "Ace in the Hole"; the flashbacks of "Late in the Evening" (which escapes embarrassment due to the sassy Latin brass, which knocks nostalgia into a cocked hat); the ludicrous scenes of Lou Reed, as a hack record producer, screwing up Jonah's music with wrongheaded overdubs; and of industry hotshots trying to explain the intangibles that make hits. Throughout, it's as though a radio is playing songs in Jonah's head, music that he can't play or maybe just doesn't want to, because it's too private or doesn't fit with the joints he's stuck in. Partly, this explains the muted, languid music that makes up the bulk of One-Trick Pony's score, which is divided between songs Levin performs ("One-Trick Pony," "Ace in the Hole") and those that describe his thoughts and feelings ("Late in the Evening," "That's Why God Made the Movies"). The twain don't meet.

Several critics, however, have suggested another reason why so much of Simon's music is this way: his real masters are not rock & roll and rhythm & blues greats but the Tin Pan Alley songwriters. Simon strenuously disagrees. "Pre-rock & roll pop music is the element that has had the least effect on me. There's none of the Tin Pan Alley people that I emulate. My music is recording-studio music.

"What I feel is, you take basic rock & roll as your primary vocabulary," he says. "Now, when I say basic rock & roll, I don't mean heavy metal, I mean the Fifties —doo-wop, Presley, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, the Drifters — that kind of urban R&B and rockabilly.

"Now, from there I expand to other textures and rhythms. I expand the harmonic concept, and in that sense I'm influenced a lot by the Brazilians. Jobim is a big influence on me. Also, Fifties West Coast-jazz guys like [Paul] Desmond, Miles Davis, [Dave] Brubeck — that harmonic way of approaching things, and also the use of different time signatures.

"So, I'll take the basic rock thing and expand it into different areas musically, and then I'll contract it back to the rock thing. Always coming back to the basics — to either gospel or rock — but goin' away so it doesn't sound like everything. It puts that earlier vocabulary in a different musical perspective.

"Lyrically, what I do is in a sense parallel to the music. I try to combine ordinary speech patterns — a vernacular way of speaking, slang, clichés — with poetic imagery. Lines that you wouldn't say in ordinary speech: 'Boy's got a heart, but it beats on his opposite side.' 'The stars were white as bones.' I try to balance that between striking visual images and ordinary speech. And ordinary speech can be used with the extended harmonic thing to create a sense of irony or contrast, while I can use a strong visual or poetic image with a basic rock & roll thing to undercut. Or I can go the other way: simple speech patterns and simple musical things. I mean, I have all those elements to play with, to see just what I want to create. If I want to say two things at once, I'll go against styles, I'll make 'em rub. I'll put background voices that sound like Jack Scott or the Crickets, and I'll use a line that doesn't sound like them."

It's unlikely that there's another songwriter of the post-Presley generation who could, or would, articulate so completely his working methodology. To some, this may smack of calculation, but it's really just a product of Simon's analytical bent. He is, after all, a man who went back to study music theory after he'd already become an established success. "I had to do that to get out of writing three- and four-chord music. I really feel that one of the most important elements of popular music is melody, and it's very hard to write melodies if you have to stay within the blues changes. Even 'Late in the Evening,' which is written on blues changes, is really not a melodic song, it's a rhythmic song."

Melody has not exactly gone out of vogue since Still Crazy after All These Years — there are Billy Joel and Michael McDonald and a new generation of black vocal groups to make sure of that — but all of the important trends (funk, disco, punk and New Wave avant-gardism) place the emphasis elsewhere. Most of this music rejects complexity in favor of a simplicity that can strike the uninitiated or unconverted as simply crude. More than most pop musicians, Simon is insulated from trends (the only time he was really trendy was in the early days of folk-rock). Nonetheless, much of his reaction to the critical response to his new album reflects an awareness of trends.

"It seems like there's great resentment whenever you try to take something simple and make it complex," he says. "It's almost as if this vision of simple is that it's naive, innocent. You know, the noble savage. And that's what they admire in rock & roll. But as an artist matures, you can't be an innocent anymore. You can't be. You would be like Peter Sellers in Being There. You must learn something, and you must try to incorporate that into the world. So, naturally, the way you see things becomes more complex. And in order to express something that's more complex, you need more tools to express it. So what's this insistence on 'It's not good old rock & roll,' as if because it's not good old rock & roll, it can't be good? It's strange, isn't it?"

What Simon is saying may apply equally to Jonah's predicament in One-Trick Pony. "Jonah Levin doesn't have the luxury that I have of sitting back and thinking about strengths and weaknesses," Simon admits. "He's out there hustling a buck. And I'm not."

Indeed, that's another factor that drastically distances Simon from the character he's created. Jonah Levin is caught up in rock & roll as a job, in a situation where it's an effort to find paying work and an agony to deal with callous record companies and a producer working to subvert him. For Jonah, just making a friend is a luxury.

That's not Paul Simon's problem. "I wanted to do something other than just record an album. I felt my choices were either to write a Broadway show or a movie. I chose the movie because I thought it would be closer to the process of recording. You get a take, and that's your take. I don't have to go in every night and see whether the cast is performing. Also, I could still record and use the movie as a score. But if I'd written a show, I couldn't have recorded my own stuff — other people would have had to sing it."

Obviously, he doesn't need the money. Simon has had a consistent string of artistic and commercial successes since "The Sound of Silence" in 1965; composing "Bridge over Troubled Waters" alone earned enough to make him financially comfortable. Then there's the new record contract he signed in early 1978 with Warner Bros. That deal meant leaving CBS, where he'd been for fifteen years, and it started a major music-industry feud (some traces of which turn up in Rip Torn's characterization of One-Trick Pony's record-company president, Walter Fox, who's treated as a pondering schlemiel). But the Warners contract also guarantees Simon substantial wealth: for his next three albums, he will reportedly make somewhere between $10 million and $15 million, with complete artistic freedom.

So unlike most rockers gone to the movies (Peter Frampton or Meat Loaf, for example). Simon isn't looking for a way to extend his career once his moment passes. Rather, he seems to have made One-Trick Pony for other reasons: because he genuinely felt the need to expand his artistic horizons, and because in the circles in which he now travels (going out with actresses like Shelley Duvall and Carrie Fisher), film is a much more acceptable medium. Even if you're not a one-hit wonder, to the showbiz elite, as long as you're primarily a recording artist, you might as well be — you haven't really made it until you've accomplished something in Hollywood.

But the virtue of One-Trick Pony is that it's so completely unlike Hollywood glamour. Like Simon's best music, it's a work in miniature, constantly withdrawing into itself, commenting obliquely, without much sense of grand gesture. In either medium, such a guarded approach can seem smug, or even arrogant (who is this upstart to make a film that takes its audience's interest so much for granted?). And there's no denying that Simon strikes a lot of acquaintances this way.

Yet, like the screams that aren't in him, reaching out for attention more boldly —behaving more obviously — is just not part of Paul Simon's character. Maybe one reason One-Trick Pony is about a loser (an anomaly, since its creator and his music are both such obvious winners) is that losers aren't obligated to be brash.

The amount of control Simon was able to exert over One-Trick Pony is extraordinary. Usually, those powers are reserved only for the biggest stars (i.e., Warren Beatty and Barbra Streisand). Simon may be a big deal on the record charts, but his previous movie experience was confined to contributing songs to The Graduate and Shampoo, and a role in Annie Hall. But the production of One-Trick Pony revolved around Simon, as screenwriter and author of the score, because his business manager, Michael Tannen, served as executive producer and because Warner Brothers' movie division financed the film only because of Simon's involvement.

This presented a problem for most of the directors Simon approached -- and he approached many before hitting on Robert M. Young. "They all wondered whether there was gonna be enough room for them to direct. I remember having a conversation with Alan Parker [Midnight Express, Fame]. He said, 'What would I do here? You wrote it, you're starring in it, and you wrote the music. I don't want to be a yes man. What would my role be?' A lot of people, I think, had that feeling. That wasn't Young's feeling, though. His ego didn't get in the way. He saw room for him to function as a director and be of help to the movie and still feel that he was, you know, in charge."

The biggest surprise, though, was Simon's decision to star. Aside from Annie Hall, a 1978 TV special and some work on Saturday Night Live, he's done no acting. Yet. Simon says, "I was the only one who had any doubts about whether I wanted to act. Warners really wasn't that interested in the project unless I acted. But I didn't know if I wanted to be so far out there, to be so vulnerable to criticism on a personal level. And I thought, well, if I write it and I write the music, that's plenty. But if I go and star in it...."

The final decision was a product of the mechanics that make casting any rock picture difficult: Jonah Levin isn't a stage singer, he's a rock singer, and with the exception of Gary Busey, there are few, if any, actors who can also sing rock. "At one point, Richard Dreyfuss and I talked about it," Simon recalls. "It couldn't be done. It would have been insurmountable, because I had to give the soundtrack to Warner Bros., and there was no way I could have Richard Dreyfuss singing on it. There was no way Dreyfuss could be in the movie and open his mouth and have my voice come out. It would be funny." In the end, Paul says, he felt he did a good job as an actor, and even enjoyed it.

So, it's disconcerting to hear Simon's response when it is suggested that One-Trick Pony should at least provide a firm foundation for his future movies. "That's true, I guess. But I'm not all that sure I wanna do another movie."

It's hard to say whether that statement is more perverse or ironic. Maybe it's neither; maybe One-Trick Pony was just a project, almost an experiment. For one thing, Paul Simon still regards himself primarily as a musician and songwriter; he resents accusations that his involvement in other aspects of the movie caused him to skimp on the score and the album. "I know how hard I worked on the music," he tells me. "And I know what's there in terms of melodies and rhythms and time changes."

But there's more to it than that. As it is for Jonah Levin, touring is a bugaboo for any performing musician approaching middle age. It's all well enough to talk about the romance of the road, but there are those souls who'd also like to participate in their children's growing up. If One-Trick Pony is a partial excuse — or explanation — for Simon's absence from the concert stage in recent years, then the concept of creating musical projects that work on the screen has a built-in attraction. Theoretically, such work might replace touring. In practice, it doesn't work out that way. Simon says he regrets how little time he's been able to spend, since shooting began, with his son. Harper, who turned eight in early September. Harper, of course, lives with Simon's ex-wife (just as Jonah Levin's son, Matty, lives with his mother), which makes matters even more difficult.

As it happens, Simon is doing a concert tour anyway, to promote the film. It's brief, just a six-week swing around the States. But because Paul is working with a thirteen-piece band and enough electronic tonnage to restage D-day, it involves a couple weeks of pretour rehearsals.

Simon describes the tour as "virtually sold out and way in the red. There's no way I can even come close to breaking even." Others estimate he might lose as much as $300,000 on the tour — only about one-tenth of his record advance, but still not exactly economic good sense.

So what's the point? "Well, the point is... I haven't been out there in a while. I haven't made money on a tour in ten years, not since Simon and Garfunkel. I should go out there. I'd like to go out there. I'd like to take this band and have a record of it — you know, these guys, at this particular moment, 'cause I don't know if we'll all be together again. It's the movie; it's the album; it's everything."

Mostly, though, it's the movie. One-Trick Pony isn't a sure shot at the box office by any means. Warners was slow to schedule its opening, which is never a good sign. But it's a film that deserves to be seen, and as the central creative figure, it's up to Paul Simon to enhance every possibility. Thus, a tour and the film's new, compromised ending.

Yet, one also knows that Simon wants to play again — maybe even that he needs to. A few days before we spoke at Rockefeller Center, Simon was running the band through the new set in a huge soundstage on Fifty-second Street. The scene was streamlined chaos: packing cases towering to the vast ceiling, Phil Ramone's kids toying with Richard Tee's keyboards between songs, secretaries keeping the phones lit up, various crew members testing out equipment.

In the midst of this madness, Simon was working on a medley of "Kodachrome," with a modified reggae accent, and Chuck Berry's "Maybelline," swinging and (of course) understated. Simon was toying with the words of the original greatest hit, sliding off the lines where Berry had punched them home, tinkering with the rhythms, loosening the song up, letting out some slack. Sprung on you like that, flowing so easily out of the nice bright colors of his own song, it was the best kind of surprise. Not necessarily good old rock & roll, you know, but good and rocking. Just your ordinary rhythm & blues, your basic rock & roll. And Paul Simon was up there with an easy grin on his face. As if to say, he'll never quit. 


As a fundamentally religious artist, Pete Townshend fashions his music from sermons and confessions. Though it's not an easy thing for intellectuals to admit, this is well within the limits of rock & roll tradition. From the beginning, rock has been a music that's attracted evangelical Protestants, lapsed Catholics, cabalistically inclined Jews and yearning acidheads.

What makes Townshend singular is his insistence on not separating his most transcendent spiritual convictions from gut-and gutter-level rock & roll. It's been suggested (by Townshend, even) that rock itself is a religion, but that's not quite right. Let's say instead that rock is a spiritual medium as much as a musical one. (Which goes a lot further toward explaining its uncanny hold on the devout than any social or political explanation I've yet heard.) For Pete Townshend then, playing rock & roll well becomes an act of grace, while playing rock & roll badly is a brutal test of faith.

Townshend has been in a near-continuous state of spiritual crisis since Tommy, and you'd think that his feelings of self-pity and remorse (which have dominated later Who LPs) would have been intensified by the deaths of Keith Moon and "the kids" in Cincinnati. But he seems to have been strengthened rather than weakened by such overt turmoil, and the result is that he speaks with tremendous clarity here. If Empty Glass' very title questions Townshend's worthiness to receive grace, the shape of his music leaves no question that he's willing to accept whatever fills the cup.

Empty Glass contains the least stiff-necked music that Pete Townshend has made in ages. Indeed, you'd have to go back to The Who Sell Out to find him so consistently self-confident. All this comes through in both the song structure, where he toys with sixteenth- and thirty-second notes as well as standard rock & roll chords, and in the arrangements, where guitars and keyboards no longer fight for space but simply fill in where appropriate. When Townshend wanted to go jazzy on Who Are You, he felt it necessary to cast the compositions in the form of apologies. Now he rocks more freely, and when he does stretch out, he simply gets on with it. Empty Glass may be an album without much innocence (not even in "Rough Boys," the rousing rocker dedicated to his children and the Sex Pistols), but that's only because Pete Townshend is past the point where he can fake acceptance. You can hear it in his vocals, which are the most — and probably the only — assured ones he's ever done.

Thus does Townshend the preacher step down from his pulpit to wander once more through his peculiar parish. And we don't have to wait long for his first pronouncement: "Gonna get inside your bitter mind," he sings in "Rough Boys." No longer trapped between an ocean of transcendence and a bog of misery, Pete Townshend is far less insulated these days. When he sings the aforementioned line, in the same quavering voice he used for the "teenage wasteland" verse of "Baba O'Riley," he's talking not only about the Sex Pistols and his own kids but also about his mind. Whenever he's being introspective here, Townshend slips into his "teenage wasteland" style and sings very softly.

"I Am an Animal," which declares Pete Townshend "Queen of the fucking Universe," might be the only good joke on the LP (except for the cover, where he sits with halo and brandy bottle, hubris incarnate). But coming on the heels of "Rough Boys," it encapsulates the record's tensions: songs of reality and songs of spiritual imagination, songs of doubt and songs of faith, songs of experience and songs of devotion. What's missing (again) is innocence, and it's about time he's lost that. For quite a while now, Townshend has been threatening to dispense with the pose that he never really knew what both hands were up to, what actions they were taking. He's certainly done so here. Empty Glass isn't just an album with vaguely religious connotations. It's as consciously spiritual as any rock & roll record ever made.

Not that everything is exactly what it seems. Pete Townshend remains rock's master illusionist. The love songs, especially "Let My Love Open the Door" and "A Little Is Enough," might sound purely romantic on the radio, yet their imagery is shaped by religion. (Whose body is so "edible," after all, as the Lord's?) But just as surely, "I Am an Animal" shows us two sides of Townshend: one, the devout disciple of Meher Baba, imagining God's imagining the world; the other, the scourge of hotel rooms, explaining his recklessness and inconsistencies.

Empty Glass' two most-discussed tunes, "Jools and Jim" and the title track, are no less deceptive. "Jools and Jim" (nice Truffaut pun there) could simply be Townshend's aural poison-pen letter to the New Musical Express' rock-critic enfants terribles, Julie Birchill and Tony Parsons. Yet whether intentionally or not, Pete Townshend's rage is finally more far-ranging as he delivers a scathing critique of the puritanical and self-righteous streak in the New Wave. This is Townshend the rock critic at his best, spewing out lines like "You listen to love with your intellect" and "They have a standard of perfection there/That you and me can never share" with frightening urgency. Just as the furiously punkish drumming that kicks off "Jools and Jim" symbolizes the end of his defensiveness toward punk's usurpation of the spotlight, the quiet verse in which Townshend confesses his own hypocrisy establishes his determination to let no one off the hook.

"Empty Glass" is a complex attempt to resolve the questions posed by the final verse of "Jools and Jim." On one level, it's an extension of the dialogue, begun in "The Punk Meets the Godfather," between an old rocker and a new one (or what's left of the elder's idealism, which comes down to the same thing). But juxtaposed as it is with "A Little Is Enough," "Empty Glass" suggests Townshend's acceptance of new limits to his role playing (and new vistas in his songwriting: the opening synthesizer notes of "A Little Is Enough" evoke nothing so much as the voices of the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind).

Just as important, "Empty Glass" provides Pete Townshend's extremely condensed rock & roll version of the Book of Ecclesiastes (not so ironically subtitled "The Preacher"). Ecclesiastes, of course, is one long rant about the futility of everything under the sun, particularly human creation. To a Who fan, it can read like the secret liner notes to The Who by Numbers.

As a confessional, however, "Empty Glass" offers little that we don't already know. The second verse — in which Townshend declares, "All I need's a mirror/Then I'm a Star" — is probably just penance for snipping a similar lyric out of the Who's version of "Who Are You" (it exists in a demo treatment). Yet as an act of faith and a call to action, the song is a lot more, because it goes well beyond the superficial rendering of Ecclesiastes suggested in the opening stanza ("Life is useless").

 

In a way, Ecclesiastes offers two texts for "Empty Glass." The lines in the first chapter about "One generation passeth away and another generation cometh ... and there is no new thing under the sun" are obvious enough. The second text is more significant. It appears at the very end of the book: "Vanity of vanities saith the preacher; all is vanity. And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge; yes, he gave good heed, and sought out and set in order many proverbs."

There's little there that couldn't be puzzled out from an Eddie Cochran single: the pointed pointlessness of life is precisely why there ain't no cure for the summertime blues. What's really important here is Pete Townshend's ability to express his reconciliation with futility in rock & roll terms (he matches the Bible almost symbol for symbol). Like a lot of the greats, Townshend has had to live down a certain sense of shame about the worth of the genre itself. One measure of Empty Glass' success is that he seems to have crossed that hurdle now. Or to put it in the words of the LP's concluding (and most Who-like) rocker: "Gonna get ya anyway."

Sure, there's an inevitable catch, which is that we've heard bold declarations from this quarter before. It remains to be seen whether Townshend can carry out such brave promises in the next test of his career: reestablishing the Who as an ongoing creative entity. But if Empty Glass suggests anything, it's that the new Who music might be very different, without sliding into the pomposity of "Music Must Change." Pete Townshend's current songs are mostly quiet declarations, not strident ones — another sharp departure from his past. And, after all, those of us who still hold out much faith and devotion for rock & roll at this point must grasp at any straw. The ones offered here are far stronger than most, because they're bonded with real love.

It goes almost without saying that Sly Stone's early songs (from "Dance to the Music" through "Hot Fun in the Summertime") were inspired and prophetic, a mixture of rock and soul that united white and black audiences as effectively as anything since Elvis Presley's first recordings.

What happened later might be tragedy, or it might be farce. Though some of it (1971's There's a Riot Goin' On, a more chilling and perceptive parable of stardom than anything that punk ideologues have yet managed) was even more awesome than the initial hits, most was at best uneven, at worst discomfiting and desperate. How this story will come out, given the renewed evidence of these two albums, is perhaps still undecided — though if you really believe that, you're clearly as incurable an optimist as Sly himself.

Ten Years Too Soon is, of course, both embarrassing and a little degrading. Epic's management perceived (quite correctly) that Sly's best early tunes paved the way for all the present-day innovations in black pop, and assigned John Luongo to "remix" seven of these classics into disco style. But Luongo did much more than remix: he hasn't just altered and extended the original tracks, he's also bootlegged a completely new rhythm track in several places. While this can be remarkably listenable — there's so much high-wire tension in the vocals and surface instrumentation that even trifling with the very bedrock of the Family Stone's sound leaves music that's exciting and way ahead of its time — it's historically and artistically unconscionable.

"Everyday People" is robbed of its anthemic warmth, which was conveyed at least as powerfully by Gregg Errico's drumming and Larry Graham's bass playing as by Rose Banks' electric singing. "Stand!" becomes a boogie march rather than a humanistic call to arms, while "You Can Make It if You Try" is simply distorted beyond recognition. Only the most minor songs here — "I Get High on You" and "This Is Love" — are in any way "improved" by Luongo's illicit craftsmanship, and any sense of "improvement" probably has as much to do with hearing these relatively minor Sly compositions in a fresh context as it does with the new ornamentation.

Epic might argue that this is the only way to find a new audience for such indispensable music, but that argument is ultimately fraudulent and self-serving. If the label really had so much faith in Sly's avant-gardism, it should have taken a shot on merely rereleasing the material in its original form. This way, commercial success or failure proves nothing. Worse, Sly's now been treated to the kind of distortion that Hank Williams, Buddy Holly and Jimi Hendrix were subjected to by their recording corporations after their deaths, which means that the artistic evidence has been irreparably besmirched (since this LP is liable to linger in the CBS catalog long after the real thing is gone). The final insult is that Sly's still alive. He has to sit back and watch while his finest accomplishments are treated like fast food, while his very name is treated as a historical relic.

Though many of us had almost completely given up on ever seeing Sly Stone make decent music again (indeed, his name is often uttered in the casualty lists), Back on the Right Track suggests there's life in him yet. True, the new record — Sly's umpteenth don't-worry-about-a-thing-I'll-be-okay album title — is skimpy: there are only eight tunes and about twenty-seven minutes of music here. And there certainly isn't a single song that ranks with "Dance to the Music," "Everyday People," "Thank You Falenttinme Be Mice Elf Agin" or his other great hits.

What there is, though, is better music than this artist has made on any of his last two or three Epic LPs: music that concedes very little to current trends. Back on the Right Track is nowhere near as exciting as Ten Years Too Soon, but at least it sounds like Sly. While no wild, dancing epiphanies break through to rank with "Stand!" or "I Want to Take You Higher," there's an ample quantity of the languid philosophizing that was always the Family Stone's alternate groove.

"Remember Who You Are," which opens the record, is a reminder that Sly's most effective moralizing was always self-directed. And "The Same Thing (Makes You Laugh, Makes You Cry)" might be just the cut to put a cap on all his recriminations about backsliding. Let's face it, Sylvester Stewart is never going to go straight, and he's never going to look back and make the kind of music he made in the days before There's a Riot Goin' On. Once you understand that the "riot" is permanent, forgetting about it is not one of the options. Neither is ignoring or denying it. All you can do is deal with it — and that hurts. On Back on the Right Track, as on all Sly's post-There's a Riot Goin' On work, pain is the central theme. (That's why the only song that doesn't ring true on either album under discussion here is the forced and strident "Sheer Energy.")

Mostly, Sly is still trying on poses: the shrug-it-off sensibility of "Who's to Say?" versus the militance of "If It's Not Addin' Up...." Sure, it's usually all too obvious that these are just poses, that Sly Stone isn't really certain where he stands in relation to his own genius, blackness, catastrophic career errors or even his music. But there's hope now also, if only because he avoids the most disastrous postures. Sly never whines — any California country-rock singer is more bitter, and with a lot less cause — and he never portrays himself as a victim, or as a survivor. In his own mind, he's better than that: not merely a survivor but a winner and a star, a man who's seen the top and the bottom and almost all the places in between. If he's momentarily — or permanently — stranded somewhere in the middle, at least he's honest about it.

I'll continue to listen to whatever Sly Stone sings, hoping he'll fight his way out, knowing he'll never stop trying. Because that's the lesson of his greatest music, and such a lesson must never be lost or forgotten. He hasn't. Don't you.

What seems to be is always better than nothing — The Doobie Brothers, "What a Fool Believes"

The only thing that's certain about 1979 is that it was a platinum disaster for the record business. But artistically, this year was the most appropriate ending for the Seventies: every signal has been ambiguous, every trend obscured by an overlapping one. "We dress like students, we dress like housewives, or in a suit and a tie," sings Talking Head David Byrne in "Life during Wartime." "I changed my hairstyle so many times now, I don't know what I look like." The mirror says we look a mess — tattered, shattered — yet somehow still dancing.

As 1979 blurs into the Eighties, everyone is talking about the supposed death of disco and a resurgence of rock & roll, spearheaded by a new New Wave of "young, entertaining" bands, more businesslike and witty than the "dinosaurs" they're replacing. And the West Coast singer/songwriters who made the dominant nondance music of the past five years and who helped make radio so soft are also in a slump.

What happened in 1979 was not as simple as that. You can say that the first six months belonged to disco (if records as tradition-bound as Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive" or as antsy as Rod Stewart's "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" can be construed as disco) and that the last six months belonged to the brave young rockers (if bands as old-fashioned as Dire Straits or as elderly as Cheap Trick can be called brave and young).

But you'd be leaving out a good deal, especially about disco. George Meyer of the tip sheet Walrus called it "the biggest turntable hit in history," meaning that disco's dominance of radio airplay did not deliver record sales, at least not in the expected quantities. Yet this death-of-disco argument ignores the brilliantly crafted rock-disco that's represented by Donna Summer's "Hot Stuff," with its phalanx of surging, Stones-style guitars; by the Doobie Brothers' "What a Fool Believes," the closest we came to an anthem all year; and by "Pop Muzik" by M, which for the apocalyptically inclined serves as the last word on this particular style. (In retrospect, the Stones' "Miss You" seems absolutely prescient, and predictably so — if nothing else, the Stones are always atop the trends.)

And what about this claim that brave new rock & rollers — the Cars, Cheap Trick, the Knack, Dire Straits — are taking the place of such elders as Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin and Bob Dylan? At year's end, every one of those old-timers was in the Top Ten, effortlessly dominating airplay. What the industry knows, and the fan rarely considers, is that the Knack, Number One during the summer months, did not sell as many records as Led Zeppelin, Number One during the back-to-school buying season. The real question is whether the Knack could have made it to the top of the charts had Led Zeppelin (or the Eagles or Fleetwood Mac) been around at the same time. No one knows.

What we do know, though, is that the commercial success of the New Wave movement was not signaled by the ascent of the Knack's "My Sharona" to Number One last summer, but by 1978 hits by the Cars and the even more outré Talking Heads. Like the gold LPs earned by Elvis Costello, Cheap Trick and Dire Straits, the Knack's success is confirmation of a trend, not the beginning of a new one.

As for the older bands, the real point about them may be that, despite their broad-based commercial success, Led Zeppelin, the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac (like the Who, Bob Dylan and Neil Young) are essentially irrelevant to trends. Commercially, they are unaffected by shifting popular tastes. Artistically, they no longer set pop style by themselves; New Wave and disco are implicitly or explicitly a rejection of superstar music.

Curiously, with the exception of Led Zeppelin (which has never been typical of anything but itself anyway), all the established stars listed above have responded to the challenge from the New Wave and disco crowds. Bob Dylan recorded Slow Train Coming with two members of Dire Straits, a group whose music is based on a style he discarded a decade ago. And Kiss tried to slug out heavy metal to a disco beat. Even the new albums by Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles, bands whose commercial futures are utterly secure, reflect these pressures. The Eagles have incorporated their version of disco rhythm and the raw edge of hard rock into their usual harmony blend on The Long Run, and with Tusk, Fleetwood Mac has made an album that's remarkably less burnished than 1977's Rumours. But although people are buying The Long Run and Tusk, they'd rather have had part two of Hotel California and Rumours.

What does this say about the future of such bands? It may be that the punks are right about superstar rock--that once bands get this big, they are trapped. Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles may have to forego experimentation, or else continue in the certain knowledge that half the audience will dislike them no matter what they do, and the other half would prefer something … milder. In the long run, rock's superstars may have painted themselves into a tight little corner.

Talking to a New York program director recently, I got this list of artists his AOR station was programming less frequently or not at all: America, Chicago, Hall and Oates, Elton John, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt, Seals and Crofts, Simon and Garfunkel, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, James Taylor, Cat Stevens and Stevie Wonder.

By itself that list means little, except that radio was cleaning its closet. Wonder, Joel and Simon hadn't released new albums in a long time; some of the others were past their commercial peak and would have been dropped from the playlists anyway. As competition becomes fiercer, each station must settle for a narrower demographic range. Right now the goal is males, ages eighteen to thirty-four, who buy the kinds of products AOR stations are likely to advertise. The artists on that list who don't seem to belong there — Ronstadt, Simon, Joel, Wonder, Taylor —  have greater appeal to people who are older, younger or female.

The antidisco movement, which has been publicized by such FM personalities as notorious Chicago DJ Steve Dahl, is simply another programming device. White males, eighteen to thirty-four, are the most likely to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks and Latins, and therefore they're most likely to respond to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security. It goes almost without saying that such appeals are racist and sexist, but broadcasting has never been an especially civil-libertarian medium.

In times when straight pop music is boring or ineffectual, minority tastes — rock, soul, disco — prosper because the mass audience drifts away. The failure of artists like Joel and Simon to release any new music left mainstream pop in the doldrums. Disco was the first choice to fill the resulting vacuum. That's why so many radio stations rushed to change their formats, why certain rock acts (The Kinks!? The Beach Boys!?) tried to make disco crossover music. But disco didn't do the job — for rock acts and record companies the sign was sluggish sales; for radio stations, disco pulled in an audience that was older, younger, more female or less affluent than desired. And it was easy enough to see that stations that had stuck to hard rock — KMET in Los Angeles, for instance — were prospering in just the demographic areas radio needed.

So rock rose. But it would be foolish to think that the release of records by Simon, Joel, Wonder and Ronstadt wouldn't push a lot of the new rock & roll right off the airwaves again. Melody beats the big beat every time, which is the reason Simon and Garfunkel outsold the Rolling Stones in the Sixties. Trust this argument; history is on its side.

Less trustworthy, but worth considering: in the Seventies, a new kind of rock band developed that managed to sell its members as role models to the younger rock audience. But Grand Funk is gone, Alice Cooper's career is in limbo, Aerosmith is on the wane, and "I Was Made for Lovin' You," however effective its disco beat, must have eroded Kiss' credibility with its hardcore fans. Such acts are meant to be outgrown, and they can't convert the next generation — there is nothing more obnoxious than your older brother's favorite band, except maybe your younger brother's favorite band. Along with old-line sounds — as exemplified by Foreigner — the Knack, the Cars and Cheap Trick appeal to this segment of the audience, too.

But there's nothing remotely "new" about what these bands are doing; once more, the New Wave is filling a market void, not instigating a revolution in pop-music taste. The people who might do that--the Clash, to cite an extreme example--are still largely unheard by the pop audience.

Which is not to suggest that nothing at all is happening.

Call what remains a report from the front; what a fool believes; what any man could learn by paying attention to the radio:

There was the week last winter when Elvis Costello came out with Armed Forces, a record so brave it couldn't be true; the week he called Ray Charles a nigger, I knew that it wasn't… Listening all summer long to Donna Summer's "Hot Stuff" and finally deciding that the Stones should have had her produce Some Girls… Watching the kids at the beach with their Cheap Trick tapes, spinning "Surrender" twenty times a day… Blowing my last five bucks on Van Morrison's Into the Music and feeling cheered up… Playing Sly Stone's new record, which was like running into a dear old friend... Seeing The Kids Are Alright and starting to cry when Keith Moon made that sudden, awful change from indestructible youth to fatigued old age… Discovering Peaches and Herb's "Reunited" on the radio one Sunday morning and stopping the car, breathless that soul music still lived…  Gaping at James Brown dancing at his own press party… Neon Leon at the Mudd Club, Beaver Brown at the Fast Lane, Ellen Shipley in Poughkeepsie, Carolyne Mas at the Other End.

Most of all, I remember two weeks in September when I saw the Who three times, followed by Bruce Springsteen and then, out in L.A., the Talking Heads. The Who told me that the old ways are sustaining: Townshend played his heart out, Kenney Jones fit like a glove, and I was as awed by them as if they were a new band. Bruce Springsteen playing at the MUSE shows inspired in me what he always does: the faith that this moment can be as magic as my memories. And the Heads played with the ferocity of a band that's learned its skills from six months on the road--a joyous, crazy show that lived up to the others on a night when I would have asked for nothing more than entertainment. Better than my dreams, those moments.

But I would trade them all, and all the rest I haven't mentioned, for the time at the breakfast table when my eight-year-old daughter walked in singing the "new" song she'd heard on TV: "Hearts of Stone"--not by the Stones or Springsteen but by Otis Williams and the Charms. At times like that, I don't want to revolutionize the radio, or even hear the new-new New Wave — I just wanna dance.

n the sixties, American rock & roll kids grew up with an image of England as a land whose streets were littered with electric Gibsons and souped-up Marshalls – a paradise. There was plenty we missed or looked at without comprehension, Mod most of all. To most Yanks, Mod meant Carnaby Street, a clothing fad – like Macy's selling punk haberdashery – or the music of such pre-power-pop bands as the Who and Small Faces. It was only later, if ever, that we discovered that the flashy Carnaby Street gear would never have done (Mods wore mohair suits and pinstripe shirts, not fancy polka dots), and that what was really being played in the clubs was the full-tilt R&B of Geno Washington and the Ram Jam Band, a lot of Motown and cooler British R&B singers like Georgie Fame.

If we read about the bash-ups between Mods and Rockers at Brighton Beach on bank holidays, they seemed to have no more to do with the scene than the rumbles you could find without trying in the parking lot of any stateside drive-in. But Quadrophenia, both in the Who's original LP version (1973) and in the new film directed by Franc Roddam, certainly makes those brawls seem significant. For Pete Townshend, at least, Mod was a turning point between the time when rock and all that went with it could be a momentary kick, and the era when the Moment became institutionalized as a lifestyle – a lifestyle personified by the Who.

Album Review: Quadrophenia

In a more general way, Quadrophenia rebuffs the idea that this epoch's rock ought to be (or ought to return to) just plain fun. When Jimmy (the central character, played by Phil Daniels) and others like him can no longer stop at the weekend – when the collective frenzy of the Brighton action becomes desirable all week long – rock stops being just a leisure-time propellent. As a result, the fourth side of the Quadrophenia soundtrack, a selection of old hits by girl groups and soul masters, seems so quaint. At the very least, the institutionalization of "fads" like Mod spelled the end of innocence in rock – and once lost, innocence, like virginity, can never be regained. (So much for the Knack.)

The original Quadrophenia LP failed to articulate any of these ideas. Part of the problem was Kit Lambert and Pete Townshend's quirky, lavishly detailed production, which left Roger Daltrey's voice naked above the band. Worse, Townshend's story line was no more coherent than the one he used for Tommy. The film script at least gives the movie a strong narrative base (the visualization of "5:15" is particularly striking), but Roddam's direction does have problems: the motivations of these characters are never completely explained, and this is a movie about motive. Unless you're a terminal Anglophile or Who fan, what goes on doesn't consistently make sense, although it all adds up at the end when Jimmy metaphorically smashes his guitar.

Quadromania: The Who Fuss, Fight and Hit the Road

Oddly, given the flaws of the original album, the new soundtrack LP for Quadrophenia gets its point across precisely because of the music. I can't think of another rock movie in which the songs supply so much of the narrative – Tommy wasn't a rock movie – and the new recordings and remixes of the older material lend the songs the punch they've always missed, onstage as well as on the original LP. "5:15" now sounds like the hit single it was always meant to be, and Roger Daltrey's singing on both that song and "Love Reign O'er Me" make him sound as tough as he's always acted like he thought he was. (The musical equivalent, I suppose, of an American Grandstand that actually made rude noises and then punched you in the lip.)

Like the Who's recent shows at Madison Square Garden, Quadrophenia is special for the group's fans, if only because it promises that the group can carry on at its old energy level (something that's hard for a lot of us to admit, but can't be ducked once you stare it in the face). But even for people who don't care much about the Who or what really happened in Britain during the middle Sixties, there's a lot to be learned from this picture about what happened to rock in general. To anybody who doesn't care about rock, Quadrophenia will be completely meaningless, which is another kind of recommendation, if you think about it.

This story is from the November 29th, 1979 issue of Rolling Stone.

In the beginning, Cheap Trick was lovable because they tried to pull off the toughest trick in the book: making rock that was both bonehead hard and intelligently witty. Rick Nielsen aspired to nothing less than the kind of working-class-hero reputation he'd found in role models like Pete Townshend and John Lennon. In the band's finest moments — Heaven Tonight, In Color and, especially, the awesome in-concert version of "Surrender" that's the centerpiece of Cheap Trick at Budokan — you can hear his absolute joy at discovering that such an approach worked. The live "Surrender" isn't rock & roll at the edge, but way past it. Cheap Trick sings and plays this nonsense story (which isn't really nonsense) with the same fervor that the Beatles brought to the live "Twist and Shout" on The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl. And for a lot of the same reasons, which boil down to one: triumph.

For better or worse, "Surrender" also had the effect of raising the stakes: Cheap Trick must now deliver on the promise of their first three studio albums. While there's no question about Nielsen & Company's stature among American hard-rock bands — these guys are among the brightest ever — there are some doubts about what they can do with their potential. Dream Police is an unsatisfactory record mostly because it ducks such issues in favor of reworking familiar territory. (Perhaps if Cheap Trick at Budokan had been released in Japan only, as originally intended, this wouldn't be the case. Yet the group has had as much time to deal with the consequences of accidental success as its listeners have.)

Rick Nielsen has never been shy about letting his sources show, but maybe he's gone too far here. You can actually work Dream Police like a puzzle, ascribing a specific antecedent to almost every vocal and instrumental idea. The title track, for example, simply revisits "Surrender" with Ray Davies-style singing. "The House Is Rockin' (with Domestic Problems)" is derived from the dense, chordal rock of the late-Sixties Beatles ("I Want You," "Helter Skelter"), with the added fillip of a guitar tag from "Thank You Girl." "Gonna Raise Hell," another variation on "Helter Skelter," features a string chart and some Abbey Road-inspired layered voices. "Need Your Love" is a better version of the Who meets Free than Bad Company has ever managed — but that's about all it is.

It's not that these songs are bad. (Only "Voices," a ballad from a band that has absolutely no facility for ballads, is disastrous.) Indeed, several of them — particularly "Dream Police," "Way of the World" and "I'll Be with You Tonight" — are nearly as good as the earlier ones in which Cheap Trick used similar stylistic devices.

Still, Dream Police isn't as exciting as Heaven Tonight or In Color. The reason has something to do with the LP's production style. Previously, producer Tom Werman and the group created a sound that was both distinctive and about as discreet as a fist in the face. (And when somebody is punching as hard as Cheap Trick, you don't exactly have time to sit around counting the hairs on their knuckles.) The new album, on the other hand, is almost obsessively concerned with details, so you find your attention shifted to parts rather than the whole. As record making, it's state-of-the-art, but as rock & roll, it escapes boredom only because of the band's relentless charge: the way guitarist Nielsen and drummer Bun E. Carlos work off each other will never be boring.

But one of the problems with Cheap Trick has always been that they're more listenable than compelling. (Another reason why the live "Surrender" is so great is that it makes you care that Mommy's all right.) You can't help admiring the sardonic humor and thrilling attack of these songs, yet it's a hell of a job working up much emotion about them. Maybe what I mean by saying that "Surrender" raised the stakes for this LP is that it's time for these musicians to move beyond their perfect craftsmanship.

They're trying, I think. Dream Police seems intended as a sort of statement (at least it contains a lyric sheet, which none of the group's other studio records have) and is organized around a couple of themes, mostly fame and paranoia. The altered production approach also seems designed to encourage a more "artistically serious" view of Cheap Trick, and to distance them from the shallow waters of Aerosmith, Foreigner, Kiss and Bad Company.

That's a whole other problem. Cheap Trick offers the illusion of substance — Nielsen's winking jests and sly nonsense tunes are a parody of what lunkhead rock is supposed to be about — but Kiss, to choose a particularly monstrous example, began as a kind of parody, too. It was success that let Gene Simmons, et al., claim that American culture was really about McDonald's and Gilligan's Island, pure consumption and nothing more complicated. What Nielsen would like to do is keep his humor intact and establish himself as a thinking-man's hard rocker — something no American, with the possible exception of Ronnie Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd, has ever managed.

But the very knack Nielsen has for hiding out among the Steven Tylers and Gene Simmonses keeps him from writing with the sort of emotional commitment that Ronnie Van Zant (much less Pete Townshend and John Lennon) consistently provided. Dream Police isn't as bloated and glib as its conceits might indicate — the music cuts through a lot when it's as skillfully and intently made as this. Still, prattling about paranoia and whining about fame ("Writing on the Wall") aren't the same things as making a coherent statement about artistic identity (or anything else).

Rick Nielsen wants to be a great trash artist — and he could yet become one — but so far, the difference between the version of paranoia in. "Dream Police" and the version in Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" is the difference between a trash thriller like John Carpenter's Halloween and an expert one like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: the latter keeps every promise it makes, while the former delivers on few or none. So Cheap Trick turns Dream Police into the one thing that rock & roll should never be — a cheat. On the surface, the album seems sour, jaundiced and self-important, like the petty rock aristocrats that Nielsen pillories with his stage presence. But perhaps that's too harsh a judgment. If Dream Police is an expression of anything, it's a statement about just how confused and hollow even the most skilled rock performers can feel when they're subjected to the accelerations of the star-making machinery.

The issue isn't whether Cheap Trick can become the great American rock band we lost when Lynyrd Skynyrd's plane went down, but whether Rick Nielsen has the guts to probe deeply enough to let loose what's there. Dream Police doesn't offer any answers, yet it does suggest some dire possibilities. I hope that the deterioration I think I'm hearing is something else — maybe Nielsen really is struggling to come to terms with rock & roll's central demons — because Cheap Trick is too fine a group to be buried in the circle of hell reserved for those who had potential and squandered it.

Pink Cadillac — the sequel to John Prine's finest record, last year's Bruised Orange — is the first major album that rock & roll's original master producer, Sam Phillips, has had a hand in since the Sixties. That's why it's so painful to count it an almost unqualified disaster.

Bruised Orange (produced by Prine's Chicago crony, Steve Goodman) ran through every singer/songwriter cliché available, but it didn't matter: the starkness of the compositions, the working-class vignettes and the intensity of the performances simply overwhelmed the lackluster arrangements. Enough so, anyway, that a rockabilly session produced by Phillips' sons, Knox and Jerry, at the family studio in Memphis certainly seemed a logical next step. The involvement of Sam himself — he produced two tracks — only heightened expectations.

Pink Cadillac mars the reputation of everyone involved. Prine has never sung such a half-assed grab bag of songs, partly because he wrote so few of them (and is in no way a classic interpreter of any material except his own), partly because the outside stuff he chose is so thoroughly mediocre. (Roly Salley's "Killing the Blues" might have been better than that, if he'd ever finished writing the idea he started with.) Both "Baby Let's Play House" and "Ubangi Stomp," the two vintage Sun rockabilly items Prine tackles, are inappropriate for a performer whose best work has always been done in miniature.

When Prine does get something going — in "Saigon, "Automobile" and "How Lucky" — the recording approach destroys it. "Saigon" comes closest to working, if only because Sam Phillips gives the number an electricity that's been lacking on all of the singer's previous LPs. But Phillips also buries Prine's voice, and — as is usual here — the rhythm section is too leaden to rock. In fact, this album has the worst drum sound I've heard on any record made in the last couple of years. It's so muddled that Angie Varias might as well have been banging on shoe boxes with teaspoons.

John Prine says he was looking for raw honesty and plain-spokenness in Memphis, but that's not something he had to go out of his way to seek. It's the one thing he's always had. What the production style does is to obscure the source of his authenticity — his gravel voice and touchingly awkward phrasing — without giving us anything to replace it. And Pink Cadillac has almost nothing to do with the classic Sun records of the Fifties, which are models of recording clarity even twenty-five years later.

The problem isn't so much that Prine can't sing rock & roll as that no one here can quite imagine how to make it. So what we're left with is, at best, a hint — or worse, a rumor — of everyone's real capabilities. Like most gossip, it's distorted and unfair to the original version. You want to hear John Prine? Listen to "Angel from Montgomery" on his first LP or "Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone" from Bruised Orange. You want to hear Sam Phillips? Try Jerry Lee Lewis' "Whole Lotta Shakin'," Elvis Presley's "Mystery Train" or Billy Lee Riley's "Red Hot."

You want to get depressed? Listen to this.

widely circulated feminist poster reproduces a scarifying police photograph: a woman, dead of a botched illegal abortion, lies naked and bloody in an empty room. For a time it seemed that that image was fading, that it might actually pass into history. Now, abruptly, it is as vivid as ever. On June 20th, 1977, six white male Supreme Court justices decided that Connecticut and Pennsylvania need not pay for elective abortions with state Medicaid funds and that the city of St. Louis need not provide such operations in its public hospitals. The state still owns our bodies – unless we can afford ransom.

It is a bitter shock to wake up and find yourself losing a battle you thought you had largely won – especially when you had fought so hard and won so much in such a short time. In 1969, when feminists began making militant public demands for repeal of the abortion laws, abortion was illegal, except in special circumstances, in every state. Legislative debate on "abortion reform" was mainly confined to the issue of whether women who were sick or crazy or had been raped by their fathers deserved to be excused from forced childbearing. By 1970 the political climate had changed drastically. New York, which had resisted the most minimal "reforms," passed the most liberal law in the country: it permitted abortion for any reason during the first twenty-four weeks of pregnancy. In 1973 – after three more years of feminist demonstrations, speakouts, lobbying campaigns and lawsuits – the United States Supreme Court ruled that laws prohibiting abortion during the first six months of pregnancy violated women's constitutional right to privacy.

The Supreme Court's decision was by no means a total victory. It did not invalidate all abortion laws, and it specifically rejected the feminist contention that a woman has an absolute right to decide whether or not to bear a child. Antiabortionists quickly moved to test the limits of the decision by pushing for a whole new set of abortion statutes requiring a husband's or parent's consent, forbidding the use of public funds for abortions, permitting hospitals and medical personnel to refuse on moral grounds to provide or perform them and so on. Some states have passed blatantly unconstitutional laws (like Louisiana's law making abortion a capital crime). In other communities public officials have simply ignored the decision, and social and political pressure has ensured that abortion remains unavailable, or available only at an exorbitant price. For all too many women who cannot afford to go to a private doctor or travel to a liberal state, the right to safe, legal abortion has never been more than theoretical.

Still, the decision led to what proved a disastrous complacency. Once most middle-class women could get abortions, feminists found it difficult to generate the energy needed to keep pressing their original demand – repeal of all abortion laws. It was even harder to maintain a sense of urgency about defending what had been won. The conservative resistance – including the campaign, instigated and largely financed by the Catholic Church, to pass an anti-abortion constitutional amendment – seemed a futile rear-guard action. Legal abortion was popular; polls showed that a majority of people supported it (including a substantial percentage of Catholics). If many women concluded that the struggle was over, others forgot – or never knew – that there had even been a struggle. "I only had a vague idea that there was a proabortion movement," a woman I know said recently. "I just knew that at one point abortion was illegal, and then it wasn't."

Last year Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, which cut off federal Medicaid funds for abortion except to save the woman's life. Opponents of the amendment filed suit, and Federal District Judge John F. Dooling issued an injunction staying its enforcement. Defenders of abortion rights were also contesting the Connecticut, Pennsylvania and St. Louis regulations. Feminists and civil libertarians assumed that the Supreme Court would declare all these restrictions unconstitutional.

But another major political shift was taking place. Since Nixon's 1972 landslide, the government's rightward drift had been gaining alarming momentum. Widespread unemployment and massive cutbacks in social-welfare spending were having a particularly severe impact on women and minorities. At the same time, the fundamentalist right was mounting its defense of the patriarchal family against abortion, homosexuality and the Equal Rights Amendment. Jimmy Carter was continuing Nixon-Ford's economic policies while encouraging the sexual backlash with his opposition to abortion, his emphasis on traditional family virtues and his unctuous Christian piety. In the face of this dual reactionary assault, the women's movement – like the black movement and the left generally – was in retreat. The ERA, a broadly popular (and scarcely radical) measure, was in deep trouble; the anti-abortion movement was looking less and less like a futile rear guard. Given this ominous atmosphere and the basic conservatism of the Nixon Court, the June 20th rulings should have been no surprise.

And so, in 1977, for women without money it is 1969 again. The fact that the state is forbidden to interfere directly with a woman's right to end her pregnancy does not, in the Supreme Court's view, invalidate state policies that effectively prevent many women from exercising that right. After June 20th, the Court directed Judge Dooling to reconsider his injunction against the Hyde Amendment. In light of the Court's new rulings, Dooling lifted the injunction, ensuring that until October 1st, the end of the fiscal year (the Amendment was part of an annual appropriations bill), poor women would not be able to get abortions except in states like New York, where the state government had agreed (for the time being) to make up the difference. The House and Senate have passed two versions of a new bill outlawing federal Medicaid funds for virtually all abortions; at the time this article went to press, reconciliation of the bills and final passage were expected shortly. It is unlikely that many states will follow New York's example. The trend is exactly the opposite; over twenty states have already passed laws authorizing a cutoff of state funds for abortions. The antiabortion lobby can be expected to press for similar bans in every state.

We are facing a social crisis. Last year 300,000 legal abortions – one-third of the total – were financed by Medicaid; one-third of the recipients of Medicaid abortions were teenagers. The cutoffs will affect not only the indigent but all women who cannot manage on short notice to scrape up the $150 to $300 fee for an early abortion (late abortions are of course much more expensive). Economically dependent women who for whatever reason cannot tell parents or husbands they need an abortion are particularly vulnerable.

In addition to burdening thousands of women with unwanted babies and driving thousands of others to dangerous hacks or attempts at self-abortion, the ban on free abortions is likely to aggravate the problem of sterilization abuse – that is, the practice of sterilizing women (generally poor minority women) without adequate safeguards to assure their informed consent, and often through outright intimidation or fraud. Horror stories abound: women have been lied to about the nature or permanence of the operation or threatened with the loss of welfare payments if they did not agree; Spanish-speaking women have been induced to sign English consent forms and so on. If poor women cannot get abortions, they will be all the more vulnerable to this sort of pressure, and many women may feel compelled, for economic reasons, to resort to this irreversible alternative (which will still be financed by the state).

The Supreme Court's casuistic distinction between forbidding abortions and making them unavailable moved dissenting justices to quote, "let them eat cake," and Anatole France's observation that "the law, in its majestic equality, forbids both the rich and the poor to sleep under bridges." The allusions apply equally well to Jimmy Carter's bland defense of the Court's reasoning: "Well, as you know there are many things in life that are not fair, that wealthy people can afford and poor people can't. But I don't believe that the federal government should take action to try to make these opportunities exactly equal, particularly when there is a moral factor involved." Yet this is no routine case of class bias; the Court's argument and Carter's response are not only chilling but thoroughly disingenuous. The purpose of the Medicaid abortion ban is not to reduce aid to the poor – on the contrary, abortion is far less costly than childbirth, let alone welfare for an indigent mother and her child – but to prevent abortions. Poor women are only the most convenient immediate victims of an attack aimed at women in general. But by posing the issue in terms of rich against poor, the government can exploit antipoor, antiblack, antiwelfare sentiment while lulling middleclass women into believing their own abortion rights are safe; the result is to confuse and divide the proabortion majority.

Thurgood Marshall's dissent goes straight to the point: "Since efforts to overturn [the Court's 1973] decisions have been unsuccessful, the opponents of abortion have attempted every imaginable means to circumvent the Constitution and impose their moral choices upon the rest of society . . . I fear that the Court's decisions will be an invitation to public officials to approve more such restrictions." Another dissenting justice, William Brennan, points out that in a number of previous cases the Court explicitly rejected the notion that the state may do anything short of direct prohibition to inhibit the exercise of a constitutional right. That the June 20th decisions are no more and no less than a political capitulation to the antiabortion movement is clear from the Court's assertion that states are not obliged to "undercut" their "unquestionably strong and legitimate interest in encouraging [i.e., coercing] normal childbirth." Carter's statement is even less subtle; what it amounts to is: abortion is immoral. At the moment I can't find an excuse to impose this view on the wealthy (life is unfair). But at least I can impose it on the poor.

The antiabortionists would be delighted to even things up. In August, Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin, president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, called for an intensified drive to eliminate "the evil practice" of abortion. (He also denounced federally financed birth-control programs as "unacceptable governmental intrusion into family life.") So far, the campaign for a constitutional amendment banning abortion has failed in Congress. But eleven state legislatures (out of thirty-four needed) have voted to call for a constitutional convention to pass an antiabortion amendment. If the campaign succeeds, women will be far worse off than they were in 1969. Reproductive slavery will be enshrined as a basic principle of our legal system. It can happen here.

The Antiabortion movement argues that abortion is murder, that fetuses and embryos – even, presumably, eggs at the moment of fertilization – are human beings with a right to life. To oppose this view is not to say that abortion has no moral significance, that it is a neutral act like getting a tooth pulled. Abortion does destroy a living, genetically unique entity, a potential human being, and I would guess that few women have abortions with total indifference to that fact. On the contrary, for many women the decision to end a pregnancy is difficult and painful. But to equate abortion with murder – that is, the unjustifiable killing of a person – is another matter. That argument not only assumes that the fetus is an actual person – a claim that taken literally is as silly as calling a seed a plant – but grants fetuses an absolute right to life that even people don't have.

While it is certainly possible to argue that fetuses are as valuable as people, such an assertion cannot be proved or disproved; it is not a matter of fact but of emotional or theological conviction. Nor can any moral or social consensus be invoked in support of that conviction, which is nowhere reflected in our laws or in popular opinion. We do not hold funerals for dead fetuses or consider a miscarriage as traumatic as the death of a baby. American law has not, in the past, linked abortion with murder or set comparable penalties; American society has regarded abortion as, at worst, a vice akin to drug taking or prostitution. Millions of women – otherwise indistinguishable from the rest of the noncriminal population – have expressed their opinion on the subject by having abortions, legal or illegal. It is questionable whether even militant right-to-lifers really believe their own rhetoric – former senator James Buckley, the author of two proposed constitutional amendments defining the fetus as a person, told a Senate hearing that his amendments would not, in fact, require states to impose the same penalty for fetal "murder" as for murder of persons already born.

In any case, only committed pacifists believe that killing is never justified. Most of us assume (and our laws and international agreements reflect the assumption) that the right to life must be balanced against the right to self-defense, individual or collective, against attacks on one's life, safety, liberty or independence. Abortion is an assertion of this basic right, though in a context that is not precisely analogous to any other. Pregnancy involves a uniquely intimate relationship: the pregnant woman is required to nurture another organism with her own body. Pregnancy and childbirth are inherently a strain on a woman's system ("labor" is precisely that); complications can be distressing, unhealthy, even fatal. Having a baby transforms a woman's body, often causing permanent physical and metabolic changes. Psychically, too, pregnancy and birth are an absorbing, exhausting affair. Even women who want babies and are eager to experience pregnancy often find it difficult. For the woman who must bear a child against her will, pregnancy is a nine-month rape, a barbaric form of involuntary servitude.

But forced pregnancy is only a prelude to the oppression of forced motherhood. The same male-dominated society that passes repressive abortion laws severely restricts the freedom and independence of mothers. Mothers must typically assume the burden of child-rearing, with little or no help from fathers or the larger community. And because of job discrimination and the lack of public child-care facilities, few mothers can remain self-supporting; most are wholly or partly dependent on husbands, relatives or welfare. This combination of responsibility and dependence drastically limits – when it does not entirely destroy – a mother's ability to determine the direction of her life. The bind is worst for poor women (a category that includes most single mothers, whether or not they were poor to begin with). But for women of all classes – the mother who already has as many children as she can handle, the single woman who is passionately involved in her work, the housewife who is struggling to acquire some skills and get a job so that she can leave a bad marriage, the teenager who does not yet know who she is or what she wants – the right to abortion can mean the difference between living and existing.

Nor is the Carter administration's suggested "alternative" – adoption – a solution. To force women to produce babies is abhorrent under any circumstances. And for many women – particularly women who might want a child but for economic or other reasons cannot afford one – having to give the baby away only compounds the trauma of the pregnancy itself. In addition, giving up babies is socially taboo for married women.

The violence and urgency of women's need to get rid of unwanted pregnancies are easily measured. Laws have never stopped women from risking death and mutilation, spending huge sums of money (if they had it) or enduring the indignities of a sleazy, illicit seller's market to obtain abortions. Even when abortion is legal it is at best an unpleasant experience, an assault on the body; for many if not most women it is emotionally upsetting as well, and for some women it is a crisis. The only reason women have abortions is that the alternative is so much worse. Yet antiabortion rhetoric continually refers to "convenience" abortions, dismissing unwanted pregnancy as a mere annoyance, which in no way deserves to be balanced against the sacred life of the fetus. A less extreme (hence more insidious) version of this attitude is that abortion may be permissible, but is nevertheless a frivolous luxury.

Carter's speech suggested this theme; others have elaborated on it. Representative Elwood Rudd argued that if the government has to pay for abortions, "By that logic taxpayers can be forced by Congress to pay for poor people to have face-liftings, hair transplants, expensive cars and tickets to the Kennedy Center." In a letter to the New York Times, defending the Supreme Court, Mr. Bert S. Annenberg pointed out that the rich can "afford caviar and champagne and sail their yachts to Palm Beach . . . while the poor cannot."

To blame this let-them-eat-caviar sentiment on simple insensitivity to women's experience would be charitable. More likely it comes from understanding women's feelings only too well. Talk to antiabortionists long enough, and they invariably betray their underlying concern: to curb women's sexual freedom. Besides raising the specter of tax-supported face-lifts, Representative Rudd remarked that if a woman has a right to control her own body, she should exercise that control before she gets pregnant. Several people who have recently written me to defend the humanity of fetuses have included the observation that if you overeat you should expect to get fat, and if you have sex you should expect to get pregnant. In other words, sexual intercourse is an unhealthy excess, for which women (even married women, apparently) should be made to suffer.

Since these days it is considered a bit crude to rant about the wages of sin (at least for heterosexuals), many antiabortionists dress up the antisex argument in a seemingly plausible rationale. As Mr. Annenberg put it, "In today's era of scientific achievement there are many ways for preventing conception, which are available to all who desire them . . . " President Carter and others have expressed concern lest abortion be used as a "routine contraceptive." Leaving aside the bizarre notion that women are likely to prefer an operation to other forms of birth control, the implication here is that women (particularly black welfare mothers) get pregnant because they are lazy, irresponsible hedonists. This argument is often combined with cant about the expense to the taxpayer, but again, the arguers do not suggest cutting off Medicaid funds for childbirth; their intent is clearly to punish women for their supposed irresponsibility.

The constantly repeated assertion that women don't need abortions because they have contraceptives is a classic case of the big lie. It is fascinating that so many otherwise well-informed people manage not to know a readily available fact: there is no such thing as a perfectly reliable contraceptive. Even birth control pills, taken exactly as directed, have a small but definite failure rate, and given the documented dangers of the pill, women can hardly be blamed for switching to less effective methods. Yet over a decade or two of an active sex life using a diaphragm, IUD, condoms or foam, the chances of at least one accidental pregnancy are relatively high. It is an equally blatant lie that birth-control information and devices are "available to all who desire them." In many communities law or social pressure or both restrict access to contraceptives and accurate instructions in their use; teenagers in particular are often denied the protection they need.

It is true that women are sometimes careless about birth control, for reasons ranging from ambivalence about getting pregnant to guilt over sexual activity to immaturity to the ingrained human tendency to take foolish chances. It is also true that every act of unprotected intercourse involves a man who fails to use a contraceptive or make sure his partner uses one. Yet for antiabortionists, an unwanted pregnancy is solely the woman's failure and the woman's tough luck. There is something highly suspect about their self-righteous vindictiveness. (Imagine the same attitude applied to car accidents: "The creep went through a red light! Let him pay for his own ambulance!") Essentially, it is a cover for the fear that women are getting away with something – namely, enjoying sex on their own terms.

The right to abortion is only one aspect of reproductive freedom. Women must have access to the safest, most reliable birth-control measures our technology can devise (including voluntary sterilization); there must be an end to social pressure on women to justify their sexual activity, or their very existence, by having children. Equally important, women who want children should be free to have them – a freedom that necessarily includes the right to bring up children under decent economic and social conditions. No woman should be driven to an abortionist out of economic desperation or fear of being trapped in the home. Yet, even in the best of all possible societies, there will always be women who need abortions. Abortion is the emergency fallback, the crucial insurance against technological and human fallibility. Only an absolute right to abortion can free women from the chronic subliminal dread that at any moment we may find ourselves helplessly subject to the rule of our biology and robbed of all control over our lives. It is for this reason that the abortion struggle is so passionate on both sides: it carries all the emotional weight of the larger struggle over women's liberation.

A few days after the Supreme Court rulings, New York feminists held a meeting to plan a response to the abortion crisis. It had been a long time since I was last in a room with so many angry women. For the past few years the movement had been fragmented, confused, directionless. Now, none too soon, we were about to pull ourselves together and fight back. We had the numbers, after all; as Bella Abzug had told Village Voice writer Judith Coburn that afternoon, "We must mobilize every woman who's ever had an abortion and every woman who's ever been afraid, even for one week, that she'll need one." We began organizing what was to become the Coalition for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA). I went home plotting not only how to resist the right-wing juggernaut, but how to get on with the unfinished business of feminism. An unspeakably utopian project for 1977. And yet, if there's one thing the past eight years should have taught us, it is how fast – for better or worse – things can change.

n the spring of 1975, my brother Michael, then 24, was on his way home from his third trip through Asia when he arrived in Israel, planning to stay a few weeks before heading back to New York. On April 28th, he wrote to our parents: "I've been staying at, of all things, an Orthodox Jewish yeshiva — when I got to Jerusalem I went to visit the Wailing Wall and got invited — they hang around there looking for unsuspecting tourists to proselytize. It's sort of a Jewish Jesus-freak type outfit — dedicated to bringing real Judaism to backsliding Jews. I haven't been especially impressed by the message, but it's been a really interesting week." On June 4th, he wrote me, "I've had my lack of faith shaken."

I appreciated the ironic turn of phrase. Then its meaning hit. I read on: "I've read and talked about it enough to realize that the arguments for the existence of G-d (a spelling which shows how superstitious I'm becoming) — and the Jewish version of it at that — are very plausible and intellectually if not emotionally convincing . . . It's frightening, because while I can convince myself of the possibility and even probability of the religion, I don't like it — its 613 commandments, its puritanism, its political conservatism, its Jews-first philosophy. On the other hand, if it is the truth, not to follow it means turning your back on the truth." He was postponing his return till the end of July.

I called my parents. My mother thought I was being an alarmist — Mike couldn't be serious about religion; it was too removed from the way he'd been brought up. "He's spelling God 'G-d,' "I said. There is a religious law that you cannot destroy paper on which you have spelled out "God."

Two weeks later they got another letter: "I haven't written because I'm having trouble describing what's happening. I feel more and more that I'm trapped into a religion whose truth I can't deny . . . .I've never given much thought to the existence of G-d — my LSD experiences had (same as with Ellen) left me with the idea that there was 'something' there, but I never thought it was knowable or explainable (& if it was explainable certainly more in terms of mystical experience & Buddhism than the 'G-d of our Fathers' of Judaism). But my time here has really forced me to come to terms with what that 'something' might be. . . . I'm not Jesus-freaking out — I haven't come to this through any blinding moment of illumination or desire to be part of a group — it's been an intellectual process (which I've been fighting emotionally all the way), and I'd like nothing better than to reject it — I just don't think I'll be able to.

"The final shock in this letter is that I may not leave here at the end of July. If I accept this as the truth, I have to take time to learn about it."

The "truth" Mike proposed to accept was Judaism in its most extreme, absolutist form: the God of the Old Testament exists; He has chosen the Jewish people to carry out His will; the Torah (the Five Books of Moses and the Oral Law elaborating on them) is literally the word of God, revealed to the Jews at Mt. Sinai; the creation, the miracles in Egypt, and other biblical events actually happened; the Torah's laws, which are based on 613 mitzvos (commandments) and govern every aspect of one's existence, must be obeyed in every detail; they are eternal, unchangeable; Conservative, Reform and other revisionist versions of Judaism simply reflect the regrettable human tendency to shirk difficult obligations.

My parents had the same first impulse: "Let's go to Israel and bring him home." My father was already out of his chair and about to leave the house to go buy plane tickets when they looked at each other and decided they were overreacting. My own reaction was a kind of primal dread. In my universe, intelligent, sensible people who had grown up in secular homes in the second half of the 20th century did not embrace biblical fundamentalism — let alone arrive at it through an "intellectual process." My brother was highly intelligent, had always seemed sensible. What was going on?

My father is a retired police lieutenant; my mother is a housewife. They married during the Depression and now live in a house with a paid-up mortgage in a modestly middle-class section of Queens, New York. They are college-educated, literary-minded and politically liberal. I am the oldest of their three children; my sister, a graduate student in linguistics, is in the middle; Mike is the youngest. Mike and I were born in December, nine years apart almost to the day. The coincidence of birthdays is one of many similarities. If the prospect of Mike's becoming an Orthodox Jew was frightening, it was not simply because he was my brother, someone I loved. I felt an almost mystical identification with Mike. Our baby pictures were identical, and though Mike was now taller and thinner than I, we had the same fair skin, curly brown hair, and astigmatic, sleepy green eyes. We were (not that I really believed in that stuff — still — ) cliche Sagittarians: analytical, preoccupied with words and ideas. We were inclined to repress feelings; our intellectual confidence coexisted with emotional insecurity and a tendency to depression.

I was fascinated with the notion that Mike was what I might have become had I been a man, the lastborn instead of the first-, a child of the Seventies rather than the Sixties. I wondered how much the differences between us had to do with our circumstances rather than our basic natures. For there were differences, of course. Mike was much more reserved than I; he rarely talked about his feelings, his problems or his relationships. I was more worldly, more willing to compete in and compromise with a hostile system. My friendships were central to my life; he was, or seemed to be, a loner.

The qualities we shared were more pronounced in Mike, the opposing tendencies more hidden. Next to him I always felt a bit irrational and uncool. Picture a recurrent family scene: my father and I are sitting in the kitchen, having a passionate political argument. My brother is listening, not saying a word. Suddenly I put myself in his place, become self-conscious. I hear all the half-truths and rhetorical exaggerations that in the emotion of the moment I have allowed to pass my lips. I realize, with chagrin, that my father and I have had, and my brother has listened to, the same argument at least half a dozen times before. I am sure Mike thinks we are ridiculous.

I was disturbed and mystified by what I saw as my brother's swing from a skepticism more rigorous than my own to an equally extreme credulity. How could anyone familiar with the work of a certain Viennese Jew possibly believe in God the Father? What puzzled me even more was Mike's insistence that he was being reluctantly convinced by irresistible arguments. It seemed to me that his critical intelligence could only be in the way.

On acid I had, as Mike observed, experienced the something that Westerners have most commonly called "God" — the source of all truth, beauty, goodness. Unlike Mike, I had felt that I knew what it was. "So this is what it's all about," I had marveled. "It's so simple, so obvious. And I've known it all the time. I just didn't know I knew." But when I came down it was less obvious. The ecstasy — a word that didn't quite convey a feeling as natural as a spring thaw, as comfortable as coming home — gradually slipped away. "All God is," I would try to explain, "is reality — the simple, wonderful reality behind the abstract concepts and ingrained habits of perception that keep us from ever really experiencing it." And I would sound hopelessly abstract even to myself. Soon, whatever clouded the doors of perception in ordinary life began to invade my acid trips as well. I tried to fight that process — doggedly pursuing the right mood, the right situation — and only made things worse; finally, frustrated and demoralized, I stopped tripping. The entire experience had a permanent, profound effect on the way I saw myself and the world. I knew that connecting with Reality — I couldn't call it God; to me that word meant an old man with a white beard — was the crucial business of life, the key to freedom, sanity, happiness. I knew that if I could make the connection I would think: "How silly of me to have forgotten!" But I didn't know how to proceed.

This problem was not, of course, peculiar to me. It had been plaguing spiritual seekers for thousands of years. Many had tried, far more eloquently than I, to express what they agreed was inexpressible. Recognizing the inadequacy of intellectual analysis, religions tried to evoke the crucial connection through myths, rituals, rules of conduct. But in the end religion, like language, tried to express the truth in concrete form and so inevitably distorted it. If all religions were inspired by a common Reality, each reflected the particular cultural, political and psychological limitations of the people who invented and practiced it. Which posed another problem. If you understood that your religion was only an imperfect approach to the truth, you remained outside it, an observer, a critic. If, on the other hand, you truly believed — worshiped an omnipotent God, accepted Jesus as your savior, surrendered to a guru — you were confusing a set of metaphors for reality with Reality itself. And that put you back on square one. Or did it?

On my second acid trip I had had a joyous vision of the birth of Christ. In one part of my mind I had become an early Christian, experiencing the ecstasy of grace, redemption, the washing away of sin. But on a deeper level I had remained aloof, thinking, "Remember, you are a Jew." For the first time I had had a wistful inkling of what it must be like to be committed to a powerful myth. Maybe if you had faith that Jesus would save you, He would. Maybe the point was simply to stop listening to that observer/critic inside my head, to surrender my will, to have faith, and what I had faith in didn't matter any more than whether I took a train or a bus to my destination.

"Suppose you had faith in Hitler?" my observer/critic, that irrepressible crank, could not help objecting. Still, part of what had messed up my acid trips was doubt, whispering like the serpent: What if the straight world is right, and what you think is Reality is a seductive hallucination? I couldn't assent to the experience without reservation, following wherever it led; it might lead to insanity. So I tried to compromise. I wanted to tap the ecstasy whenever I wanted and be "normal" the rest of the time. It was, I suppose, the same impulse that makes sinners go to church on Sunday, with much the same result.

I was aware of the link between my skepticism and my Jewishness. It was, after all, the Jew who was the perennial doubter, the archetypal outsider, longing for redemption while dismissing the claims of would-be redeemers as so much snake oil. But what did any of this have to do with the kind of Jewishness my brother was talking about?

Mike had grown up into the economic and cultural slough of the Seventies. Though he had always been an excellent student, he had never liked school; he had found college as boring and meaningless as high school and elementary school before that. Since graduating from the University of Michigan in 1970, with a B.A. in Chinese, he had spent nearly half his time traveling. Recurrent asthma had kept him from being drafted. Between trips he would come back to New York and drive a cab to make money for the next trip. He had never had a job he liked. During his last stay in New York he had begun writing articles about Asia, and he had gone back with the idea of doing more. He had had a few pieces in newspapers, but no major breakthrough, and one major disappointment: an article he'd worked hard on was first accepted by a magazine, then sent back.

Mike was also depressed about Cambodia and Vietnam. In 1973 he had spent almost two months in Cambodia and had come away convinced that as much as the people hated the corrupt Lon Nol government, they did not want the Americans to leave and permit a Communist takeover. As Mike saw it, they wanted to be left alone to farm, while the Khmer Rouge made them take sides and shot those who chose incorrectly; they were religious Buddhists, while the Communists were antireligious and would make young men work instead of becoming monks; in short, they wanted to return to their traditional, prewar way of life, which the Communists would permanently destroy. Those premises had led Mike to what seemed an unavoidable conclusion: the Americans should not withdraw. For someone who had shared the American left's assumptions about the war, it was a disturbing reversal. If he had been wrong about Cambodia, he thought, perhaps he had been wrong about Vietnam. This past fall, a return trip to Cambodia and two weeks in Vietnam had reinforced his doubts.

When Mike arrived in Jerusalem, he had been traveling for seven months. He was going home to uncertain writing prospects, another cab job or something similar, no close friends, isolation in a political atmosphere that took for granted the assumptions he had discarded, and a general ambiance of postcounterculture aimlessness. It took no great insight to suspect that what traditional Judaism offered — absolute values to which Mike could dedicate his life; a new and exciting subject to study; a close-knit religious community; a stable, secure social structure — was considerably more attractive. Anyway, I didn't believe that people ever made profound spiritual changes for purely intellectual reasons; there had to be feelings Mike wasn't acknowledging. Not that this proved anything about the validity of Judaism. A believer could argue that Mike had been drifting because he hadn't found God, that his unhappiness was, in fact, God's way of leading him to the truth. Still, I worried that he was succumbing to an authoritarian illusion in an attempt to solve (or escape from) his problems.

In answer to my request for more details, Mike sent a seven-page, single-spaced typed letter. I chewed it over, making notes in the margin. Much of it was devoted to debunking evolution. The marvelous complexity and interdependence of everything in the universe — so the argument ran — show planning and purpose and could not have come about through the random process of natural selection. Plants and animals are perfectly constructed machines; the brain has been compared to a computer. When you see a computer, your obvious conclusion is that someone built it according to a plan. ("Rampant anthropomorphism!" I scribbled.) Every detail of creation is purposeful. For example, ready-to-eat fruits (like apples) have tempting, bright colors; vegetables that require cooking (like potatoes) are drab. ("What about toadstools?") No one has ever seen a mutation that changed one species into another. How does evolution explain something like a poisonous snake, whose survival advantage depends on a combination of traits, each useless alone? Did its poison come first, and did it then wait around millions of years for the ability to inject — or vice versa? And why did creation stop; why aren't new things constantly coming into being? ("Human chauvinism!" I wrote. "Who says creation stopped — new life forms take eons — we can't even see plants grow.")

As for the God-given nature of the Torah, when you study it in Hebrew, along with the commentaries that have been written on virtually every word, it is hard to believe that such depth and complexity could have been achieved by human beings; Judaism is such a restrictive religion that the Jews would never have accepted it if the entire people hadn't witnessed the revelation; biblical prophecies predict the Jewish exile, the return to Israel and other historical events. The prophecies were impressive, I had to admit: "Ye will be torn away from the land whither thou goest . . . and G-d will scatter you among the nations . . . thou wilt find no ease and there will be no resting place for the sole of thy foot. . . . And then G-d thy G-d will return . . . and gather thee together . . . " And so on. I began to get a headache.

Finally, my brother came to the subject I had been anticipating and dreading: women. Orthodox Judaism enshrined as divine law a male supremacist ideology I had been struggling against, in one way or another, all my life. It was a patriarchal religion that decreed separate functions for the sexes — man to learn, administer religious law and exercise public authority; woman to sanctify the home. For Mike to accept it would be (face it!) a betrayal. Already I had had the bitter thought: "You want to go back in time, find a community where mamma will still take care of you. You're just like the rest." Under the anger was fear that my sense of special connection with my brother was an illusion. If I were a man . . . if he were a woman . . . there was an unbridgeable gap in that if.

From a secular viewpoint, Mike conceded, Judaism gave men the better deal, but from a religious viewpoint it wasn't so clear. For one thing, God-fearing men, though they had the power to oppress women, would not do so. And if our purpose on earth was not to do interesting work or have a good time but to come close to God, then women had certain advantages: they had fewer commandments to perform, fewer opportunities to sin, and by having children could approach God more easily.

"Power to oppress is oppressive," I wrote in the margin. "Power corrupts the saintliest man. Exemption from responsibilities is implicit insult." Yet I realized that, after all, my objections were beside the point. This God, if He really existed, had chosen to create a hierarchy of sexes. Doubtless He had some purpose in mind, some spiritual test, perhaps a lesson in conquering pride. It might seem unfair, but it had to be for the best in the end . . . and I could never believe in such a God, never, it violated my surest sense of what Reality was about. When you connected there were no hierarchies, divisions, roles; all that was part of the husk that fell away. "I am the vanguard of the revolution!" I had shouted, high on acid, climbing up a mountain trail followed by two men who were truly my equals, our battle-of-the-sexes fright masks discarded somewhere down the road. There would be misunderstandings later, but that was another story.

No, I couldn't believe in the Jewish God. He had been invented by men seeking a rationale for their privileges. He had been invented by people seeking to reduce an ineffable Reality to terms they could understand — to a quasi-human "creator" with a "plan" and a "purpose," standing outside the universe and making it the way a carpenter made a table.

In August, my parents visited Mike in Jerusalem. He was still living and studying at Yeshivat Aish HaTorah. A yeshiva is a school where Jews study Torah; this one also functioned as a small religious community. It occupied modest quarters — a communal study room, a few classrooms, a library, an office for the rabbi — in the Jewish section of the Old City; several nearby apartments served as dormitories. Aish HaTorah (the name means "Fire of the Torah") is an English-speaking yeshiva headed by Noach Weinberg, a rabbi from New York. Most of its students — there were around 25 at the time — were young Americans; most had been tourists passing through. Mike was taking courses in Chomesh (the Five Books of Moses), the Mishna (the written codification of the Oral Law), halacha (Jewish law), Biblical Hebrew, and "48 Ways to Gain Knowledge" (talks by the rabbi on Jewish ideas about learning). His weekday schedule began at seven in the morning, with an hour of prayer before breakfast. Ordinarily, he had classes and study hours from 9 to I, then lunch and 20 minutes of afternoon prayer, classes and study from 3 to 7:30, dinner, evening prayer from 8:30 to 9, and more classes till to. He usually studied till around 11:30. During mother and dad's visit, he was taking some time off in the afternoon and evening.

My parents had both, in their individual ways, been struggling to come to terms with Mike's "conversion." My mother considered herself in some sense religious; she believed in God, even believed that the Torah might be Godgiven. But she couldn't see that God required us to observe all those regulations. Wasn't it enough to be a good person? Characteristically, she focused on practical concerns. Was Mike happy? Would religion give him what he badly needed — something satisfying to do with his life?

My father was the son of an Orthodox rabbi, but for all his adult life he had equated rationalism and religious tolerance with enlightenment. Clarence Darrow, defending Scopes and evolution against Bryan and the fundamentalist know-nothings, had been his intellectual hero. To have a child of his reject those values was a painful shock. But he had been forced by his respect for Mike's mind — and no doubt by the logic of his own belief in tolerance — to re-examine his attitudes. He went to Jerusalem prepared to listen.

The trip was reassuring. Mike seemed happier, more relaxed, more sure of himself. He was enjoying his studies. "He was different," my father told me. "There was a step up in emotional vibration. I'd never seen him so enthusiastic before." I remained skeptical; Mike's enthusiasm might be some sort of manic facade. I was still working on my reply to his long letter, debating whether to mention my qualms about his motives. From one point of view, Mike was doing something incredibly brave, even heroic: in quest of truth as he saw it he was breaking with the values and assumptions of his family, his peers, American society and the entire post-Enlightenment West. For me to bring up psychology would be to add whatever clout I had to the enormous pressure of conventional wisdom that Mike was probably having trouble enough resisting. And then there was my old religious question: even if Judaism confused its central metaphor with absolute truth, would it work for Mike if he believed? Judaism, I reminded myself, was a spiritual discipline that had been practiced for over 3000 years; psychotherapy had existed for less than a hundred, with inconclusive results.

For three years I had been seeing a Reichian therapist. I was seeking relief from specific emotional problems, but my larger spiritual problem lurked in the back of my mind. What, after all, were emotional problems but forms of — or metaphors for — disconnection? The Reichian method is based on the premise that muscular tensions hold back repressed emotions which the therapist can elicit by attacking the bodily "armor" directly, bypassing the treacherous intellect. I believed this approach worked; it had helped me a lot. Yet I could claim no miracles, only that I had come — slowly, undramatically — to feel better, see more clearly. For all I knew, my brother would get further with Judaism.

Still — suppose Mike was really being trapped, not by arguments but by his emotions? Suppose by bringing up my worries I could help him — by which I meant save him. For despite my theoretical conviction that we all had to seek the truth in our own way, I hoped, with guilty passion, that Mike would get off this particular path, would wake up one morning, ask, "What am I doing here?" and come home. I decided to say what I had to say. For me, Freud was far closer than Darwin to the heart of the matter.

II. The Mirror

In America most of the time I was unhappy and bored. I couldn't find what I wanted to do or people I wanted to be with. You were supposed to be very hip and inside I wasn't. I didn't identify with hip people or enjoy being around them. I couldn't figure out where I fit in. Traveling was my escape. I would go through a lot of rottenness and boredom for the sake of some periods of happiness — experiences that really took me out of myself, like trekking in the Himalayas.

When I came to Israel from Jordan I was very tired out and I wanted to go home. I didn't have much money left. There was a girl I really wanted to go back and see though I had no reason to believe she would want to see me. I was really homesick. But I felt a responsibility to see something new. I went with the guy from the yeshiva looking for an interesting experience. Reb Noach gave me the usual pitch: "Stay here a week, if you haven't seen a yeshiva you haven't seen Israel." We had a big political argument — I said things looked bad for Israel and the only reasonable thing to do was give back the occupied land and make peace. We had a talk about the moral imperative proof of God. Reb Noach asked where I got my concept of good. I said, "From my parents."

That week I realized Judaism was much more interesting than I'd thought. When I read Jewish philosophy I realized my mind was Jewish. I felt that for the first time I had found people who thought the way I did, who were really logical and consistent. But the idea of God was very alien to me. Then I read a pamphlet about Torah and science. I started reading the arguments about evolution. Suddenly I had a flash: "This whole theory is ridiculous!" It had a tremendous effect. I felt that my mind had been playing tricks on me. I'd been accepting this theory without really looking into it — just like Cambodia. Logically, you knock down the theory of evolution and you're stuck with — God created the world.

I left to do some traveling and went to Safed. I was sitting down looking at a map and two English guys, students of this Hasid who was up from Tel Aviv for the weekend, invited me to meet him. I went and we started talking. He had pure charisma. I related to Reb Noach as a good person, but this Hasid was someone with power. He said that people go all around the world looking into this and this and they know it's not true — then they're hit with Judaism and they leave because they're afraid it's true. It had a big effect on me because of my realization about evolution and because I'd been asking myself why I was leaving. I knew I was scared to stay and check it out.

The English guys kept telling me there were no coincidences, it wasn't an accident that I was there at the same time the Hasid happened to be visiting. I started getting scared — was all this really true? I felt lousy about myself. I had always prided myself on being open-minded. Now I had no logical reason for leaving, just an emotional desire to go home. I felt totally wiped out.

When I got back to the yeshiva I started reading Torah with the Hersch commentaries. There was a daily Chomesh [Five Books] class. I was learning some Hebrew and could feel the power of the Torah much more than in translation. And the prophecies — I kept trying to find arguments against the prophecies and couldn't come up with any.

After two or three weeks I was in doubt — what was I going to do? One day I was reading the prophecies at the end of Dvarim [Deuteronomy] and I had this cold shiver — I realized that I really believed all this. My first reaction was to compromise — I would go home, read, then decide. Or I would take a few years and travel and then come back. Finally I realized my whole life would have to change.

The first time I went to Southeast Asia I had a lot of asthma trouble. I'd almost feel like I was having a heart attack. Sometimes my pills wouldn't work and I was afraid they would just stop working. When I got into religion I realized — how can I expect a pill to work? God controls what goes on. Your life can be snuffed out at any moment. That had a strong part in keeping me here. It wasn't that I started believing in God to conquer a fear of death. Intellectually believing doesn't do that anyway. But I realized I couldn't compromise and say two years from now I'll come back, because there's no assurance of anything.

I went and canceled my plane ticket. It was painful. I was afraid my family would reject me, think I was crazy. My mind was telling me one thing. My emotions still wanted to go home.

Around Thanksgiving Mike came to New York for a month. Seeing him was a relief. His skullcap and newly grown beard made him look less boyish, but he was still wearing jeans. I felt no distance between us, no sense that he was in any way not himself. I hugged him, wondering if the Orthodox prohibition against men touching women they weren't married to applied to sisters.

Mike stayed with our parents. So that he could observe the dietary laws, mother bought him his own dishes and silverware and pots, boiled her cooking utensils and took them to a mikva (ritual bath), cleaned the oven and left it on at the hottest setting for two hours, served him kosher food, cooked him meat and dairy dishes separately in the new pots. Mike prayed three times a day, said blessings over his food and grace after meals, washed his hands on rising in the morning and before eating bread. Since the complicated Sabbath laws could only be fully observed in an Orthodox environment, he spent weekends with religious families.

He had been home several weeks when we had The Talk. We had already had a number of talks, but it was this one that sank in. We were having lunch at a kosher cafeteria on 47th Street, patronized largely by Hasidim and other ultra-Orthodox Jews in the diamond business. It was crowded with men in traditional black suits. I was insisting that it was impossible to prove the existence or the nature of God. The ultimate Reality was by definition ungraspable by reason; Mike's belief had to be based on intuition, not logic.

"It's both," Mike said. "First, you have to have an intuition that logic is real — that logic tells you something about the way the world is. Then if an idea is illogical — if it's inconsistent with what you know — you intuitively know it's wrong. Like the complexity of the world is inconsistent with the idea that it all happened at random, by natural selection."

"Not necessarily. In an infinite universe even the most unlikely combination of events can happen — "

"It's possible. But it's not probable. And when you take all the proofs together — the depth of Torah, the prophecies — maybe you can explain any one of them away, but you can't explain them all as coincidence. It just gets too improbable. Reasoning can tell you what's most probable, and when you have an overwhelming probability your intuition tells you it has to be true."

"Well, my intuition tells me the world wasn't created in six days."

Mike explained that the length of the six days of creation was open to question, since the sun wasn't created till the fourth day; that there was no problem with the idea of a biological evolution guided by God rather than natural selection, or of humanlike beings existing before Adam, so long as you accepted Adam as the first true man in the spiritual sense — made "in the image of God." I was struck by the way he argued. He sounded like me in the early days of feminism, talking to women who were unconvinced. It had been one of those rare times when I felt both sure of my ground and sure it was in the other person's interest to see things my way. That confidence had made me a good organizer; now, on the receiving end, I felt defensive.

I wasn't sure why. I did not find Mike's antievolution argument persuasive, but I was not, in any case, a dogmatic evolutionist. On acid I had had the strong impression that it was somehow in the nature of Reality to ceaselessly order itself into complex patterns; even before that I had been inclined to believe there was some unknown organizing principle in the universe. Once I had confessed to a friend, "I don't think the universe is absurd." "You don't?" she said. "No. I think it's basically logical." There was a pause. "Maybe," my friend said, "you need to see logic in it." Maybe. Either way, there was no need to assume a God with a personality, a will or a purpose.

"But it's possible," Mike said. "You have to admit it's logically possible."

"It's based on a naive analogy. A chair is made by a person, so the world has to be made by a superperson."

"You're assuming the secular view of reality — that we created God, not the other way around. The Jewish perspective is like a mirror image. It's not God who's like a human being; it's human beings who are made in God's image. Our way of making things is something like God's way. We don't get the idea of God from having parents — our relationship with our parents is meant to give us an idea of how to relate to God."

"Reality isn't a being with a personality," I said. "It's just — Reality."

"You had a mystical experience that showed you there's a spiritual reality. Judaism says that on top of this experience, which all religions share, we have a revelation that tells us what that reality is, what it wants from us."

"The idea that it wants something contradicts my experience," I insisted. "Not your experience. Just your interpretation of it."

"But I didn't interpret it. I just had it. That's what made it unique."

"Of course you interpreted it. You've grown up with a whole view of reality that says we're free, we can do what we want. So naturally you see God as something impersonal, instead of a God who says, 'You have to do what I want, not what you want.' "

I shook my head, but I felt the presence of the serpent. Had I experienced Reality, or just another deceptive metaphor?

"I don't do whatever I want," I said. "I try to do what's right."

"But you decide what's right."

"Not me, my ego. The part of me that's attuned to Reality decides. Reality defines what good is." Pretty mushy, my observer/critic remarked.

"All right. But in practice you don't really believe that you're required to live a certain way. Except for obvious things, like not killing. Judaism says God gave us a law, this is what it is, we have to obey it."

"I believe," I began, aware that I was entering a mine field of rhetoric, "I feel I know, from my — experience" — or was it just an interpretation — "that when we're in touch with Reality what's right and what we really want are the same. To love and be loved, to have a just, decent society. To figure out how to make that truth work in practice — to struggle toward it — that's what life is about. Freedom isn't doing whatever we please; it's a basic ethical value. It means taking responsibility for the struggle. Not looking to some authority to get us off the hook."

"But it doesn't work. Look at what's happening in the world; look at what Western 'enlightenment' has accomplished. Total chaos, and it's getting worse."

It was the classic conservative line. Your utopian dreams are unrealistic, against human nature. Look at the evidence. Bloody wars; repressive governments; nuclear threat; ecological destruction. And what revolution — be honest, now — what revolution has really succeeded by your standards? I was on familiar terms with this litany. Though I considered myself a radical, had been a leftist and feminist activist, I struggled perpetually with doubts (again). And if I believed, finally, in my obligation to defy a pessimism that amounted to self-fulfilling prophecy — what was that but a leap of faith?

"In a Torah community," Mike was saying, "there's no crime, the family isn't falling apart. People are serious about being good people because they're living for God, not just themselves."

"Intuitively, I can't see it," I said. "This cosmic dictator idea of God. I just don't see it."

"But you have to ask why. There are powerful emotional reasons for not seeing it. You'd have to admit that God controls your life, that you're not free. You'd have to submit to a lot of restrictions you don't like. You'd have to change. No one wants to change."

True.

"You have an incredibly complex and organized universe. Everything in it works together perfectly. The most obvious explanation is that a creator planned it that way. Everyone intuitively saw that — everyone believed in God — until evolution gave them an excuse not to. Or take the prophecies. You can explain them as a bunch of improbable coincidences, but why resist the obvious answer — that they come from God, who knows the future?"

"It was the Bible predicting the return that gave the Zionists the idea in the first place," I objected.

"But it would never have happened if it weren't for the Nazis," Mike said. "Another coincidence?"

I had no answer. The prophecies had bothered me from the start. And Mike had a point: why was it so important to me to explain them away? During my first session with my Reichian shrink he had poked my jaw muscles and asked drily, "Do you ever lose an argument?" With a shock I saw that I wasn't winning this one. Mike's premises were not only far more sophisticated than I had thought; they were the basis of a formidably comprehensive, coherent world view. All along Mike had been asking me questions I couldn't answer. How did I explain the creation of the world? How did I explain the strange history of the Jews — their unremitting persecution and unlikely survival; their conspicuous role in world affairs? How did I explain the Torah itself, with its extraordinary verbal intricacy, the meanings upon meanings the rabbis had found in phrases, words, even letters; the consistency with which their analyses hung together after the 1500 years or more that they had spent hunting down contradictions? I knew that "comprehensive and coherent" did not necessarily mean "true." "I don't know" was an honorable answer. But it did not win arguments.

I was suffering from acute mental vertigo. What a phony I was — glibly assuring Mike that his transformation had to be based on intuition rather than mere argument, while all along my confidence in my own intuition had rested on the assumption that I had the better arguments. The last thing I wanted was to be left with only fragile, fallible intuition as a shield against a system of ideas that neatly reversed everything I believed. Like a mirror image.

I understood now what Mike had meant when he said he felt trapped, understood how his skepticism could turn against itself. My own skepticism told me that however sure I was of my perceptions, I could be wrong. Therefore, since I could not prove Judaism was false, I had to admit that it could be true. And the thought of admitting any such thing threw me into a panic. Which of course was the best possible evidence for Mike's suggestion that I rejected Judaism simply because I did not care to accept it. I wanted nothing so much as to forget the whole question, and for that very reason I was bound by all my standards of intellectual honesty and courage to pursue it.

I was overwhelmed with superstitious paranoia. This was exactly how Mike had been drawn in, Mike who was so much like me. Mike was the one person in the world who could have gotten me to listen seriously to this argument. And he had stopped off in Israel mainly because of me: I had been there earlier that year, with a group of journalists, and had written him that it was interesting. From his point of view, none of this was coincidental.

During the next few days, my panic intensified. The one aspect of my life that I had never seriously doubted was my obligation to make my own choices and my own mistakes and if need be suffer the consequences. Since the only certainty was that the way to Reality was uncertain, I had no alternative. Now I saw that this certainty was as uncertain as any other. And so for the first time I faced a choice that was truly absolute, that included no tacit right to be wrong — the spiritual equivalent of a life-or-death decision in war. If the Jewish God existed and I willfully rejected Him, I would be making the ultimate, irretrievable mistake. Contrary to the common impression, Jewish theology included a system of reward and punishment that operated in both this life and the next. The eternal punishment for rejecting Torah was called karaik — "cutting off" — which meant, I assumed, what I would call total alienation from Reality. Only it was much more vivid and terrifying when you envisioned it as a punishment rather than an impersonal consequence, as losing the love, incurring the wrath of the ultimate parent.

And if I gave up my precious freedom, a renunciation that felt like death, for what I saw as an alien, joyless, shackled existence — and it turned out that the serpent had betrayed me again, that there was no God of Wrath or God of Love after all? And how could I ever know for sure? It seemed to me that whatever I did I was in trouble.

I had shed another layer of innocence. I would never again feel smug about Patty Hearst, Rennie Davis, the legions of postacid freaks who had joined mystical cults. I understood. It could happen to me. For the first time I wished I had never taken drugs, never seen beyond the scientific rationalism that might be narrow but was surely safe. I envied my father's faith in evolution. I envied everyone around me, going peacefully about their lives, taking for granted — if they thought about it at all — that Mike's brand of religion was eccentric fanaticism, nothing to do with them. I especially envied non-Jews. The 613 milzvos were reserved for the Chosen People. Others had only to obey certain basic moral laws — mostly obvious things — like not killing.

I had frustrating conversations with friends who found it hard to believe that someone so sensible and intelligent could be wondering if she ought to become an Orthodox Jew.

"Maybe it's right for him; that doesn't mean it's right for you."

"If it's true, then it has to be right for me."

"You couldn't live that way."

"That's not the point. The point is, is it true?"

"Maybe it's true for him."

"You don't understand. Judaism claims to be absolute truth. Either it's true for everybody, or it's not true at all."

"Nobody has a monopoly on the truth."

"That's the secular point of view. From the Jewish point of view there is an absolute truth, I can know it, I just don't want to accept it."

"Well, why should you accept it if you don't want to?"

"Because if it's true, then all my ideas are wrong, I'm living the wrong way, I'm totally blowing it."

"Who's to say there's only one way to live?"

"But don't you see? You say, 'We're free to decide how to live. Religious Jews say, 'No, you're not free.' So you say, 'We're free to reject that argument.' It's circular reasoning!"

"Why are you getting so upset?"

Then I talked to a woman who understood. She had grown up Catholic and lost her faith. It seemed that losing your faith and losing your lack of faith had much in common. At some point you were suspended between two competing, selfconsistent realities, knowing you had to go back or forward, with no one to help you and no net. And once you were out there, you realized that skeptic and believer were mirror images, reflecting a vision of logic in the universe.

Judaism teaches that God's rewards and punishments operate on the principle of mida k'neged mida — "measure for measure." For example, a friend of Mike's had asked to borrow 100 Israeli pounds; Mike had lent the money, but grudgingly; shortly afterward he had 100 pounds stolen from his wallet, though there was more money in it.

During my panic I had become obsessed with the thought that this principle might explain a central ironylin my own life. I had come of age at a time when sexual liberation did not yet mean groupies and massage parlors, when it was still a potent metaphor for liberation in general. At the core of my feminism was rage at the suppression of female sexuality and a romantic vision of sexual freedom as joyous, unreserved acceptance of my body, my femaleness, my partner in love. Though I hated the way this vision had been perverted, co-opted and turned against women, I believed no less in the vision itself.

The irony, of course, was the contrast between ideal and reality. Part of that reality was historical: feminism had transformed women's consciousness without, as yet, transforming society, leaving a gap between what many of us demanded of a relationship and what most men were willing to give. Yet there were ways of making the best of this situation, while I tended to make the worst of it. At 34, with a marriage and two quasi-marriages behind me, I felt, all too often, like an awkward teenager. My distrust of men fed a prickliness that provoked rejection that confirmed my distrust; worse, I was still afflicted, on some level, with the adolescent notion — no doubt the result of all those real and symbolic fights in the back seat — that to give in to sexual pleasure was to lose a power struggle. In general I thought of myself as fairly sane, but my conflicts about sex and men felt out of control — and thinking in those terms was undoubtedly part of the problem. For the sexual dilemma was the same as the spiritual one: to try harder was not only useless but self-defeating.

I had come to see my predicament as a sort of cosmic mockery, deflating my utopian pretensions. But from the Jewish standpoint, what could be a neater measure-for-measure punishment for refusing my ordained role as wife and mother? The symmetry was perfect: feminist consciousness had inspired both my sexual aspirations and the defensiveness that undermined them. It was the message one might expect from a cranky, conservative-Freudian God, out to show me that feminism was the problem rather than the solution, that all this emancipation claptrap violated my true nature and would deny me the feminine fulfillment I really craved.

Another mirror image, more powerful than the rest, it exposed my most private pain, doubt and vulnerability. I knew then that I had to go to Israel and confront my terror at its source — to put myself in my brother's place and see if I reached the same conclusions. I also knew that I had to write about the process. I was not sure these imperatives were compatible. When I decided not only to write about my trip but to write about it on assignment — which meant committing myself to come home and deliver a manuscript — I felt a bit like Ulysses tying himself to the mast. The difference, of course, was that I could cut myself loose if I chose. And in its perverse way, my very need to hedge was evidence of my good faith. At least it would have to do.

III. First Encounters

I left New York on March 22nd, 1976, on an overnight flight packed with Jewish tour groups. Here and there I saw religious men in beards and yarmulkes (skullcaps). At dawn they began getting up to form a minyan (ten-man quorum) for morning prayer. The Israeli flight attendants gave them dirty looks for blocking the aisles.

We arrived around noon. I wandered outside, past clumps of armed teenage soldiers, looking for Mike. I was beginning to wonder if we had missed each other when a tall, thin boy wearing a yarmulke approached me.

"Are you Ellen?"

Chaim was a student at my brother's yeshiva; he had come to meet me because Mike had a bad cold. He explained that we would stop first at Rabbi and Rebbetsen Weinberg's, where I would leave my bags, then go find Mike. We took a cab into Jerusalem, talking sketchily about the experiences that had brought each of us here, and caught the bus for Kiryat Zanz, a religious neighborhood nestled in a rocky hillside. In contrast to the gorgeous landscape, the rows of identical low apartment buildings were dreary, housing-project modern. Block 5 Building 2 housed the Weinbergs and their nine children.

The rebbetsen invited us into an apartment that conveyed a sense of busy warmth. It was crammed with books and artifacts — menorahs, vases of flowers, bright fabrics, pictures of wise men, a colored-glass chandelier.

Denah Weinberg is a striking woman. Slim, fair, blue-eyed, in her late 305, she looks like a picture-postcard of the ideal Jewish matriarch — one part strength and competence, one part motherliness, one part a modest, almost austere beauty accentuated by the kerchief that covers her head. (When an Orthodox woman marries, her hair becomes private, seen only by her husband.) I immediately craved her approval without quite knowing why. We sat in the kitchen chatting about my brother while children wandered in and out. I mentioned that I wanted to find out more about women's role in Judaism.

"Good!" the rebbetsen said. "People misunderstand it." "Suppose I don't want children," I began, "or anyway no more than one or two . . . ."

Mrs. Weinberg's reply threw me. "If someone gave you money, would you turn it down?"

"I don't get the comparison." Money buys freedom; children take it away: the instant I had the thought it seemed unbearably crass.

"Children are a blessing," said the rebbetsen firmly. The conversation had taken a depressing turn. I could no more imagine having nine children than contemplate climbing Mt. Everest.

"I don't want to devote all my time to children," I said. "I want to write."

"You can do both. A Jewish woman shouldn't spend all her time with her children. We can do much more."

"If I had a bunch of kids I wouldn't have any time and energy to spare."

"The Almighty wants us to use our talents. He wouldn't punish you by not letting you write. You'd find the time."

Well, maybe so. I wasted so much time, after all. No doubt a disciplined person could raise half a dozen kids in the time I spent daydreaming, reading junk, sleeping late. But I would never be that person; I knew my limitations. Or was that just an excuse for laziness?

The rebbetsen kissed me goodbye, and Chaim and I took a bus to the walled Old City. The Jewish Quarter, which had been largely destroyed by the Jordanians in 1948, was still being rebuilt; the smell of dust and the sound of drilling were pervasive. Mike emerged from his dorm looking pale and tired from his cold. We walked over to Yeshivat Aish Ha-Torah, which was on a side street called Misgav Ledach, tucked beside a huge construction site. To the northeast the yeshiva overlooked some of the most spectacular sights in Jerusalem — the Mount of Olives, the Valley of Kidron and the golden Dome of the Rock. It was a short walk from the Western Wall ("Wailing Wall"), the sacred remnant of King Solomon's Temple.

We found the rabbi in his office. Like his wife, Noach Weinberg has a compelling presence. He is in his mid-40s, but with his white beard, black suit and air of authority he seems older. He regarded me with a friendly smile and eyes that suggested he had my number but liked me anyway. I thought he looked like God the Father in His more jovial aspect. After we had been introduced he told Mike that a kid who had been staying at the yeshiva was about to leave.

"You know why they leave?" he said to me. "They leave because they're scared they'll like it." He shook his head. "Insanity! Do you know how Jews define sin? Sin is temporary insanity."

For instance, he explained, he had a bad habit of wasting time; who in his right mind would want to waste time?

"What about more serious sins?" I said.

Reb Noach raised his eyebrows. "Wasting time," he said, "is very serious. It's a kind of suicide."

* * *

For the first few days I stayed with one of Mike's teachers, Shimon Haskel, and his wife Chaya. I began to unwind from my trip and settle in. I was feeling close to Mike, and we talked more openly than ever before about our family, our childhoods, our fears and hangups. Mike told me that I seemed so confident he had always been afraid of me; I told him that I'd felt he was Mr. Cool, secretly putting me down. "But now," said Mike, "I'm not afraid of you anymore." I was pleased with the change in him. He was not only more confident but more willing to face his emotional problems — the split between intellect and feeling, the distance from other people, the lack of joy. He was obliged to face them, for they were also religious problems. It was a commandment to be happy; unhappiness in effect denied God's love, dismissed His gifts.

Mike was also absorbed in his work. He found the yeshiva completely different from all the schools he had hated. Both teachers and students were deeply involved in learning; they had no doubt that what they were doing was important. Universities, Mike felt, were dead; Aish HaTorah was alive. For several hours every morning he studied Gemara (the voluminous rabbinical commentaries on the Mishna; Mishna and Gemara together constitute the Talmud). In the afternoon and evening he studied Rambam (Maimonides). Somehow he found the time to talk with new people, listening to their problems, answering questions, and out of this had come another project: he was writing a group of papers arguing various proofs of God's existence and the Torah's divinity. His persuasiveness and intellectual skills had made him something of a star at the yeshiva.

Aish HaTorah is a yeshiva for ba'al tshuvas — delinquent Jews who have "returned." It is the fourth such yeshiva that Noach Weinberg has started in the past decade. Recently, others have picked up on Reb Noach's vision and started their own yeshivas in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

In America, the most conspicuous Jewish evangelizers of Jews have been Hasidim. Hasidism, a tendency within Judaism that stresses joy, prayer and mystical experience, began in the 18th century as a revolt by poor and uneducated Jews against the elitist intellectualism of the yeshivas of Eastern Europe, particularly Lithuania. The ba'al tshuva yeshiva movement in Israel comes from the latter tradition, that of the misnagdim — rationalist opponents of Hasidism — who emphasize learning Torah as the highest value and chief means of approaching God. A yeshiva like Aish HaTorah operates on the premise that the best weapon against unbelief is rational argument. It follows that the crucial first step is to get people to listen. Boys are urged to come for a day, an hour, a meal, a bed. (No one has to pay unless he can afford to; the school is supported mostly by contributions.) A beginner's program runs for three months and then repeats; a student can start at any point. Those who stay can advance as fast as their ability allows to study of the Talmud and biblical commentaries.

There was a major hitch in my plan to replicate Mike's experience: I could not go to Aish HaTorah. Orthodox education is sexually segregated, and opportunities for women are limited. Learning is a religious obligation only for men; among tradition-minded Jews the issue of whether women should study Torah and Talmud, and if so how much, is controversial. None of the women's schools in Jerusalem offers a comprehensive intellectual and religious experience like Aish HaTorah's. Nor do they cater to transients. Still, I decided to check out a couple of schools and visit a student Mike knew.

Lorie Bernstein was 19 and the product of a rich Long Island suburb; her divorced parents owned clothing stores. Mike had first met her at the airport on his way back from New York. During the cab ride into Jerusalem she had told him that she had been a Hasid for a while but had reverted to existentialism; Mike had urged her to give Judaism another try. Since then she had become a fervent ba'al tshuva. When I introduced myself she hugged me excitedly. She was small and bouncy, with dark hair tucked in a bun; she wore a longsleeved blouse, a long skirt and gold-rimmed, blue-tinted glasses.

I had found Lorie just as she was about to do some errands in Mea Shearim, an old, poor, fanatically pious community noted for its anti-Zionists (they believe there cannot be a legitimate Jewish state until the coming of the Messiah), its Hasids in medieval caftans, and its signs demanding that female tourists conform to Torah standards of modest dress. We walked there together. Lorie stopped several times to give coins to beggars, all the while keeping up a passionate monologue.

"God gives us so much, you just have to do something back. I love doing mitzvos and helping people. A few agorot mean nothing to you, but you're giving someone food, making him happy. This religion is so beautiful!" She was bubbly, breathless; energy rolled off her in waves. "Whether there's a God or not, the Torah helps you live up to your potential. It's like tripping — you get an awareness of everything you do. I really have to think about food now — what's milk, what's meat, my mother-love side and beast side? Every day I have to thank God for all kinds of things. Thank God I'm awake. (Think of all the people who aren't awake.) Thank God for commanding me to wash. Whenever I wash I'm aware of my hands and how wonderful they are. Thank God for clothing the naked. How many people think every day about how they have clothes and other people don't? There's even a prayer for the bathroom — thank God for my ducts and orifices, that they're working properly."

I asked her how she felt about Judaism's view of women.

"I'm dying to get married and have children. Right now I'm doing tshuva, repentance, for having an abortion. I killed a baby! I'm so upset! What could possibly be more important than having children?"

I mumbled something about wanting to write.

"Writing!" Lorie said scornfully. "I used to write, I used it to get rid of energy. What's writing compared to creating a human being, a soul?"

"It happens to be what I want to do."

"What you want! I used to be that way. The most important thing was to be authentic — to do what I really wanted to do, even if it hurt someone. My ideal was Meursault in The Stranger. Life was meaningless so why pretend it wasn't? Anyway," she said, "most things you think you want to do you don't really want to do. Other people want you to do them. The only thing I really miss is getting high. I love getting high — I love it! If there was one thing that could get me off religion it would be that."

On the other side of the street — we were now in Mea Shearim — two touristy looking girls passed by, transgressing the modesty laws by wearing jeans. "If I weren't with you," Lorie said, "I'd go over and yell at them."

"I don't think it does much good to yell at people," I said, feeling resentful about the antiwriting remarks.

"You can't tell," said Lorie. "Sometimes one little thing can change you around. What got me to join the Hasidim was that someone told me how low their divorce rate was. If I just explained about modesty — why it's not good to wear pants — " She stopped. "I'm being too heavy, aren't I? I'm sorry. I get carried away when I meet a new person."

We walked past stalls selling fruits and vegetables, down a narrow, cobbled back street, to visit a friend of Lorie's who might help place some students with families for Shabbos. Leah, a vivacious, middle-aged Hasidic housewife, insisted on serving us vegetable soup, bread and cream cheese. She supervised the washing ritual, showing me how to pour from the two-handled cup, how to cup my hands, making me do it over until I got it exactly right, while Lorie bounced up and down, protesting, "Leah! You'll discourage her! You've got to start out easy!"

I began hanging around Lorie's school, sitting in on classes — which mostly centered on Hebrew texts and made me feel as if I'd stumbled into the middle of a foreign-language movie with inadequate subtitles — and talking with Lorie and her friends. There was Frieda from Brooklyn, strong, blunt, a scrapper, a woman with a vision: she intended to start a ba'al tshuva organization in the States. There was Cindy, a blind girl from New Jersey, who had identified with black people so intensely that she still spoke with a trace of a pseudo-Southern accent, who had decided to convert to Christianity and had joined a black church, but then — boruch Hashem! — praise God! — had realized where she belonged. There was Sarah, who had been born Protestant in Chicago and had converted after investigating every philosophy there was and deciding that only Judaism made sense.

But at the psychological center of my life in Jerusalem were the rabbi and the rebbetsen. Noach Weinberg, the youngest son of a Hasid, grew up on New York's Lower East Side; Denah came from Long Island. They met and married in the late Fifties, and emigrated to Israel in 1961. Reb Noach was determined to do something to reverse the Jewish drift away from Torah. For six years he studied with his goal in mind and in 1967 he started his first yeshiva. Aish HaTorah has been going since 1973. Reb Noach runs the school, teaches, and makes periodic fundraising trips to the States. The rebbetsen mothers their children, runs their household, studies, teaches, does charity work and acts as counselor and friend to the yeshiva students and other young people who seek her out. During Aish HaTorah's first year she was also its chief administrator.

On Monday nights a group of women met at Rebbetsen Weinberg's for her class on the 613 mitzvos. The rebbetsen was currently discussing the mitzva to do good. Doing good, in Jewish terms, involves a constant struggle between the two sides of our nature: the yeitzer tov (good inclination), which arises from the soul and desires to serve God, and the yeitzer hara (evil inclination), which stems from the body and craves unlimited material, sexual and egotistical satisfactions.

"What's the difference between a war against people and the war against the yeitzer hara?" the rebbetsen asked. "A people war has an end; there's no end to the yeitzer hara war. A people war doesn't go on 24 hours a day. In a people war, you win something limited. If you win the yeitzer hara war, you have everything. And if you lose — "

It was an incongruous image for a Jewish mother of nine, but I couldn't help thinking of Joan of Arc.

"You have to develop a strategy. For instance, suppose you know that when you meet a certain person you're going to talk loshon hora."

Loshon hora, slander, is an important sin, the subject of a formidable body of law. It is forbidden to say anything disparaging about someone — whether or not it is true — or to say anything that could be construed as disparaging, or to listen to such talk. It is even forbidden to praise someone in front of an enemy who might be tempted to argue. The Haskels had a sign in their kitchen that said, "Is that loshon hora?"

"You should try to avoid the person," said the rebbetsen. "But if you can't, then you should think, how can I avoid the bad conversation? Is there some other way I can make her feel good?"

"Why not take the direct approach," one of the women asked, "and just say, 'Let's not talk loshon hora?' "

"Not everyone can take that," said the rebbetsen. "You might just put her on the defensive."

To be good, Mrs. Weinberg summed up, was to emulate the Almighty, to become as perfect an image of Him as possible. To be infinitely patient, to return insult with kindness — and without self-congratulation. How to do this? "Know the 613 mitzvos. There is no other way."

It occurred to me that if Talmudic logic had made Mike realize how Jewish his thinking was, Jewish ethics made me realize how Jewish my feelings were. I was beginning to understand Jewish guilt. Unlike Christian guilt, which assumed one's inherent depravity, it came from the idea that one could and should attain perfection. Jews who took their religion seriously had no need to feel guilty. They knew the 613 mitzvos were the way, and if they backslid they could catch themselves and carry on. For Jews like me it was different; secular enlightenment was the brew that provoketh the desire but taketh away the performance. We still craved perfection, and so we pursued utopian politics, utopian sex, utopian innocence. But we had no law to guide or reassure us. With the law, one could have patience with one's shortcomings. Without it, if we were not there we were nowhere at all. "To live outside the law you must be honest" — Bob Dylan, a Jew, said that.

Since the Haskels had three little children and another guest in their crowded apartment,I moved in with Chaya's stepsister, Abby Ginsberg, and her roommate, Sharon Weitz. They shared a large apartment — inherited from Abby's parents, who had gone back to the States — on Shimoni Street in Rasco, an attractive residential neighborhood that was not predominantly religious. Like the Haskels they were from the Midwest. Abby was studying at Hebrew University, Sharon at a seminary. Both women were more religious than their families. I felt immediately comfortable with Sharon and Abby, in part because their sense of female identity did not seem radically different from my own. They had not grown up isolated from secular life. They had gone to public high school, dated, worn pants; they had not married at 18; they were serious about learning; the man Abby was seeing pitched in with the cooking and played blues on his guitar. Unlike Lorie, they were not reacting against their past; because their religious commitment had deepened gradually rather than come through sudden conversion, they had none of the ba'al tshuva's dogmatic intensity.

"Of course I feel a conflict between Judaism and feminism," Sharon said. "It's harder to accept if you've been exposed to Western ideas than if you grew up in Mea Shearim. But if you're committed to Judaism, other principles have to adjust. To me a Jewish life offers so many satisfactions — " She smiled and shrugged. Intellectually she knew where she stood, but emotionally she was still struggling. "The thing I really care about," said Abby, "is being able to learn. If I thought the halacha wouldn't allow me to learn — then I might have a problem."

Abby was ebullient; Sharon had a quieter warmth. They were ten years younger than I, but I often felt as if our ages were reversed. They projected a balance, an un-self-conscious maturity symbolized for me by the way they cooperated in maintaining their cheerful apartment. The Shimoni Street place was just an ordinary middle-class apartment, conventionally furnished by the absent parents, serving as a way station for two young, transient students. But Abby and Sharon made it feel like home. They were, for one thing, enthusiastic cooks. Almost every afternoon I would come back to find them in the kitchen discussing recipes; since Abby was experimenting with vegetarianism they were always trying new concoctions — cheese-and-spinach souffles, vegetable pies, fruit salads.

Often Abby's friend Joshua would be there too. He was leaving for the States in a few weeks, right after Passover; in the meantime he and Abby were trying to figure out how they felt about each other. Orthodox Jews do not play sexual games: a man and a woman are either compatible or they aren't, and if they decide they are they get married. So Josh was at Shimoni Street several nights a week. He and Abby would study and argue points of halacha, and then we would all help with the dinner and eat together, talking and joking about the events of the day, what this or that teacher said, my latest argument with Lorie. I would go to bed and read, or write in my notebook, and when I padded to the kitchen or the bathroom at 2 or 3 a.m. I would, as often as not, hear the pacific murmur of one of Josh and Abby's marathon conversations.

IV. Truth and Consequences

The first commandment," said Reb Noach, "is to know there is a God." We were resuming a conversation we had started a few days earlier. "The disease of Western thought," he had said then, "is: 'There is no absolute truth.' But it's intuitively obvious that either something is true or it isn't. Listen — 'There is no absolute truth.' 'Are you sure?' 'Yes.' 'Are you absolutely sure?' "I could afford to laugh. I believed something was true or it wasn't; I just didn't think we could know for sure which was which. "They call us fanatics. But a fanatic is someone who won't listen to reason. I say, let's reason together. Let's find a premise on which we can both agree, and reason from there. The purpose of reason," he had concluded, "is to get someone to the point where his intuition will say, 'Yes, you're right.' "

"Know there is a God," Reb Noach repeated. "Not 'have faith.' Understand! Reason! But reason can only tell you what you already know. It's a servant, like your hand." He held his hand out. "Hand! Come to my nose!" The hand did not move. "What's this? Revolution? Don't be silly! No, your hand acts on what you really want, not on what you say you want. Reason will tell you what you really know — what are your perceptions, not other people's, not society's."

For the next hour or so, Reb Noach tried to persuade my intuition. If my father on his deathbed asked me to say a mourner's prayer for him, would I? Of course. If he asked me to say a bunch of nonsense syllables, would I? Probably not. Why not? What's the difference? Well, I think religious ritual is meaningful, worthy of respect; that doesn't mean it represents absolute truth. If someone ran in front of my car and I hit him, wouldn't I feel guilty, even if I couldn't possibly have stopped in time? Yes, I would. What did that tell me? "Even if it's not technically my fault, someone has suffered because of me. It's irrational, but I'd think, 'If I'd just done something different — taken the bus, stayed home . . . .'"

"The reason you would feel guilty," Reb Noach said, "is that it really would be your fault. If you hadn't done something wrong, God wouldn't have chosen you as the instrument of someone's death."

I appreciated Reb Noach's technique. I realized that I had, on occasion, used it myself. (Don't you and your husband both work? Suppose you lived with your sister, and you both worked, and she wanted you to cook dinner every night because she was tired — would you do it? Why not? Well, then, what's different about doing it for a man?) But my intuition was unconvinced. I still couldn't see the ultimate Reality as a being who cared, willed, intervened in our lives and — might as well bring it up — decreed separate functions for men and women.

"You don't think men and women are basically different?"

"Basically, no," I said. "Basically, I think we're all human beings."

"One of the craziest ideas in this crazy modern world," said Reb Noach, "is that men and women are the same. Men and women are two different species!"

I insisted that whatever the differences — and who could tell at this point which were inherent, which imposed by a patriarchal culture? — they did not require women to devote themselves to as many babies as chose to make their appearance. Reb Noach shook his head.

"Children are the greatest pleasure," he said, "but people today are so decadent they prefer their material comforts to children."

"It's not just material comfort!" I protested. "People have a right to some freedom — some time for themselves — "

"Decadence, Ellen. I'd have 50 children, a hundred. Every child is a lesson in love!"

"My parents aren't decadent! They've worked hard to bring up three children — to educate us all — "

Suddenly I found myself weeping.

"Ellen!" The rabbi's voice vibrated through me, alarmed, caring, soothing as a touch. "I'm not condemning people! Who knows who's better than who? I'm talking about actions. Mistakes, Ellen."

I wasn't sure why I was crying — except that if my middle-class family-centered parents could by any standard be accused of decadent behavior, then I was completely hopeless. My loss of control took me by surprise. I suppose it was my first overt symptom of culture shock.

How long was it since I'd landed at the airport — eight days? nine? It felt much longer. My sense of time had changed, along with my perspective. I was, in crucial ways, an outsider — a reporter, at that — in a strange culture. Yet because I was Jewish, I was also family. Whatever anyone might think of me, whether I was religious or not, so long as I was living in the Orthodox community I was on some basic level accepted as part of it. And so I began, almost imperceptibly at first, to identify with that community and feel weirdly estranged from the secular world. I found myself thinking of nonreligious people as "they." When I had an errand in downtown Jerusalem I felt assaulted by its frenetic, noisy, garish urbanness, by the crowds of Israelis who milled along Jaffa Road without a care for the subtleties of Jewish law.

Even the ever-present political tension began to seem part of that other world. A deep belief that God controls events tends to cool political fervor, and only a minority of Orthodox Israelis fit the stereotype of the militant religious nationalist; Mike and his friends were critical of the rabbinical establishment for what they saw as its readiness to bend the Torah to the demands of the state. I had arrived in Israel at a volatile time: Palestinian students had been demonstrating in the Old City; Israeli Arabs were protesting the expropriation of Arab land in the Galilee. I read about it all in the Jerusalem Post, feeling, absurdly, that Israeli politics had been much more vivid to me when I was in New York.

A religious universe enveloped me. I was surrounded by people who believed and, more important, lived that belief every minute. Conversation among Orthodox Jews never strays far from questions of ethics, points of law, one's religious activities; even small talk is inescapably religious: "I'm feeling better, boruch Hashem!; "I ran into so-and-so on Shabbos"; "She's going to have a milchig [dairy] wedding." Orthodox life has its own special rhythm. There is the daily rhythm of prayer and the weekly rhythm of preparations for Shabbos: rushing to clean and cook before Friday sundown, when all work must be suspended; setting lights to go on and off automatically; taking turns showering, hoping the hot water won't run out; dressing up; lighting the Sabbath candles. There is Shabbos itself: making kiddush (blessing and sharing wine); washing and breaking bread and sitting down to the traditional European-Jewish Friday night chicken dinner; the men going off to shul Saturday morning, coming home to a meal of cholent, a stew that is made before Shabbos and left simmering on the stove; studying, walking, visiting or napping in the afternoon; the light supper and finally the havdalah ("division") ceremony with which Shabbos ends.

Although the process was less dramatic, my immersion in Jewish life was having a far more potent effect on me than my confrontation with Jewish ideas. I could argue with ideas, but I could not, without being an abrasive nuisance, refuse to adapt, in important respects, to the customs of my hosts. On the most superficial level this meant not washing Abby and Sharon's dairy dishes in the meat sink, but it also meant shifting mental gears to participate in conversations that took a religious outlook for granted. Living with Orthodox Jews was like being straight at a party where everyone else is stoned; after a while, out of sheer social necessity, you find yourself getting a contact high.

There was, for instance, the afternoon I spent talking with Lorie and Frieda. Frieda had recruited Lorie for her ba'al ishuva organization; they were planning to go back to New York in July to get the project moving. I started giving advice. If they wanted young, educated women to take Judaism seriously, I argued, their organization would have to engage women's minds the way Aish Ha Torah had engaged Mike's. That meant . . . and then I heard myself: I was telling them how to seduce me.

I had always thought of Orthodox Judaism as a refuge for compulsives: not only did its ubiquitous requirements and prohibitions seem to preclude spontaneity, but since the halacha, like any body of law that applies basic principles to specific situations, was open to interpretation, it provided endless opportunities for what outsiders would call hairsplitting. For example, it's Shabbos and Sharon and Abby have a problem: they have, as usual, left a kettle of boiling water on a burner they lit Friday afternoon, and now the flame has gone out. Is it permitted to switch the kettle to another lit burner? If the water has cooled off, heating it up again would violate the rule against cooking on Shabbos. If it's still hot, moving it should be okay. But it must have cooled off slightly. How hot does it have to be? Under the kettle, covering both burners, is a metal sheet, there as a reminder not to turn the flames up or down; does this make both flames one fire, which would mean that switching the kettle is allowed in any case? Abby, Sharon and Josh debated this issue for half an hour; it remained unresolved, and they did not move the kettle.

I understood now that to call this sort of behavior compulsive was to assume that religious observance was a distraction from life, while for believers it was the whole point; secular concerns were the distraction. If doing mitzvos — all of them, not just those you understood or liked — was the way to serve God, to connect with Reality, then it was crucial to do them exactly right. For the people around me, Torah was not a straitjacket but a discipline, shaping and focusing their energies toward the only meaningful end. It was an arduous discipline, but one that was no more inherently compulsive than my own search for the precise adjective, or the care with which feminists analyzed the minutiae of sexual relationships.

And what was so sacred, anyway, about the arcane customs of my hyperurban, freelance existence? For all that I was so attached to it, I had to admit that it was, in the context of human history, more than a little strange. Sociologists liked to talk about how rootless and mobile Americans were, but most Americans at least had families. Despite my reluctance to assume the burdens of motherhood in a sexist society, it disturbed me to think that I would very likely never have children: I felt that child rearing, like working and loving, was one of the activities that defined humanness. Even my work — my excuse for so much of what I did or didn't do — sometimes struck me as ridiculous. What was the point of sitting home scratching symbols on paper, adding my babblings to a world already overloaded with information? And what of my belief in the supreme importance of connecting with Reality? Orthodox Jews acted on their version of that belief; did I? Well, there was my therapy. It occupied all of 45 minutes of my week — less time than it took me (speaking of compulsive rituals) to read the Sunday Times. Did I really have my priorities straight?

If my traumatic talk with Mike had shocked me into realizing that Judaism was a plausible intellectual system, living in Jerusalem was making me realize that Judaism was a plausible way of life. And that realization slid relentlessly into the next: that it was plausible even for me. My rapport with Abby and Sharon weakened my defenses against this frightening idea. I experienced Shimoni Street as a kind of halfway house. Much as I admired the rebbetsen, she was too unlike me to be a model. Lorie, in an entirely different way, was also from another world. But Abby and Sharon had the psychology of modern intellectual women. If they found Orthodox life exciting and full of purpose — if they had been exposed to the freedoms I had, yet did not feel deprived — perhaps I did not need those freedoms as much as I thought.

Yet even as I was drawn into the Orthodox subculture, I also resisted it. My resistance took an embarrassing form; it surfaced as a spoiled brat yelling, "I won't!" If I had come to Israel to experience Judaism, it made sense for me to try to observe Jewish law. I had resolved, for instance, to eat only kosher food during my stay. For a month this would scarcely be a major deprivation; I had stuck to reducing diets that required much more discipline. Yet I found that I couldn't keep away from the junk-food stands on Jaffa Road; I stuffed myself with suspect brands of chocolate; under my modest dresses I was puffing out at a disquieting rate. Then there was the synagogue issue. Though communal prayer was not required of women, I felt that I should, at least once, attend services at an Orthodox shul. But I was afraid to face what I saw as the total humiliation of sitting upstairs in the women's section. Some journalist, I mocked myself. Lucky no one ever sent you to cover a war.

I began to realize that I was depressed. The weather, still wintry and raw, depressed me. The city itself depressed me, which was a surprise. On my first trip to Israel I had reacted very differently. I was not thinking about religion then; I was preoccupied with politics, war, history, the tragic clash of nationalisms. But I had been awed by the radiance of Truth and Consequences everyone is stoned: after a while you get a contact high. Jerusalem. Perhaps it was just the combination of natural beauty and antiquity, but whatever holiness was, the city breathed it. Standing before the massive stones of the Western Wall, submerged in a crowd of people praying, I had felt the pain and ecstasy of millions of pilgrims course through me. 
A friend had arranged for several members of our group to have Friday night dinner with a religious family, and all evening I felt the way I had at the Wall. Everything had a preternatural clarity and significance. When our host said the blessings over the bread and wine, I marveled that I had been so obtuse as not to see. Blessing one's food — appreciating the miracle of food — what could be more fitting? And the whole idea of the Sabbath, one day a week when you were forbidden ordinary distractions and had to be alone with yourself and Reality . . . . I imagined myself back in New York City, spending a Saturday without writing, eating in a restaurant, taking the subway; a whole day with the phone off the hook and the record player silent. A fantasy, of course, I could never live that way, didn't even want to, and yet I felt a pang: isn't this what it's all about, the acid peace, the connection you say you want, getting rid of all the noise?

Now, though I remembered those feelings, I couldn't recreate them. I went to the Wall, saw weathered stone spattered with pigeon droppings, left quickly because of the cold wind. And Shabbos, with all its restrictions, was simply oppressive, like a tight girdle. "Last time," said Mike, "you could be open to it because you weren't seriously thinking about it as a possibility."

It was during Shabbos, the second since I'd arrived, that my depression hit full force. A friend of Mike's had invited us for the weekend. He and his wife were warmly hospitable, and I struggled guiltily against my gloom. I felt suffocated by domesticity, by the children calling for mommy, the men leaving for shul and the women staying home, the men sitting at the table and the women carting away the dishes. I wanted to tear off my itchy, constricting stockings. I wanted to write in my notebook, turn on lights, eat without going through half an hour of ritual first.

The next day I went to El Al to confirm my return reservation. The flight I was booked on left April 22nd, but my excursion ticket was good for two extra weeks if I wanted them, and I figured it was time to decide. I was always superstitious about switching flights; now, looking over the timetable, I felt irrationally certain that if I changed my plans I would end up staying in Israel. Something would trap me here. When Lorie first came to Jerusalem she had dreamed she was in prison, supervised by a mean lady; she had wanted to get out, but by the time they were ready to let her go, a month later, she loved it and wanted to stay. On the strength of that dream Lorie had decided to stay a month and, sure enough, she was still here . . . . This is ridiculous, I lectured myself. If you want to go you'll go; if you want to stay you'll stay; and if God is really controlling your life it's useless to second-guess Him. I debated staying at least a few extra days, but that would mean going through another Shabbos. I decided to stick with my original flight.

As soon as I left the office, a new wave of paranoia hit: God would punish me for my rotten attitude toward Shabbos. My plane would crash or be attacked by terrorists. Mida k'neged mida — measure for measure. Later that day, I realized I couldn't leave on April 22nd: it was the last day of Passover, and I had been invited to Reb Noach's. The prospect of having to change my reservation after all solidified my conviction that I would never make it back to the States. I had received a sign. There were no coincidences.

When I told Mike about my scheduling mix-up, he looked as if I'd punched him in the jaw. "You're leaving early," he said. "I thought you had six weeks."

"I planned on staying a month. I'm just doing what I was going to do all along."

"It's not just that. You want to leave because you're depressed. You're reacting exactly the same way I did."

My gut contracted.

"Mike, I'm not you. We may be alike in a lot of ways, but we're two different people." Under the panic I had to remember that, hold on to that. "If I want to go home, I'm going home, and I'm not going to feel guilty about it."

"But you can't postpone these questions — " He shook his head. "When you first came, you were really relating to what was going on. Now I feel as if you've withdrawn."

Do you really have to go back?" the rebbetsen asked. I had come over for another talk with Reb Noach. "Theoretically," I said, "I could throw over my entire life and stay. But I don't want to."

"Do you think it's important to find out if there's a God?"

"Well — " Leave me alone! Get off my back!

"If there is, and we don't find out, are we culpable?"

I don't have to listen to this! It's brainwashing, that's what it is!

"I can find out in New York," I said. "If I offered you a $200,000 business deal," Reb Noach put in, "you wouldn't say, 'I can make the same deal in America.' You'd say, 'Let's talk.'"

"I have a whole life to get back to," I insisted. "I like my life."

"Then you won't really try to find out," said the rebbetsen.

"I didn't say that."

"Well, will you?"

"I don't know," I said, feeling miserable.

I was not in the best mood to face Reb Noach. During our talks, he had been going through the proofs of God one by one. His theme this time was: "A design must have a designer." I had by now had this argument with several people. I still didn't buy it. Finally, Reb Noach said, "Ellen, think for a minute: is there a reason you don't want to believe the proofs?"

"Well, I can't deny that," I said. "I don't want to change my whole world view. But — "

"Look at it objectively! If you accept one proof it doesn't mean changing your whole world view."

"But I don't accept it. I don't see that the order in the universe has to be created by a personal God."

"There seems to be a wall here," said Reb Noach. "I don't want to pursue this unless you want to."

He started on another tack. "Why was the world created? For our pleasure. What is the one thing we are capable of doing? Seeking pleasure. So how can we go wrong? Insanity! Tell me — what's the opposite of pleasure?"

"Pain," I said.

"No! No! The opposite of pleasure is comfort. Pleasure involves pain. Decadence is opting for comfort. For example, what's more important, wisdom or money? Ask most people, they'll say 'wisdom.' 'Okay, stay here six months and I'll give you wisdom.' 'I can't — I have a job, a girlfriend, I'm supposed to take a vacation in the Greek islands.' 'Stay six months and I'll give you $20,000.' 'Fine!' 'What about your job, your girlfriend?' 'They'll wait.'

"The soul wants wisdom; the body wants money. The soul wants pleasure; the body wants comfort. And what's the highest pleasure? The aim of the soul? God, Ellen. That's real happiness — ecstasy, Ellen! Find out what you're living for! Take the pain — pleasure only comes with a lot of pain. I'm your friend — I'm with you. Give up your life of striving for success, for identity, your name up there — "

Unfair! "Do you really think I write just to get my name in print?"

"I think you do it to have an identity. To be 'a writer.'"

"I do like having that. But would you believe that I write mainly because I enjoy it, and I'm good at it, and" — defiantly — "I think it's useful work!"

"Shakespeare's okay," said Reb Noach, "but unless you know the real meaning of life, you're a zombie, a walking dead man. Find out what you're living for, Ellen. Clarity or death!"

There began to be moments — usually early in the morning, before I forced myself to get up and face the day — when I was more inclined than not to believe that it was all true, that I was only resisting because I couldn't stand the pain of admitting how wrong I was. What about the prophecies . . . . and the way modern history seemed almost a conspiracy to drive the Jews back to Israel . . . and the Bible . . . Mike and I had been going over Genesis, along with the Rashi commentary, and I had had a sudden vision, like an acid flash, of a Garden, and a Presence . . . and my personality, my Sagittarian compulsion to aim straight at the cosmic bull's-eye . . . "The blessing and curse of being a Jew," said Reb Noach, "is that Jews are thirsty for God, for the absolute. A Jew can never have peace. Whatever he does he'll be the best at, whether it's being a radical or being a criminal. It's all misplaced searching for God. Every Jew is a neurotic . . . ."

And if I became religious, what would I do? Insanity, decadence, call it what you please, I could never be a traditional Jewish mother. But may be I didn't have to be. Actually, only men were subject to a specific mitzva to marry and have children. And not everyone took the Weinbergs' hard line on procreation — according to one rabbi I'd met, a psychologist, the halacha permitted contraception when necessary to preserve a woman's health, including her emotional health. Nor were the role divisions in the family absolute; no law actually forbade women to work outside the home, or men to share housework. Even within the bounds of Judaism I could be a feminist of sorts, crusading for reforms like equal education, perhaps contesting the biased halachic interpretations of male rabbis. And my experience would put me in a unique position to reach women like me and bring them back.

In private I could have this fantasy, even take it seriously. Which would not stop me, an hour or a minute later, from getting into a furious argument with a man. It was one thing to consider the abstract possibility that women's role in Judaism was not inherently oppressive, another to live in a culture that made me feel oppressed. Once when Mike and I were dinner guests of another of his teachers I complained, "You know, it makes me feel like a servant when you sit there like a lump while I help serve and clean up."

"It isn't customary for the men to help," Mike said, "and if I got up I'd make everybody uncomfortable, including the women." He had a point — when in Rome and all that — but it was a point he was not exactly loath to make. The fact was that for Mike, moving from Western secular society to Orthodox Judaism had meant an increase in status and privilege; for me it meant a loss.

One night Mike and I got together with Dick Berger, one of his best friends at the yeshiva. Mike was very high on Dick, who, he said, was an unusually perceptive person with a gift for sensing someone's emotional blocks. He had been encouraging Mike to get more connected to his feelings. I had met Dick once and he had told me a little about himself. He had been a newspaper reporter in Pittsburgh, had written an unpublished novel, had been into psychedelics and Transcendental Meditation. Later he had told Mike that he felt I had seen him only as material for my article. I didn't think that was true, but I worried about it anyway. I hated it when people claimed to know my motives better than I did, but I always worried that they were right.

The conversation that night was pleasant enough until Dick and I got into an argument about men sharing child care. Dick suggested that 3000 years of tradition shouldn't be tampered with, and I started getting angry in a way I knew from experience led to no good. Then he really pushed the wrong button.

"You're so emotional! Can't we talk about this objectively?"

"You're hardly being objective. It's in your interest as a man to think what you think."

"I'm feeling detached," Dick insisted. "By that I mean attached to my basic essence. You're reacting out of your conditioning in Western culture."

"You're reacting out of your male-supremacist prejudices, only you have 3000 years of tradition on your side."

"But I'm not being aggressive and hostile — you are!"

"You can afford to be 'objective' and 'detached'! You're happy with the system — I'm the one who's being oppressed by it! Why shouldn't I be hostile — what right do you have to demand that we have this conversation on your terms — " My sentence went hurtling off into the inarticulate reaches of un-God-like rage.

Another time, another friend of Mike's: Harvey, a tall, dark, intense South African. "I'm not here because I want to be," he said. "I want freedom and money and the pleasures of the body. I was happy in my nonreligious life — I miss it. But once you know there's a God — "

We started arguing about design and evolution. "Either there's a God," Harvey said, "or all this harmony and purpose is a coincidence."

"Those aren't the only possibilities — "

"And there are vast odds against coincidence. If you had a dart board that had lots of red and just a little white, where do you think your dart would hit?"

"That's a silly analogy," I said.

"What if you had to lay money on it?"

"I'm not going to play this game! It's ridiculous! It's irrelevant!"

Answer me," the prosecutor insisted. "Would you bet on white or red?"

"I'm not Pascal!" I yelled. "And I'm not about to change my entire life because of some abstract intellectual decision about what the odds are on there being a God!"

"The Torah isn't only a carrot, you know. It's a stick, as well. There's punishment — you get cut off — "

And I'm not going to play your guilt game, either! You men are not going to cram your sexist religion down my throat!

There it was, the dirty little secret: I might be persuaded to return to Judaism — but not by a man. After one of our encounters, Reb Noach had declared, "You are emotionally committed to rebelling against the male sex!" He was right, of course, and in principle I agreed that one ought to be wary of such a priori commitments. But whenever I clashed with a man I seemed to end up with a renewed conviction that my rebellion was a matter of simple sanity. Men with their bullshit head trips! Men with their "objectivity": "Let's discuss this rationally — should I remove my foot from your neck, or shouldn't I?"

V. Exodus

And it shalt be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying. What is this? that than shall say unto him, By strength of hand the Lord brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.
—Exodus XIII:14

You know her life was saved by rock and roll. 
—Velvet Underground

Mike and I were walking in Mea Shearim, talking about happiness. My revised departure date was nearly two weeks away, time for plenty of changes, but I knew that I would not, at least for the present, become an Orthodox Jew. My decision had involved no epiphany, no cathartic moment of truth; my doubts remained and perhaps always would. But to put it that way was looking at it backward. The fact was that only a compelling, inescapable moment of truth could have made me religious. Nothing less could shake my presumption in favor of a life that made me happy.

From Mike's point of view, I was refusing to accept the truth because of a strong emotional resistance; though he too had resisted, his unhappiness with secular life had made it easier to give up. On the other hand, he kept suggesting, I might be a lot less happy than I thought.

"Dick sees you as a very unhappy person," Mike said. "And Reb Noach thinks you're really unhappy."

I felt a twinge of resentment — who were these people, who hardly knew me, to call me unhappy? — mixed with anxiety. Was I fooling myself? I didn't think so. I was not perfectly happy, or as happy as I wanted to be, but in spite of my unresolved problems I was happier than not. Having problems, even serious ones, was not the same as being unhappy. I knew the difference because I had experienced it. For about seven years, beginning the year I started college, I had suffered from a severe depression. At the time I hadn't called it that; I didn't know what to call it. I wasn't especially sad; I just had this puzzling sense that nothing was quite real, that my life was, as I put it to myself, all procedure and no substance. Most of my activities, however theoretically enjoyable, secretly disappointed me. Reading my favorite poets, camping in Yosemite, marching on CORE picket lines, making love, somehow I nearly always felt like a spectator. When I got married I knew I was making a mistake but felt powerless to act on that knowledge; no matter how a movie may horrify you, you don't yell "No!" at it or smash the projector. I was conscious that all was not well, but then, I thought, perhaps everyone felt this way, perhaps this was just the way life was. In the beginning that thought jibed neatly with the spirit of the time — the tail end of the silent Fifties.

My depression had begun gradually, for no obvious reason, and ended the same way. But over the years my memories of descent and recovery had crystallized around a few symbolic events. The first occurred when I was a Barnard freshman infatuated with a Columbia sophomore, an old friend from high school. One day I ran into him on the street and casually suggested — we were friends, right? — getting together sometime. He looked uncomfortable and mumbled a nonanswer. To my surprise I felt almost no pain. I noted that fact with detached interest. How sensible, I thought. Why cry over a situation I have no power to change? Four years later, when I was living in Berkeley, I heard Bob Dylan for the first time and was an instant fanatic. Dylan's voice got straight through to me, and what it said was, No, this is not just the way life is. Then a friend lent me Wilhelm Reich's classic, Character Analysis. I had never heard of Reich, and the book was a revelation: among other things, it contained a precise description of my emotional state. Other people had been in the same condition and been cured! I was not hopeless! It took me a while to pick up on these messages, but eventually I left my husband, returned to New York, became a journalist, decided I thought I was really a radical, and fell in love. Somewhere along the line I noticed that my strange remoteness was gone.

I had had bouts of depression since then — the worst one had driven me to my therapist — and in occasional moments of stress I had reverted to staring at the movie. But I felt certain that I would never again lose myself in so terrible a way. In retrospect, it was clear that what had done me in were my conflicts about growing up female — conflicts I still felt. The difference was that I had decided to engage and struggle with life rather than withdraw from it. And making that decision — as often as necessary — was what happiness was about. I agreed with the Jewish insistence that happiness was a choice. Yet how I had gained the strength to choose remained a mystery, part of the larger mystery of how one connected with Reality. Like the inexplicable, ineffable liberation I'd experienced on acid, my emergence from despair had ultimately depended on what religious people call the grace of God.

Not that external circumstances were irrelevant. Things might have been very different if it had not been for the Sixties — and especially for rock & roll. Rock had been a major factor in my recovery; it had had the power to move me when almost nothing else did. I had been an ardent rock 'n' roll fan in high school. (Sometimes I thought this was why my depression hadn't hit until I arrived at Barnard where — this was 1958 — you were still supposed to dance to Lester Lanin.) But by the early Sixties I had largely abandoned pop for folk music. Still, when Dylan released his first rock album I was excited; I felt he had brought it all back home in more ways than one. After my marriage broke up in 1965 I started listening to AM radio again. The Sixties renaissance had begun; the pop charts were dominated by the Beatles and Stones and their epigoni, by Motown and folk rock. My new lover was not only obsessed with the music but self-conscious about its cultural significance and its influence on our lives in a way that was new to me. I began to make my own connections. My first serious article was a long essay on Dylan.

Mike had once been a rock fan, but since becoming religious he had come to see rock as a drug, an escapist distraction. He also considered my writing a suspect activity; he and Dick Berger agreed that journalism, like traveling, was a way of observing life rather than participating in it.

"Do you think you would have gotten more out of being, here if you had just come and gotten involved instead of having to think about your article?" Mike asked.

"I don't know," I said. "But if I hadn't decided to write an article I probably wouldn't have come."

Without the protection of my writer's role — my license to observe — I might not have had the courage to come. But more important, my overwhelming urge to write about a subject that touched every major issue in my life had routed a powerful impulse to repress, sit tight, let inertia take over; my decision to face up to my spiritual crisis was inseparable from my compulsion to observe and analyze it, to pursue every last connection. Anyway, writing was not just observing — it was sharing one's observations, a social act. It was also hard work. My identity as a writer might, as Reb Noach had suggested, be a prop for my ego, but it also had something to do with taking my work seriously. I had not begun thinking of myself as "a writer" until I had changed my attitude from "Right now I'm writing, maybe next year I'll study psychology" to "I'm going to stop playing games and commit myself to being the best writer I can be." Now, looking back on that change, I saw it as another crucial step toward happiness.

Clarity or death! Reb Noach insisted, and if there was one bit of clarity that emerged from all my confusion it was the conviction that my happiness was not illusory. As I tried to explain that conviction to Mike, I felt suddenly disgusted with my current funk. No wonder Dick and Reb Noach thought I was unhappy. I was a mess. I had gained ten pounds and developed a cold. I was sleeping later and later. If I had a serious talk with someone it exhausted me so much I would run back to the security of Shimoni Street and take a nap. "When we act out of fear of pain we're choosing death," Reb Noach was always saying. "The Torah says, 'Choose life!'" I had been running from the pain of uncertainty and conflict, had even thought, "I can't stand any more of this — I'm going to kill myself." How absurdly self-important!

Perhaps it was sheer determination to prove Mike wrong, but my mood slowly began to change. I began, finally, to respond to the beauty of Jerusalem, to the hills and the peculiar atmospheric sparkle I had noticed nowhere else. I felt as if I'd been let out of prison.

Passover was approaching. I had deliberately scheduled my trip so that I would be in Israel for the week-long holiday. The Passover Seder — which was supposed to be celebrated on each of the first two nights — was the one Jewish ritual my family regularly observed. Most years we had our Seders with my mother's sister's family; my uncle, who was observant though not Orthodox, presided at the ceremony. For the rest of us Passover was less a religious occasion than a family party, a spring version of Thanksgiving. Still, it was impossible to retell the Exodus story year after year and be unaffected by it. It was, after all, a story about escaping oppression for freedom, and I was fond of thinking of it in contemporary political and psychological terms; to me the Seder's concluding invocation — "Next year in Jerusalem!" — expressed hope for both kinds of liberation. To Orthodox Jews, however, Passover meant something very different; as I had learned attending Lorie's classes, the traditional definition of the freedom the Exodus represented was a mirror image of my own.

Passover commemorates a historical event — the deliverance of the Jewish people from slavery in Egypt, the prelude to the revelation of the Torah. But for the religious Jew it is also an ongoing reality. The Haggadah (the account of the Exodus read at the Seder) says, "In every generation each individual is bound to regard himself as if he personally had gone forth from Egypt." According to tradition, Egypt represents materialism, hedonism, amorality. To relive the Exodus is to affirm one's liberation from bondage to the Pharaoh within — the yeitzer hara — and one's readiness to live in true freedom, that is, under God's law. This theme is made concrete in the central symbol of Passover, the matzo — unleavened bread. Because the fleeing Jews did not have time to let their bread rise, it is forbidden during Passover to eat or possess bread or any food made with leaven; symbolically, leaven represents the expansion of the yeitzer hara.

Reb David, a young teacher at Aish HaTorah, and his wife Ruth had invited Mike and me for the first Seder. In the morning we went over to help with last-minute preparations. Ruth put me to work hemming her older son's new holiday pants. Later I played with the kids, who had been sent out on the porch with a bowl of nuts to crack. A week ago their noise, mess and bickering would have driven me further into myself; now I was actually having fun.

The Seder began around eight. The idea of the ceremony is to teach everyone — especially the children present — as much about the Exodus and its meaning as possible. Reb David went over each page of the Haggadah, asking questions, discussing various rabbis' interpretations, and by the time we reached the end of the first part — which we had to do before we could eat — it was almost midnight. After dinner we carried on for two more hours. The Seder ended — I had wondered about this beforehand — with the traditional words: "Next year in Jerusalem."

Later in the week, Mike and I were guests at the Weinbergs', along with several vacationing students of both sexes. I was very conscious of the rebbetsen, who seemed continually busy — though her admiring female guests competed with each other for jobs, there was always more to do — and continually serene. Occasionally one of the kids gave her a hard time, balking at some little chore. Long after the average parent would have been shrieking with frustration, the rebbetsen would calmly repeat her request — or else, with no visible resentment, she would do the task herself.

Feeling guilty about my own lack of patience and selflessness, a lack I was sure was obvious to everyone, I slinked around trying to be inconspicuous. Finally the rebbetsen cornered me.

"I think," she began, "that you think you have to hide your femininity to be taken seriously."

For a moment I was speechless. "Why do you think that?"

"Well, for instance, the way you dress. The way you wear your hair."

Oh, if that's all she means, I thought. She doesn't realize, I'm only looking this way because I've been depressed. I knew I had been neglecting my appearance. Most days I stuck my long hair under a scarf so I wouldn't have to bother with it, and I couldn't wear anything with a waistline because I'd gained so much weight. On the other hand, the baggy dress I had on was actually quite fashionable in New York, and besides, since my normal jeans-and-T-shirt wardrobe was halachically unacceptable, what was I supposed to wear, and anyway, wasn't this the same old oppressive business of always judging a woman by her looks. . . . Nice try, but it won't do, I admitted. Face it: she's right.

The big lie of male supremacy is that women are less than fully human; the basic task of feminism is to expose that lie and fight it on every level. Yet for all my feminist militance I was, it seemed, secretly afraid that the lie was true — that my humanity was hopelessly at odds with my ineluctably female sexuality — while the rebbetsen, staunch apostle of traditional femininity, did not appear to doubt for a moment that she could be both a woman and a serious person. Which was only superficially paradoxical, for if you were absolutely convinced that the Jewish woman's role was ordained by God, and that it was every bit as important spiritually as the man's, how could you believe the lie?

I was too much the product of Western libertarian values to travel the rebbetsen's route to self-acceptance, and so far I had not succeeded in finding my own. I did, however, have an idea where to look. For me, the question of women's liberation was bound up with the question of sex itself. And one reason I could not accept Judaism was that I could not swallow the Jewish view of sex. Though Jews regarded sex as a gift of God, to be enjoyed under the proper conditions, the sexual drive, like all physical desires, was seen as destructive unless strictly controlled. Male sexuality was particularly suspect; it was assumed that men naturally sought to gratify a selfish, exploitative, insatiable lust totally divorced from love or social responsibility. I believed — with Wilhelm Reich, who had rejected Freud's contention that the sexual instincts were inherently antisocial — that alienated lust was not natural at all, but the aberration of a culture that viewed women as objects and the penis as an instrument of conquest and possession; I believed that when people were in touch with Reality the boundary between lust and love dissolved. And I believed that since women had not been conquerors they were more likely to see the truth: that natural sexuality had nothing to do with conquest, that it required, on the contrary, a complete mutual surrender of egos. Sexually, it was men who were more estranged from their humanity; women who were closer to what we all must become. I knew the truth, had always known it — and it scared me to death. Which was why I had not yet been able to make the most important choices of all: to admit that surrender was not necessarily weakness; to stop trying to prove I could be as invulnerable as any man.

On my last night in Jerusalem I went back for a final visit with the Weinbergs. Reb Noach was talking to a young visitor named Ron. Ron was explaining that he had come to Israel to get his head straight, figure out what to do with his life. Did he want to take over his father's diamond-polishing business, or what?

"Come to our yeshiva," Reb Noach said. "Find out what Judaism has to say about these questions. For instance, why are we here? What are we here for?"

"To serve God?"

"No. The world was created to give man pleasure. The Torah tells us how to get it. The Almighty didn't want us wandering around like chickens with their heads chopped off."

Ron was obviously interested, and Reb Noach began urging him to come to Aish Ha Torah for a week.

"I can't," said Ron. "I've committed myself to work on my kibbutz till the end of July. And my girlfriend is there."

"Don't worry about the kibbutz. They can get someone to take your place. What are you there for? You won't find the answers to your questions on a kibbutz."

"I can't come now," said Ron. "But I promise in three months I'll be back."

"Come now," Reb Noach persisted. "Who knows what could happen in three months? A man should never say, 'When I have time I'll study.'"

"I can't," said Ron, "but my mind is really blown by your concern."

I made my goodbyes. Reb Noach gave me some parting advice: "Jews say, whatever else you do, be happy. Even if you're a lawbreaker, just fulfill that one commandment."

In the morning Mike went with me to the airport. We stood there awkwardly, unable to say most of what we felt. For the first time since this long trip had begun, I had the old flash that he was my male mirror image.

Judaism teaches the conventional patriarchal idea that men have more of a bent for abstract reasoning, women for intuitive understanding. I believe that this split is social, not biological — that in a society where men rule and women nurture, it makes sense for men to develop their intellect at the expense of their emotions and for women to do the opposite. Still, I agree that although the difference is probably not innate, and certainly not absolute — I, for one, am more cerebral than most of the men I know — it does exist. And at the moment Mike and I were a study in contrasting male and female sensibilities. I was leaving Israel, with all the intellectual questions unresolved, because in the end I trusted my feelings and believed in acting on them. Though I might use logic as a weapon against uncertainty, I did not, finally, have Mike's faith that it would lead me to the truth.

Mike had been 24 when he became religious. I had been 23 when I came out of my deadly depression. It seemed to me that both changes represented the same basic decision to be happy. But mine had been a purely intuitive decision, to allow myself to feel; his had presented itself as an intellectual decision, to go where his logic led. Perhaps our paths were equally valid. Perhaps not. As I kissed my brother goodbye I still did not know whether my refusal to believe was healthy self-assertion or stubborn egotism; the Jews, the Bible tells us, are a stiff-necked people.

I arrived exhausted at Kennedy, retrieved my baggage, slogged through customs and went outside to wait for my parents to pick me up. Only then did I allow myself a moment of enormous relief. I had made it after all. No crash, no bomb, no hijacker, no unexplained delay. I was here in New York, body and soul intact. And then I thought, so what? Suddenly I was quite unable to understand what I had been so anxious to come back to. The airport was bleak and sterile. The weather was unseasonably cold, and a freaky windstorm was making everyone run for cover. I huddled in the doorway of the terminal, watching the cars go by like an endless procession of anti-American clichés. When my parents drove up I felt another surge of relief, but on the way back to their house my confusion returned. Where did I belong? What did I want?

The following evening my father drove me home to my apartment in Manhattan. The windstorm had blown away the smog, and from the expressway we had an unusually clear view of the harbor and the skyline. It was dusk, the lights of the city were beginning to blink on, and I was seized with an almost religious tenderness for New York and its special beauty. Yet at the same time, staring at those glittering lights, I saw something else: the temptations of Egypt. My eyes filled, and I thought — groping for irony I could not quite reach —

How does it feel 
To be on your own 
With no direction home 
Like a complete unknown? *



anis Joplin was born in 1943 and grew up in Port Arthur, Texas. She began singing in bars and coffeehouses, first locally, then in Austin, where she spent most of a year at the University of Texas. In 1966, she went to San Francisco and got together with a rock band in search of a singer. Big Brother and the Holding Company. The following summer Big Brother performed at the Monterey Pop Festival; Janis got raves from the fans and the critics and from then on she was a star. 'Cheap Thrills', Big Brother's first major album (there had been an early record on a small-time label), came out in July 1968. By then there were tensions between Janis and the group, and she left soon afterward.

With her new backup band she made another album, 'I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama!' But the band never quite jelled, and in the spring of 1970, Janis formed another, Full-Tilt Boogie. They spent most of the summer touring, then went to Los Angeles to record an album, 'Pearl'. It was Janis's last. On October 4th, 1970, she died of an overdose of heroin.

* * *

The hippie rock stars of the late Sixties merged two versions of that hardy American myth, the free individual. They were stars, which meant achieving liberation by becoming rich and famous on their own terms; and they were, or purported to be, apostles of cultural revolution, a considerably more ambitious and romantic vision of freedom that nevertheless had a similar economic foundation. Young Americans were in a sense the stars of the world, drawing on an overblown prosperity that could afford to indulge all manner of rebellious and experimental behavior. The combination was inherently unstable – Whitman's open road is not, finally, the Hollywood Freeway, and in any case neither stardom nor prosperity could deliver what it seemed to promise. For a fragile historical moment rock transcended those contradictions; in its aftermath our pop heroes found themselves grappling, like the rest of us, with what are probably enduring changes in the white American consciousness – changes that have to do with something very like an awareness of tragedy. It is in this context that Janis Joplin developed as an artist, a celebrity, a rebel, a woman, and it is in this context that she died.

100 Greatest Singers of All Time: Janis Joplin

Joplin belonged to that select group of pop figures who mattered as much for themselves as for their music; among American rock performers she was second only to Bob Dylan in importance as a creator/recorder/embodiment of her generation's history and mythology. She was also the only woman to achieve that kind of stature in what was basically a male club, the only Sixties culture hero to make visible and public women's experience of the quest for individual liberation, which was very different from men's. If Janis's favorite metaphors – singing as fucking (a first principle of rock and roll) and fucking as liberation (a first principle of the cultural revolution) – were equally approved by her male peers, the congruence was only on the surface. Underneath – just barely – lurked a feminist (or prefeminist) paradox.

The male-dominated counterculture defined freedom for women almost exclusively in sexual terms. As a result, women endowed the idea of sexual liberation with immense symbolic importance; it became charged with all the secret energy of an as yet suppressed larger rebellion. Yet to express one's rebellion in that limited way was a painfully literal form of submission. Whether or not Janis understood that, her dual personalusty hedonist and suffering victim – suggested that she felt it. Dope, another term in her metaphorical equation (getting high as singing as fucking as liberation) was, in its more sinister aspect, a pain-killer and finally a killer, Which is not to say that the good times weren't real, as far as they went. Whatever the limitations of hippie/rock star life, it was better than being a provincial matron – or a lonely weirdo.

For Janis, as for others of us who suffered the worst fate that can befall an adolescent girl in America – unpopularity – a crucial aspect of the cultural revolution was its assault on the rigid sexual styles of the Fifties. Joplin's metamorphosis from the ugly duckling of Port Arthur to the peacock of Haight-Ashbury meant, among other things, that a woman who was not conventionally pretty, who had acne and an intermittent weight problem and hair that stuck out, could not only invent her own beauty (just as she invented her wonderful sleazofreak costumes) out of sheer energy, soul, sweetness, arrogance, and a sense of humor, but have that beauty appreciated. Not that Janis merely took advantage of changes in our notions of attractiveness; she herself changed them. It was seeing Janis Joplin that made me resolve, once and for all, not to get my hair straightened. And there was a direct line from that sort of response to those apocryphal burned bras and all that followed.

Direct, but not simple. Janis once crowed, "They're paying me $50,000 a year to be like me." But the truth was that they were paying her to be a personality, and the relation of public personality to private self – something every popular artist has to work out – is especially problematic for a woman. Men are used to playing roles and projecting images in order to compete and succeed. Male celebrities tend to identify with their mask-making, to see it as creative and – more or less – to control it. In contrast, women need images simply to survive. A woman is usually aware, on some level, that men do not allow her to be her "real self," and worse, that the acceptable masks represent men's fantasies, not her own. She can choose the most interesting image available, present it dramatically, individualize it with small elaborations, undercut it with irony. But ultimately she must serve some male fantasy to be loved – and then it will be only the fantasy that is loved anyway. The female celebrity is confronted with this dilemma in its starkest form. Joplin's revolt against conventional femininity was brave and imaginative, but it also dovetailed with a stereotype – the ballsy, one-of-the-guys chick who is a needy, vulnerable cream puff underneath – cherished by her legions of hip male fans. It may be that she could have pushed beyond it and taken the audience with her; that was one of the possibilities that made her death an artistic as well as human calamity. There is, for instance, the question of her bisexuality. People who knew Janis differ on whether sexual relationships with women were an important part of her life, and I don't know the facts. In any case, a public acknowledgment of bisexual proclivities would not necessarily have contradicted her image; it could easily have been passed off as more pull-out-the-stops hedonism or another manifestation of her all-encompassing need for love. On the other hand, she could have used it to say something new about women and liberation. What makes me wonder is something I always noticed and liked about Janis: unlike most female performers whose act is intensely erotic, she never made me feel as if I were crashing an orgy that consisted of her and the men in the audience. When she got it on at a concert, she got it on with everybody.

Still, the songs she sang assumed heterosexual romance; it was men who made her hurt, who took another little piece of her heart. Watching men groove on Janis, I began to appreciate the resentment many black people feel toward whites who are blues freaks. Janis sang out of her pain as a woman, and men dug it. Yet it was men who caused the pain, and if they stopped causing it they would not have her to dig. In a way, their adulation was the cruelest insult of all. And Janis's response – to sing harder, get higher, be worshiped more – was rebellious, acquiescent, bewildered all at once. When she said, "Onstage I make love to 25,000 people, then I go home alone," she was not merely repeating the cliché of the sad clown or the poor little rich girl. She was noting that the more she gave the less she got, and that honey, it ain't fair.

Like most women singers, Joplin did not write many songs; she mostly interpreted other people's. But she made them her own in a way few singers dare to do. She did not sing them so much as struggle with them, assault them. Some critics complained, not always unfairly, that she strangled them to death, but at her best she whipped them to new life. She had an analogous adversary relationship with the musical form that dominated her imagination – the blues. Blues represented another external structure, one with its own contradictory tradition of sexual affirmation and sexist conservatism. But Janis used blues conventions to reject blues sensibility. To sing the blues is a way of transcending pain by confronting it with dignity, but Janis wanted nothing less than to scream it out of existence. Big Mama Thornton's classic rendition of "Ball and Chain" carefully balances defiance and resignation, toughness and vulnerability. She almost pities her oppressor: "I know you're gonna miss me, baby . . . You'll find that your whole life will be like mine, all wrapped up in a ball and chain." Her singing conveys, above all, her determination to survive abuse. Janis makes the song into one long frenzied, despairing protest. Why, why, why, she asks over and over, like a child unable to comprehend injustice. "It ain't fair . . . this can't be . . . I just wanted to hold you . . . All I ever wanted to do was to love you." The pain is overwhelming her, "draggin' me down . . . maybe, maybe you can help me – c'mon help me." There are similar differences between her recording of "Piece of My Heart" and Erma Franklin's. When Franklin sings it, it is a challenge: no matter what you do to me, I will not let you destroy my ability to be human, to love. Joplin seems rather to be saying, surely if I keep taking this, if I keep setting an example of love and forgiveness, surely he has to understand, change, give me back what I have given.

Her pursuit of pleasure had the same driven quality; what it amounted to was refusal to admit of any limits that would not finally yield to the virtue of persistence – try just a little bit harder – and the magic of extremes. This war against limits was largely responsible for the electrifying power of Joplin's early performances; it was what made Cheap Thrills a classic, in spite of unevenness and the impossibility of duplicating on a record the excitement of her concerts. After the split with Big Brother, Janis retrenched considerably, perhaps because she simply couldn't maintain that level of intensity, perhaps for other reasons that would have become clear if she had lived. My uncertainty on this point makes me hesitate to be too dogmatic about my conviction that leaving Big Brother was a mistake.

I was a Big Brother fan. I thought they were better musicians than their detractors claimed, but more to the point, technical accomplishment, in itself, was not something I cared about. I thought it was an ominous sign that so many people did care – including Janis. It was, in fact, a sign that the tenuous alliance between mass culture and bohemianism – or, in my original formulation, the fantasy of stardom and the fantasy of cultural revolution – was breaking down. But the breakdown was not as neat as it might appear. For the elitist concept of "good musicianship" was as alien to the holistic, egalitarian spirit of rock and roll as the act of leaving one's group the better to pursue one's individual ambition was alien to the holistic, egalitarian pretensions of the cultural revolutionaries. If Joplin's decision to go it alone was influenced by all the obvious professional/commercial pressures, it also reflected a conflict of values within the counterculture itself – a conflict that foreshadowed its imminent disintegration. And again, Janis's femaleness complicated the issues, raised the stakes. She had less room to maneuver than a man in her position, fewer alternatives to fall back on if she blew it. If she had to choose between fantasies, it made sense for her to go with stardom as far as it would take her.

But I wonder if she really had to choose, if her choice was not in some sense a failure of nerve and therefore of greatness. Janis was afraid Big Brother would hold her back, but if she had thought it was important enough, she might have been able to carry them along, make them transcend their limitations. There is more than a semantic difference between a group and a backup band. Janis had to relate to the members of Big Brother as spiritual (not to mention financial) equals even though she had more talent than they, and I can't help suspecting that that was good for her not only emotionally and socially but aesthetically. Committed to the hippie ethic of music-for-the-hell-of-it--if only because there was no possibility of their becoming stars on their own – Big Brother helped Janis sustain the amateur quality that was an integral part of her effect. Their zaniness was a salutary reminder that good times meant silly fun--remember "Caterpillar"? – as well as Dionysiac abandon; it was a relief from Janis's extremism and at the same time a foil for it. At their best moments Big Brother made me think of the Beatles, who weren't (at least in the beginning) such terrific musicians either. Though I'm not quite softheaded enough to imagine that by keeping her group intact Janis Joplin could somehow have prevented or delayed the end of an era, or even saved her own life, it would have been an impressive act of faith. And acts of faith by public figures always have reverberations, one way or another.

Such speculation is of course complicated by the fact that Janis died before she really had a chance to define her post-San Francisco, post-Big Brother self. Her last two albums, like her performances with the ill-fated Kozmic Blues band, had a tentative, transitional feel. She was obviously going through important changes; the best evidence of that was "Me and Bobby McGee," which could be considered her "Dear Landlord." Both formally – as a low-keyed, soft, folkie tune – and substantively – as a lyric that spoke of choices made, regretted and survived, with the distinct implication that compromise could be a positive act – what it expressed would have been heresy to the Janis Joplin of Cheap Thrills. "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose" is as good an epitaph for the counterculture as any; we'll never know how – or if – Janis meant to go on from there.

Janis Joplin's death, like that of a fighter in the ring, was not exactly an accident. Yet it's too easy to label it either suicide or murder, though it involved elements of both. Call it rather an inherent risk of the game she was playing, a game whose often frivolous rules both hid and revealed a deadly serious struggle. The form that struggle took was incomplete, shortsighted, egotistical, self-destructive. But survivors who give in to the temptation to feel superior to all that are in the end no better than those who romanticize it. Janis was not so much a victim as a casualty. The difference matters.

Thirty years ago this week, on December 8th, 1980, John Lennon was murdered in New York. He was emerging from five years of seclusion after the release of Double Fantasy, the masterpiece he had just finished recording with his wife, Yoko Ono. In my lifetime, the only comparable event was the assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Photos: John Lennon's Final Years

Lennon's death hit particularly hard at Rolling Stone. John had shared many of his final hours with us as we were preparing a cover story to celebrate his return to public life. Three days earlier, our reporter, Jonathan Cott, the only person besides me whose name has appeared on the masthead since our first issue in 1967, had interviewed John for more than nine hours. When Jonathan, who had known John and Yoko for years, showed up at their apartment in the Dakota that evening, John seemed nervous. "Don't worry, it's just Jonathan," Yoko told John. "It's OK." And with that, they began.

This article appears in the December 23, 2010 - January 6, 2011 issue of Rolling Stone. The issue is available now on newsstands and in the online archive.

The conversation was a wide-ranging journey through John's thoughts and dreams. As the talk extended deep into the night, John invited Jonathan to join him and Yoko at the Record Plant to hear some of the new music they were creating.

"He was the same guy he was before," Cott recalls. "A joyous, vibrant, subversive, acerbic, funny, always inspiring, fearless guy. He hadn't lost it or become bitter or cynical. He never gave up." John's last words to Jonathan, as he escorted him to the elevator at 4 a.m., said it all: "I love her and we're together."

Two days later, Annie Leibovitz, our chief photographer at the time, made her trek to the Dakota to shoot the cover. She created one of the 20th century's most unforgettable images: a naked Lennon embracing a clothed Ono — named in 2005 by the American Society of Magazine Editors as the greatest cover of the past 40 years. When John and Yoko saw the photo, they told her, "You've captured our relationship exactly." What you saw in the photo was the real John — open, daring, vulnerable, warmhearted. Nobody could have guessed it would be our final glimpse of him, or that his long conversation with Rolling Stone would turn out to be his goodbye to the world. Although John did a radio interview on the day of his murder, his talk with Jonathan constituted the last time he spoke in-depth to a reporter before the tragedy.

When John was killed, our plans for a celebratory profile of a reinvigorated artist turned into a mournful tribute. Jonathan listened to his two interview tapes, pulled out a few quotes for his story, and stashed the tapes in a closet, where they sat for nearly three decades — until he discovered them, held together by a decaying rubber band, earlier this year. It seemed appropriate on the 30th anniversary of John's death to present the interview in full, along with a portfolio of photographs from Annie's sessions. Some appear here in print for the first time, among them a more intense shot of John and Yoko embracing.

We also asked Yoko to tell us about the final hours of John's life. Her reminiscence, "John's Last Days," is the first time she has written about that period, discussing everything from the making of Double Fantasy to their final intimate moments together. Both pieces remind us of how much John left behind, from his groundbreaking music to his and Yoko's ongoing dedication to the cause of world peace. His life continues to transform the world and make it a better place in ways that none of us, not even John, could have imagined. But then, that is exactly what John spent his life trying to tell us: Imagine.

It was an outcome that took even the president's closest advisers by surprise. George W. Bush emerged from the election with fifty-one percent of the popular vote — the first outright majority for any presidential candidate since his father in 1988, and the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 to be re-elected while gaining seats in both the House and the Senate. To get away from the battle of the ideological elites and make sense of the election, Rolling Stone met with Ruy Teixeira and Peter Hart — two analysts deeply grounded in public-opinion research — and David Gergen, a man we consider one of the most dispassionate observers of modern political history.

Teixeira, a joint fellow at the Center for American Progress and the Century Foundation, is co-author of The Emerging Democratic Majority, selected as one of the best books of 2002 by The Economist. Hart, known for his nonpartisan poll for NBC and The Wall Street Journal, has conducted public-opinion research for thirty governors and forty U.S. senators, from Hubert Humphrey to Jay Rockefeller. Gergen, director of the Center for Public Leadership in the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has served in the White House as an adviser to presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton.

Let's start with the major factors in Bush's victory. 
RUY TEIXEIRA: If you want to look at ground zero of how Bush expanded his coalition, the key change from 2000 was that he did a lot better among white voters. His margin of victory among whites widened from twelve to seventeen points — and almost all of that was among white working-class women.

DAVID GERGEN: The decrease in the gender gap alone was enough to give him the victory. But he also increased his margin among Hispanics. And I don't think there's any doubt that in some key states, such as Ohio, he rallied his base through a strong organization and symbolic politics — especially the ban on gay marriage.

PETER HART: The other thing that's really important to understand is the Mississippi River: Since 1912, whoever has won a plurality of states along the Mississippi has won the presidency. This year, a sense of Republicanism crept up the river. The president won Missouri — which was always a toss-up state — by more than seven percent. Iowa flipped in his direction, and in Minnesota and Wisconsin, we waited all night to find out that Kerry had just barely carried each of those states. In state legislatures, the story is even more dramatic: going from huge Democratic majorities in the Seventies to watching the GOP dominate in Missouri and Wisconsin. Only Illinois remains solidly in Democratic hands.

TEIXEIRA: I don't think it's quite as gruesome in some of the battleground states as Peter is portraying it. If you look at Wisconsin and Minnesota, the Democratic margin actually widened slightly. According to an analysis I did of Bush's increased margin, about half of it came from solid red states — states that Bush won by six points or more in 2000. And about half of that increase came from just four states: Tennessee, Georgia, Texas and Alabama. Only a fifth of the increase in Bush's margin came from the battleground states, and about half of that increase came just from Florida. So Bush actually made comparatively modest gains in the battleground states.

Nobody mentioned the Christian right. Karl Rove's strategy was to turn out 4 million evangelicals who didn't vote last time. Did he succeed in doing that?
TEIXEIRA: Because of the way exit polls were conducted this year, we can't know exactly how much evangelical turnout went up.

HART: That's right. But polls of likely voters indicate that it was up vastly — and that voters cared tremendously. We also know that half of all the votes that George Bush got this year came from people who go to religious services on a weekly basis. We're not just talking about fundamentalists — we're talking about Catholics, Jews, black Baptists, everyone.

GERGEN: What strikes me is that the Republicans are building a different sort of alliance system. For decades, Democrats have built alliances of voters through government programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Support from believers in those programs has enabled the Democrats to dominate national politics for a long time. The Republicans, in shrinking government, have increasingly turned to churches as away to build alliances and to do their recruiting in quiet ways; it often takes place below the radar screen of the media. That's one of the reasons the election presented some surprises for us.

Are there places beyond churches that the Republicans are building alliances?
GERGEN: They've been highly successful at building alliances through the military. Not only the people who are in uniform now, but those who have worn a uniform in the past tend to rally to the Republicans in ways beyond what we would have seen, say, forty years ago. That's become a reliable source of voting strength for them.

Did the ballot initiatives in eleven states banning same-sex marriage have an effect? 
TEIXEIRA: It helped create an environment, nationally, that was favorable for the Republicans.

GERGEN: My impression is that the country was moving toward a much greater tolerance of gays — and, indeed, an embrace of alternative lifestyles — that went far beyond what we saw, say, twenty years ago. Many voters were perfectly happy in their communities with gays living next door. Had that been left undisturbed, we would have seen far more support for gay unions ten years from now. But the decisions to approve gay marriages in Massachusetts and San Francisco may have spurred voters to make a decision about the issue before they were ready.

HART: I would subscribe to exactly what David said. It was a tactical victory for the Republicans — I don't think it should be interpreted as a referendum on the broader social and constitutional question. In periods of uncertainty and insecurity, the public reaches toward what is safe — and this is definitely a period of insecurity.

TEIXEIRA: That's right. But as we go forward, younger voters are gradually going to move the country in the direction of greater acceptance of gay marriage — whether Karl Rove wants it or not.

Let's talk about the youth vote. What happened with young voters? 
TEIXEIRA:  One of the misperceptions about the election is that young people didn't turn out. In fact, the number of voters under the age of thirty increased substantially. And they went for Kerry by nine points in an election in which the country as a whole went for the other side by three points. That's the biggest difference between youth and the country as a whole that we've seen in the last four elections — even greater than in 1996, when Bill Clinton carried the youth by nineteen points and carried the country as a whole by eight points. I think there's real potential there for the future.

So why are we hearing the youth vote put down by the media? Everyone says they didn't turn out — they failed to elect John Kerry. 
TEIXEIRA: Goodness gracious — they tried their best. To have actually won the election for Kerry, they would have had to vote for him by twenty-five points. So I don't think you can blame it on the youth.

HART: Just the opposite. As Ruy suggests, the youth vote is a tremendous hope for the Democratic Party. I mean, here's a group that in previous elections said, "It doesn't make any difference." This year, all of a sudden they said, "It makes a lot of difference — it's important, and we care." And they turned out — they were active and involved. The way in which youth were communicated to was also a lot wider and broader than before. For the youth, Jon Stewart and Comedy Central made a huge difference in defining an awful lot of the agenda in this election.

GERGEN: There's another reason the youth vote should be encouraging for Democrats. When people enter the voting process and vote for two or three elections in a row for the same party, they tend to vote that way the rest of their lives. So this is a cohort that's going to be more Democratic — and that should give hope to the Democrats as they look ahead.

So should Democrats emphasize the youth vote more as a strategy for the future? 
TEIXEIRA: No. To rely on getting much more out of the youth vote would be foolish. If you want to solve the problem of why you lost this election, that's probably not where you want to go. You want to go more toward the middle. You've got to figure out how to get back some of the Hispanic votes you lost, and, most important, how to shore up your support among whites of modest income and education.

GERGEN: I agree that the Democrats can't rely upon the youth vote to increase much more as a way to win future elections. But they have to make the younger generation a foundational piece of their coalition. And that means that they've got to keep people mobilized and interested in the next four years. There's going to be a tendency among some of the young to become cynical after this election — to throw up their hands and walk away from the process. Some of them have gone through enormous psychological pain at the end of this and would just as soon not think about it anymore. How you convince them that this is just one battle lost in a bigger war — in a longer war — is one of the primary challenges Democrats face. They have to keep the turnout up. Doing that, in itself, is going to be hard.

TEIXEIRA: The bigger question is: What do the Democrats stand for? Democrats in this election ran against Bush. Kerry's program was never very clear to voters. They didn't get where he was coming from. Democrats have to have large and good ideas that people can recognize — ideas voters can summarize in a couple of sentences.

GERGEN: There's a tendency now for Democrats to say, "Who can we find to run next time? Should it be Hillary, or Evan Bayh, or XYZ?" I think that's a terrible mistake — it's a trap. It's far more important, as Ruy just said, for them to focus on what their ideas are, and what they believe in, before they decide who should carry the banner. The conservative movement was first built around a series of ideas and principles — then they went out and found Reagan to ride that wave into the White House. The Democrats have got some soul-searching to do about what they believe in.

TEIXEIRA: We should keep a bit of perspective on this. The last three elections, the Democrats got, respectively, forty-nine, forty-eight and forty-eight percent of the vote. That's not that far off a majority. I mean, you shift a point and a half of the vote and you're just about there. They just need to figure out a way to put their natural constituencies, and growing constituencies, together with a more respectable performance among whites of moderate income. Democrats are not in the position that the Republicans were in after Goldwater was defeated in 1964.

GERGEN: I would argue the contrary. I think they may be in a more dangerous position. The Goldwater coalition was in a deep, deep hole. They were a distinct minority, but they could build from the ground up. The Democrats are in danger of sliding down. They haven't won a majority of the white vote since 1964. They haven't won fifty percent of the national vote since 1976. And in the last six congressional elections — starting with 1994 — they haven't cracked 48.5 percent of the national vote. This is a party that needs to have some deep rethinking — not simply go out and turn a few dials.

HART: David's right. To win, we need to build a coalition differently from before. It doesn't mean selling out on the coalition that has helped to establish the Democratic Party. It means that if we look at this loss just as a small tactical loss, we'll end up digging a deeper hole. The narrowness of the presidential loss hides the fact that the Republicans are the majority party in Congress; Democrats have a steep road ahead in both Congress and state legislatures.

We haven't discussed the war on terrorism. Wasn't the deck kind of stacked against Kerry — challenging an incumbent president during a time of terrible uncertainty?
HART: That certainly is key. I have no doubt in my mind: If there had not been the terrorism threat, George Bush would have lost this election, and lost it decisively. It enabled him to run as the war president. Voters felt it was about safety.

GERGEN: Peter is absolutely right. Prior to 9/11, George Bush was on the arc of a difficult presidency. He would have been a one-term president. The way he rose to the occasion during the weeks after 9/11 was what convinced voters that he would be the safer choice. He did not win because of Iraq — he won despite Iraq.

How much of this goes to Kerry's inability to connect with voters?
HART: Kerry always thought it was about IQ. But it was really about "I like." He never connected. I asked people, "What would it be like to have John Kerry as your next-door neighbor?" You know what they said? "High hedges" [laughter].

TEIXEIRA: Not a good sign.

What were Kerry's strategic mistakes?
GERGEN: His biggest blunder was refusing to say that he would have changed his vote on Iraq had he known then what he knows now. That left him in a position of near incoherence on Iraq for several weeks and cost him precious time in trying to gain an advantage on Bush.

Having said that, I think it would be too easy for Democrats to say, "We lost because of some tactical mistakes Kerry made or because of his lack of likability." Yes, he made some mistakes — but he also ran one heck of a good campaign. He won all three debates, which no challenger has ever done. He raised more money than any Democrat in history and made the Democrats more competitive financially than ever before. And he raised the number of votes at the final election. John Kerry didn't lose this election; George Bush won it — and there's a difference. Democrats would be deluding themselves if they said, "If we just get a better candidate, we'll start winning all the time." That's why it goes back to the notion that they've got to re-examine their ideas — and whether they've got something fresh, interesting and compelling to offer the country.

TEIXEIRA: I agree with David that Kerry ran a solid campaign. But he never really managed to get his program across to the average voter. The Democratic program on the economy, on health care, on how to get out of Iraq — all these things were practically incomprehensible to voters. In one exit poll, voters were asked, "Do you trust Bush to handle the economy?" Fifty-one percent said no. That's not so good for an incumbent president. But voters rated Kerry even worse — fifty-three percent said they didn't trust him to run the economy. That means he never managed to get across what he would do, and how he would do it better.

HART: Ruy is right. Kerry kept talking about the plan, the plan, the plan, the plan — but the public never knew what the plan was. It would be equivalent to Martin Luther King Jr. saying, "I have a dream," but never spelling out the dream that he went on to describe so vividly. I asked voters, "How much confidence do you have in Kerry making the right decisions on domestic issues?" Forty-one percent said a great deal or quite a bit of confidence. Then I asked the same question about George Bush — and the response was forty-one percent. I figured, God, if the Democrats can't dominate on domestic issues, it's because they never got the specifics across.

GERGEN: Bruce Reed wrote a very interesting piece in The Washington Post pointing out something I did not know. It suggests that we're entering a new period of politics. Of the twenty-eight states with the lowest per-capita income, Bush carried twenty-six. In the past, we would all have assumed that low-income states would mostly go Democratic. The fact that their income status does not seem to be tied to how they vote is a major advance for Republicans — and something Democrats have to think a lot about. It's conceivable that Republicans, in continuing to emphasize small government, may have left themselves in a position where Bush was not held as accountable for the loss of jobs, say, in Ohio as he would have been twenty years ago. That, to me, is a big change.

There is also an irony in this. Kerry won all the states with the highest per-capita income. States such as New York, with high per-capita incomes, are the ones that send more tax money to Washington and get less back than the rest of the country. So the Democrats win in blue states that are essentially for bigger government but that get less back from government, while Republicans win in red states that stand for smaller government and are getting more money from the government than they send in.

So you think the Republicans are now the party of the workingman? 
GERGEN: To the degree that the Republican Party is discovering that you can reach out to lower-income working people, whose lives are in huge flux. As Peter was pointing out, those voters are looking for something beyond an economic boost. They don't have much faith in government producing for them anymore, and they're looking for security. And they find it in a wartime president, and in their cultural beliefs. They're looking for anchors. The Republicans have learned how to reach out to those people and offer them some anchors — while Democrats find it harder to talk to them in those terms than they did in the past. There are some big shifts going on. The Republicans are not picking up the majority of working people, but they're picking up significant chunks in rural America who would have voted Democratic twenty years ago. And that, for Democrats, has to be worrisome.

Up to this point, Mick Jagger's solo career has been an incidental affair, something that has surfaced in the interludes between Rolling Stones albums and tours. His previous releases — 1985's She's the Boss, 1987's Primitive Cool and 1993's Wandering Spirit — were earnest, respectable efforts that offered their fair share of pleasures but did not establish a distinct or significant new musical identity for Jagger apart from the Stones. Goddess in the Doorway finds Jagger taking a giant step — not away from the shadow of the Stones but beyond what that understandably history-bound band has been able to achieve on record in recent times.

In terms of consistency, craftsmanship and musical experimentation, Goddess in the Doorway surpasses all his solo work and any Rolling Stones album since Some Girls. It does so by returning to the dance beats, big grooves and modern edge that have characterized the Stones' best work. The key to all the Stones' classics — from "Satisfaction" and "Brown Sugar" to "Miss You" and "Start Me Up" — is that they are built from the rhythm up: Goddess in the Doorway, which was almost entirely constructed around Jagger's rhythm guitar, is a return to that modus operandi.

Jagger has poured his heart into this album. The strongest songs — "Don't Call Me Up," "Brand New Set of Rules," "Hide Away" and "Everybody Getting High" — are also the most candidly personal. In the past, he has slipped into personae — the Street Fighting Man, Jumpin' Jack Flash, the Man of Wealth and Taste — but he lets his guard down to an unprecedented degree on Goddess; the beautiful ballads draw on feelings of loneliness, vulnerability, spiritual yearning and, as always, life with the ladies.

These gains in maturity have taken no toll on Jagger's inner rock & roller. The Street Fighting Man can still swagger at the top of his — or anybody else's — game. Goddess in the Doorway resembles the Stones' best albums in that it's a varied yet cohesive collection of ballads, hard rockers and one country song. But on his own, he is free to cast off the blues-rock anchor that both defines and (at times) confines the Stones. Jagger heads into edgy, danceable modern-rock territory with the throbbing electronic groove of "Gun" and the snarling, whip-crack assault of "Everybody Getting High."

Making the most of this opportunity to stretch himself, Jagger has recruited some outstanding guests, many of them younger artists whom he directly influenced. Rob Thomas of Matchbox Twenty collaborates on the pop-y, melodic opening track, "Visions of Paradise," which boasts a soaring chorus. Lenny Kravitz produces and co-writes "God Gave Me Everything," a driving, riff-propelled rocker that evokes the punkish stomp of the early Stones.

On "Hide Away," one of my favorite tracks, Wyclef Jean helps burnish a subtle reggae- and hip-hop-inflected groove. Employing some of his most moving and nuanced vocal phrasing, he confides, "I'm gonna fly away/And no one's gonna find me." The lyrics portray a guy who's got it all — fame, fortune and the means to indulge any materialistic and hedonistic impulse he might divine — but is wise enough in his late middle age to know there's something more out there.

"Joy," a rocking, gospel-tinged collaboration with Bono of U2 — and featuring an indelible guitar hook from Pete Townshend — offers a revealing glimpse of what Jagger is seeking: "I looked up to the heavens/And a light is on my face/I never never never/Thought I'd find a state of grace." The mark of U2 is overt on "Joy," but the band's influence subtly courses through the rest of the album; like Bono and company in the last decade, Jagger (along with producers Marti Frederiksen and Matt Clifford) has adapted modern rhythms and contemporary production techniques to his own naturalistic rock & roll ends.

"Everybody Getting High," featuring Aerosmith's Joe Perry, and "Lucky Day" are fierce, biting rockers. No one struts or wags a tongue as sharply as Jagger, and "Everybody Getting High," in particular, stands out as a blistering, arena-ready, hard-rock singalong. The absurdist lyrics find Jagger poking fun at scenes from his celebrity life: "My dress designers, they wanna doll me up in blue/Mmm-hmm pretty/Next fall collection, they're gonna show it in the zoo." The tight blues shuffle "Lucky Day" is highlighted by some brief but fiery harmonica playing from Jagger. Like a good blues workout, it leaves you hungry for more, and this masterful use of tension and restraint is part of what makes Goddess in the Doorway so beguiling.

It may seem a truism, but it's worth noting that he is — along with John Lennon, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan and Bono — one of the great male rock voices of this age. And he is in exceptional form on Goddess in the Doorway. If anything, Jagger's voice is rounder and warmer than ever, and he brings a new richness of phrasing to the heartbroken, confessional "Don't Call Me Up" and the extraordinary closing tracks, "Too Far Gone" and "Brand New Set of Rules."

After all of the excursions undertaken on Goddess in the Doorway, Jagger brings it all back home with these last two numbers, which are musically rich and lyrically reflective ballads in the grand tradition of such Stones pillars as "Wild Horses" and "Moonlight Mile." Jagger offers unabashedly human, vulnerable sentiments on "Brand New Set of Rules" (which features daughters Elizabeth and Georgia May on background vocals): "I will be kind, won't be so cruel/I will be sweet, I will be true/. . . I got a brand-new set of rules I got to learn."

It is a clear-eyed and inspired Mick Jagger who crafted Goddess in the Doorway, an insuperably strong record that in time may well reveal itself to be a classic. World, meet Mick Jagger, solo artist.

The tides of history are rising higher and faster these days. Read them right and ride them, or be crushed.

And then along comes Barack Obama, with the kinds of gifts that appear in politics but once every few generations. There is a sense of dignity, even majesty, about him, and underneath that ease lies a resolute discipline.

It's not just that he is eloquent — with that ability to speak both to you and to speak for you — it's that he has a quality of thinking and intellectual and emotional honesty that is extraordinary.

I first learned of Barack Obama from a man who was at the highest level of George W. Bush's political organization through two presidential campaigns. He described the first-term senator from Illinois as "a walk­ing hope machine" and told me that he would not work for any Republi­can candidate in 2008 if Obama was nominated. He challenged me to read Obama's autobiography, Dreams From My Father.

The book was a revelation. Here was a man whose honesty about him­self and understanding of the human condition are both deep and com­passionate. Born to a white mother and an African father, he was raised in multiracial Hawaii and for sev­eral years in Indonesia. He drifted through some druggy teenage years — no apologies! — before emerging as a star at Harvard Law School. He chose to work as a community organizer in the projects of Chicago rather than join the wealthy insider world of corporate law. And as a young adult, he searched, in the distant villages of Kenya, for the father and family he never knew.

As I read all this, so elegantly writ­ten, my mind kept rolling over: Might it be possible? Is there some fate by which we could have this man as presi­dent of the United States?

THROUGHOUT THE PRIMARIES, AND during a visit he paid to our offices, we have come to know Barack Obama, his toughness and his grace. He would not be intimidated, and he declined to back down, when Senator Clinton called him "frankly, naive" for his willing­ness to meet leaders of hostile nations. When one of her top campaign officials tried to smear him for his earlier drug use, he did not equivocate or backtrack. On the matter of experience and capa­bility, he has run an impressive, nearly flawless campaign  one that whupped America's most hard-boiled political infighters. Indeed, Obama was far more prepared to run a presidential campaign — from Day One — than Sena­tor Clinton. And at no point did he go negative with personal attacks or char­acter assassination; as much as they might have been justified, they didn't even seem tempting to him.

Obama has emerged by displaying precisely the kind of character and judgment we need in a president: re­nouncing the politics of fear, speaking frankly on the most pressing issues facing the country and sticking to his principles. He recognizes that running for president is an opportunity to in­spire an entire nation.

All this was made clearer by the contrast with Hillary Clinton, a capable and personable senator who has run the kind of campaign that reminds us of what makes us so discouraged about our politics. Her campaign certainly proved her experience didn't count for much: She was a bad manager and a bad strategist who naturally and easily engaged in the politics of distraction, trivialization and personal attack. She never convinced us that her vote for the war in Iraq was anything other than a strategic political calculation that placed her presidential ambitions above the horrifying consequences of a war. Her calibrated course corrections over the past three years were painful. Like John Kerry — who also voted for the war while planning a presidential run — it helped cost her that goal.

Although Obama declined to attack her personally for her vote for the war in Iraq, he did call it, devastatingly enough, a clear demonstration of her so-called experience and "judgment." He has also spoken forcefully about the need to break the grip of lobbyists — at a time when Clinton is the larg­est recipient of drug-company dona- tions of anyone in Congress. Clinton could not address this issue at all, and neither will John McCain, who is equally a player in Washington's lob­byist culture.

Obama also denounced the Repub­lican campaign of fear. Early in the campaign, John Edwards took the lead, calling the War on Terror a campaign slogan, not a policy. Obama rejected the subtle imagery of false patriotism by not wearing a flag pin in his lapel, and he dismissed the broader notion that the Democratic Party had to find a way to buy into this entire load of fear-mongering War on Terror bullshit — to out-Republican the Republicans — and thus become, in his description of Hill­ary Clinton's macho posturing on foreign policy, little more than "Bush-Cheney lite."

THE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN JOHN Kennedy and Barack Obama come to mind easily: the youth, the magnetism, the natural grace, the eloquence, the wit, the intelligence, the hope of anew generation.

But it might be more to the point to view Obama as Lincolnesque in his own origins, his sobriety and what his­tory now demands.

We have a deeply divided nation, driven apart by economic policies that have deliberately created the largest income disparities in our history, with stunning tax breaks for the wealthiest and subsidies for giant industries. The income of the average citizen is stag-nant, and his quality of life continues to slowly erode from inflation.

We are embittered and hobbled by the unnecessary and failed war in Iraq. We have been worn down by long years of fear- and hate-filled political strategies, assaults on constitutional freedoms, and levels of greed and cyni­cism, that — once seen for what they are — no people of moral values or ethics can tolerate.

A new president must heal these divides, must at long last face the hy­pocrisy and inequity of unprecedented government handouts to oil giants, hedge-fund barons, agriculture com­bines and drug companies. At the same time, the new president must transform our lethal energy economy — replacing oil and coal and the ethanol fraud with green alternatives and strict rain-forest preservation and tough international standards  before the planet becomes inhospitable for most human life. Al­though Obama has been slow to address global warming, I feel confident that his intelligence and morality will lead him clearly on this issue.

We need to recover the spiritual and moral direction that should describe our country and ourselves. We see this in Obama, and we see the promise he represents to bring factions together, to achieve again the unity that drives great change and faces difficult, and in­convenient, truths and peril.

We need to send a message to our­selves and to the world that we truly do stand for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And in electing an Afri­can-American, we also profoundly re­nounce an ugliness and violence in our national character that have been fur­ther stoked by our president in these last eight years.

Like Abraham Lincoln, Barack Obama challenges America to rise up, to do what so many of us long to do: to summon "the better angels of our nature."

hortly after Barack Obama claimed victory in the fight for the Democratic nomination, I joined him aboard his chartered 757 campaign plane as a member of the press corps. He was flying from Chicago to Appleton, Wisconsin, for a town-hall meeting, one of a series he was doing in Midwestern the primaries — and of course, to get some warm-up practice for any town-hall debates he has with John McCain.

The first thing I notice about the plane is how low-key it is, all coach seating from back (the press) to front (the candidate). There is no separate compartment for this potential president; he holds down the second row for himself and his newspapers. There are no more than 10 staffers on the plane and a dozen or more rows are empty, separating the senator from the Secret Service contingent and two dozen members of the traveling press corps. It's not a big day or a big event: The primaries are done, and none of the media big names are along.

So far in this campaign, despite their evident admiration, Obama held the press at a respectful distance. The limit for our interview is going to be 50 minutes, which I think says a lot about him and his campaign. Most every other presidential candidate I've met and interviewed has tended to be gregarious, talkative almost to a fault, eager to please and eager to impress. Obama, by con­trast, is quiet, collected and effortlessly precise.

His calmness is reflected in the smooth and con­trolled campaign he is overseeing. In conversation, his thoughtfulness is punctuated by an easy wit, much as his clockwork campaign is a stage for his eloquence and charismatic gifts as a leader.

I am often asked, "What's he like?" If you really want to know, read Dreams From My Father. It's all in there, and it's a wonderful piece of writing in its own right.

When we are done, his parting words are delivered with a dazzling smile: "OK, brother — take care."

You were endorsed by Bob Dylan a few days ago. What's that mean to you?
I've got to say, having both Dylan and Bruce Springsteen say kind words about you is pretty remarkable. Those guys are icons.

Do you have any favorite Dylan songs?
I've got probably 30 Dylan songs on my iPod. I think I have the entire Blood on the Tracks album on there. Actually, one of my favorites during the political sea­son is "Maggie's Farm." It speaks to me as I listen to some of the political rhetoric.

When did you begin to think you could or should be president? At what stage in your life did that idea first dawn on you?
I would distinguish between thinking that, in the abstract, I could make some better decisions being president than the current occupant, and believing that, in a very concrete way, being president was something I would pursue. I would say that it wasn't until I won my Senate primary and then went to the Democratic convention in 2004 that I had a sense that the message I was delivering might resonate with a broad cross section of the American people.

So it was that response at the Democratic conven­tion that year?
It wasn't just at the convention. We had gotten a pretty powerful response while I was running in the primary in Illinois. After I won, there was a real sense that people were eager to move beyond some of the old arguments.

When did you say, "I'm black, my name is this . . . what the fuck, I could do this."
I was never lacking in . . . Self-confidence? In confidence that my particular background would not be a barrier to me running.

Was there a moment during this primary pro­cess when you felt like you really hit your stride as a candidate?
In the last month in Iowa, you could feel things coming together. You could feel the message, the movement on the ground, all of it was starting to click. And one of the central premises of this cam­paign has always been that if we could get the voters excited about participating, we'd have a good chance. You could see that happening in December in Iowa.

That gave you the juice and the confidence?
Absolutely.

What part of the campaign have you enjoyed the most?
I love the town-hall meetings, where I'm just inter­acting with voters, and they're asking me questions and making comments. There's an exchange there that's real. I hear their stories . . . that actually is what then informs my speeches and the message that I'm delivering.

What have you learned in the campaign about America that you might not have known before?
I'm not sure if this is a new lesson, but it reinforced my belief that we're not as divided as our politics would indicate. You meet with the average person — I don't care whether they're Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal — they don't think in labels. They're not particularly ideological. Everybody is sort of a mix of what you might consider some liberal ideas, what you might consider some conservative ideas. But there is a set of common values that every-body buys into: Everybody thinks you should have to work hard for what you get, everybody believes that things like equal opportunity should be real, not just a slogan.

Are you surprised by how optimistic everyone is in their hearts?
The American people are, I think, congenitally op­timistic. Right now, they're not feeling particularly optimistic about Washington — they're genuinely con­cerned about the direction the country is moving in, they're anxious about globalization and whether we're going to be able to compete. But at bottom, they're not fatalists. They always feel like there's something we can do to make things better.

What have you learned about yourself during the campaign?
I've learned two things, and I think these two things are connected. One is that the older I get, the less important feeding my vanity becomes. I've dis­covered that I don't get a lot of satisfaction from being the center of attention, but I do get a lot of satisfaction about getting work done. And that, in turn, has led to a confirmation that I have a very steady temper. I don't get too high when things are high, I don't get too low when things are low, which has been very helpful during this campaign and is reflected in the people I hire and how we run our organization.

You've said you don't need to feed your vanity. How do you feed your sanity during the campaign?
Lately, because we've been campaigning in the Midwest, I get to go home each night. My nine-year-old is in the drama club, and last night they had a performance of Odysseus. It was outstanding. That's my unbiased review.

Three books that really inspired you.
Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon, the tragedies of William Shakespeare and probably Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.

You've gotten enormous support from the music community. Why do you think, they've responded so strongly to your campaign?
Musicians and creative folks, generally, may be in­clined toward the idea of change, or at least open to it — to not just settle for what is, but what might be.

When you were at the Rolling Stone cover shoot, they were playing the Grateful Dead, and you recog­nized the music right off.
Those guys did a concert for me during the primary — they got back together again. And not only do I enjoy the music, but I just like them as people.

Are we going to have a Deadhead in the White House? 
I'm not sure I fully qualify as a Deadhead — I don't wear tie-dye and I've never followed them around any­where. But I enjoy the songs.

You used "The Rising" by Bruce Springsteen a lot on the campaign. Who chose that? 
We go through a lot of things. We've gone through different phases. We had Aretha on there for a while, Stevie . . . always solid. "Rising" we felt just sort of cap­tured the spirit that we hope is in this campaign.

Bruce issued a pretty eloquent endorsement of you. What do you think of him and his work?
Not only do I love Bruce's music, but I just love him as a person. He is a guy who has never lost track of his roots, who knows who he is, who has never put on a front. When you think about authenticity, you think about Bruce Springsteen, and that's how he comes across personally. We actually haven't met in person.

He told me you gave him a call.
Yeah, we had a phone conversation, and he was exact­ly how you hoped he'd be. He's passionate and humble.

And you call him the Boss?
You've got to.

What did you listen to growing up?
I have pretty eclectic tastes. I grew up in the Seven­ties, so a lot of Seventies rhythm & blues and pop were staples for me: Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind and Fire, Elton John, Rolling Stones.

Is there anyone who you would say were musical he­roes to you at the time?
If I had one, it would have to be Stevie Wonder. When I was just at that point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie had that run with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness' First Finale and Innervisions, and then Songs in the Key of Life. Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we've ever seen. So that was a guy I loved, and I loved the Stones.

What's your favorite Stones stuff?
"Gimme Shelter" is a great song.

What are you listening to now? What's on your iPod?
When I was in high school, probably my sophomore or junior year, I started getting into jazz. So I've got a lot of Coltrane, a lot of Miles Davis, a lot of Charlie Parker. I've got all the artists we've already talked about, but I've got everything from Howlin' Wolf to Yo-Yo Ma to Sheryl Crow to Jay-Z.

What do you think of rap? Has it been unfairly attacked for destroying family values?
By definition, rock & roll is rebel music, which means if it's not being criticized, it's probably not do­ing its job. I am troubled sometimes by the misogyny and materialism of a lot of rap lyrics, but I think the genius of the art form has shifted the culture and helped to desegregate music. Music was very segregated back in the Seventies and Eighties — you'll remember that when MTV first came on, it wasn't until Thriller that they played Michael.

I know Jay-Z. I know Ludacris. I know Russell Sim­mons. I know a bunch of these guys. They are great talents and great businessmen, which is something that doesn't get emphasized enough. It would be nice if I could have my daughters listen to their music without me worrying that they were getting bad im­ages of themselves.

Overall, what do you thinly of pop cul­ture today? Is it a harmful or a healthy influence?
I'm not somebody who thinks that popular culture should carry the whole freight; it both shapes and reflects what's happening in the country as a whole. What I have seen is a shift in attitudes of young people wanting to be more engaged and more involved, and you're going to start seeing that increasingly reflected in music as well. Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks, and he's serious and he cares about his art. That's somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.

My sense is that artists go through phases. They start off expressing what they know and the stories they have to tell, and they're not necessarily thinking in terms of making a social statement. I don't think that should be a criteria for music. Over time, their worldviews broaden, and their music starts expressing that as well.

Change is the byword of the campaign and the definition of your strategy. Can you describe what change is? What does it look, like? Not in policy terms, but what change you want to bring to America as a whole. I want people to feel connected to their government again, and I want that government to respond to the voices of the people, and not just insiders and special interests. That's real change. I want us to think about the long term and not just the short term, whether it's climate change, energy policy, how we're educating our kids, what kind of investments we're making in our infrastructure, how we're dealing with the federal budget and national debt. I want us to think intergenerationally, something we used to do more of and we have lost. I want us to rediscover our bonds to each other and to get out of this constant petty bickering that's come to characterize our politics. That's not to say it's possible or even desirable to squash real policy arguments, but the tit-for-tat, "gotcha" game that passes for politics right now doesn't solve problems. I want to get beyond that.

All the young people who are backing you and who have placed such hope in you and your promise for change — what will change for them?
The sense that they can help shape the direction of this country. I always knew — partly because as some-body who has been a community organizer, I've helped mentor a lot of young people and talked to groups in­volved in public service— I always knew there was this real hunger to get engaged and involved on the part of young people, but they didn't see politics as an avenue to do it. What this campaign has done is said, "Even as you're organizing about Darfur, even as you're involved in that environmental group, even as you're joining Teach for America, there is a need for you to be part of this central conversation about our politics and our government." And they've responded.

How are you going to connect your support among young people to the governing process?
This is where the Internet is so powerful. One of the things that surprised me in this campaign is how well we were able to use technology to organize people. There's enormous promise — but we've just scratched the surface of what's possible when it comes to mak­ing government work for people. Virtual town-hall meetings, increasing transparency, accountability on legislation. You think about all the inefficiencies in gov­ernment. We basically have a New Deal government in a 21st-century economy. We've got to upgrade it.

So you're consciously aware that this will have to be part of how you govern?
Yes, absolutely. The Internet gives young people a tool to be informed continuously. It gives them an opportunity to speak to each other and mobilize themselves. It gives them the opportunity to hold me accountable when I'm not following through on prom­ises that I've made. It gives me a powerful ally if Con­gress is resistant to measures that need to be taken.

If you are president, what do you think will make the traditional Washington establishment most nervous about how you approach policy and government?
The relationship between lobbyists and legislation and the revolving door that's been created between people in government and K Street is not something you can eliminate, but it's something you can curb. People are going to be nervous about the fact that I'm interested in curbing it. Lobbyists have a function to play; they have a representing interest as part of our democracy. But the degree to which, during the Republican Congress, you literally had oil companies writing energy legislation or drug companies writing drug legislation, without regard for the public interest — that's got to change. And that will make some people uncomfortable, partly because it's very lucrative, and it's grown massively over the last decade. I don't think people understand . . .

The way legislation has been outsourced to private interests?
Yeah. I don't think people understand how much the lobbying industry has grown, and how much money is involved in it. A lot of people are getting paid handsomely. Would you say it's overtaken the elected represen­tatives themselves, in terms of their power to write legislation? I don't think it's overtaken the legislature, but I think that it has become an unhealthy symbiotic relationship. Last week, the Senate failed to pass a measure that would have strongly addressed global warming.

What's your plan to get meaningful climate-change legislation passed in the face of opposition by the oil, coal and auto industries and their allies in Congress?
Let's start with what we have to do. Every scientist that is serious about looking at this question will tell you that, at minimum, we've got to reduce carbon emis­sions by about 80 percent.

By what date?
2050. And it's not going to happen precipitously. We've got to start now and steadily ratchet down our carbon emissions.

Are you going to take the toughest of the policy approaches that have been proposed?
In order to actually get something passed, we're going to have to get the stakeholders involved and recognize, "Look, this is a painful process." These are tough guys with billions of dollars at stake. But look, the oil companies are still going to be making money. Here's my point: Whenever you transition to a new technology or a new way of thinking about structuring our economy, the old is going to resist the new. The key is to make the new profitable, job-generating and appealing enough that more and more people embrace the new and let go of the old. That's where government can play a role. If we institute a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions, that's going to generate billions of dollars. Now, that's also going to mean higher electricity prices for consumers, so a huge chunk of that has to go back to consumers in the form of rebates, so they don't feel the pinch as badly. That's point number one.

Point number two is we'll put $15 billion a year into alternative energy. We want to give encouragement to existing utilities, existing energy companies, to invest in solar and wind and biodiesel. When you have a guy like T. Boone Pickens, who made his money on oil, in­vesting in wind farms, that's how you can start getting the alignments to bring about change. On the other hand, if you think you're just going to shove this down their throats without any consideration for their economic interests— not just the big players but the workers who have jobs at risk or those who need to worry about their electricity bills — then people are going to be resistant.

You've been a big supporter of ethanol. But studies show it doesn't do anything to reduce global warming, it's actually a less efficient way to produce energy than gasoline, and it's contributing to growing food shortages worldwide. Are you going to continue to back it?
Corn-based ethanol I see as a transitional technol­ogy. We've got to invest in alternative fuels. This one is ranked as pretty bad. I understand, which is why we're going to have a transition from corn-based ethanol to cellulosic etha­nol, not using food crops as the source of energy.

So you foresee this coming to an end.
What I foresee is us transitioning into other ways of developing these energy sources. The fact that we had corn-based ethanol, and that industry has ma­tured, provides us with distribution networks and infrastructure that can ultimately be used for other ethanol sources.

In Dreams From My Father, you recount the big­otry your parents faced because of interracial marriage, which was illegal then. What is the difference between that and the current bans on gay marriage?
Well, I'm always careful not to draw easy equivalents between groups, because then you start getting into a contest about victimization or who has been discriminated against more. What I'll say is that I am a strong believer in civil unions that would provide all the federal rights under federal law that a marriage contract would provide to people. I think that the country is still working through the idea of same-sex marriage and its entanglement, histori­cally, with religious beliefs.

My sense is that a consensus has al­ready established itself that when it comes to hospital visitation, the ability to pass on benefits like Social Security, that people shouldn't be discriminated against, everyone should be treated equally. I think that is a starting point-that consensus is what will grow over time. If you want to use the analogy of the civil rights movement, Dr. King and others didn't lead with assaults on anti-miscegenation laws. They fo­cused on voting rights and civil rights. Once those rights were secured, the culture shifts.

The War on Drugs has cost taxpay­ers $500 billion since 1973. Nearly 500,000 people are behind bars on drug charges today, yet drugs are as avail­able as ever. Do you plan to continue the War on Drugs, or will you make some significant change in course?
Anybody who sees the devastating impact of the drug trade in the inner cities, or the methamphetamine trade in rural communities, knows that this is a huge problem. I believe in shifting the paradigm, shifting the model, so that we focus more on a public-health ap­proach. I can say this as an ex-smoker: We've made enormous progress in mak­ing smoking socially unacceptable. You think about auto safety and the huge success we've had in getting people to fasten their seat belts.

The point is that if we're putting more money into education, into treat­ment, into prevention and reducing the demand side, then the ways that we operate on the criminal side can shift. I would start with nonviolent, first-time drug offenders. The notion that we are imposing felonies on them or sending them to prison, where they are getting advanced degrees in criminality, instead of thinking about ways like drug courts that can get them back on track in their lives — it's expensive, it's counterpro­ductive, and it doesn't make sense.

What do you thinly went wrong with the Bush administration? How did things get so bad in these last eight years? What happened to us?
It's hard to know where to start. I think it starts with a president and a team that came in with a very ideologi­cal vision about what they wanted to accomplish. They said, "We are going to push through trillion-dollar tax cuts come hell or high water," without thinking through, "What does the country need right now? Are we falling behind in our investment in education? Are we failing to deal with our infrastructure? In the context of globalization, are we preparing citizens so they can access the global economy and succeed? Are we doing something to lessen growing in-equal ity?" Those weren't questions they were asking. They just had this idea, "We’re going to cut taxes massively, especially for our friends."

Then, because of a lack of curiosity about the world outside our borders, when 9/11 hit, the response again was ideological. There was an appropriate and pragmatic response when it came to going after the Taliban and Al Qaeda. But almost immediately, there was this sense of "Let's broaden our goal here to impose our will on the world as the lone superpower." And we have an admin­istration that doesn't listen and doesn't have a negative feedback loop that helps make midcourse corrections. As a con­sequence, we've got some big problems, both home and abroad.

Is there a marker you would lay down at the end of your first term where you say, "If this has happened or not happened, I would consider it a negative mark on my governance"?
If I haven't gotten combat troops out of Iraq, passed universal health care and created a new energy policy that speaks to our dependence on foreign oil and deals seriously with global warming, then we've missed the boat. Those are three big jobs, so it's going to require a lot of attention and imagination, and it's going to require the American people feeling inspired enough that they're pre­pared to take on these big challenges.

There is little doubt that you are going to be "Swift boated" in some way during the campaign and that we are all once again going to be hit with the politics of fear. How do you deal with that?
In the past, Democrats have cowered in front of that. Yeah, I don't do cowering. You have to respond forcefully, quickly and truthfully to attacks. So far, we've held up pretty well.

Do you think the American people have learned their lesson when it comes to that kind of attack?
One thing they know is we can't af­ford to be distracted right now. Look at the headlines in USA Today: In addition to floods, you've got “Gas Could Peak at $4.15” and “Credit Crisis Shortchanges Some Student-Loan Breaks.” People are having trouble making ends meet.

My point is that if I'm honest and straightforward and they trust me, these old tactics won't work.

Good luck. We are following you daily with great hope and admiration.
We're going to get this done

We arrived at the southwest gate of the white house a little after one o'clock on the afternoon of September 17th. It was a warm fall day, but the capital felt quiet and half-empty, as it does on Fridays at the end of summer, with Congress still in recess. Rolling Stone had interviewed Barack Obama twice before, both times aboard his campaign plane — first in June 2008, a few days after he won the Democratic nomination, and again that October, a month before his election. This time executive editor Eric Bates and I sat down with the president in the Oval Office, flanked by busts of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. The conversation stretched on for nearly an hour and a quarter. The president began by complimenting my multi-colored striped socks. "If I wasn't president," he laughed, "I could wear socks like that."

This article appeared in the October 14, 2010 issue of Rolling Stone. The issue is available in the online archive.

When you came into office, you felt you would be able to work with the other side. When did you realize that the Republicans had abandoned any real effort to work with you and create bipartisan policy? 
Well, I'll tell you that given the state of the economy during my transition, between my election and being sworn in, our working assumption was that everybody was going to want to pull together, because there was a sizable chance that we could have a financial meltdown and the entire country could plunge into a depression. So we had to work very rapidly to try to create a combination of measures that would stop the free-fall and cauterize the job loss.

The recovery package we shaped was put together on the theory that we shouldn't exclude any ideas on the basis of ideological predispositions, and so a third of the Recovery Act were tax cuts. Now, they happened to be the most progressive tax cuts in history, very much geared toward middle-class families. There was not only a fairness rationale to that, but also an economic rationale — those were the folks who were most likely to spend the money and, hence, prop up demand at a time when the economy was really freezing up.

I still remember going over to the Republican caucus to meet with them and present our ideas, and to solicit ideas from them before we presented the final package. And on the way over, the caucus essentially released a statement that said, "We're going to all vote 'No' as a caucus." And this was before we'd even had the conversation. At that point, we realized that we weren't going to get the kind of cooperation we'd anticipated. The strategy the Republicans were going to pursue was one of sitting on the sidelines, trying to gum up the works, based on the assumption that given the scope and size of the recovery, the economy probably wouldn't be very good, even in 2010, and that they were better off being able to assign the blame to us than work with us to try to solve the problem.

The Case for Obama

How do you feel about the fact that day after day, there's this really destructive attack on whatever you propose? Does that bother you? Has it shocked you? 
I don't think it's a shock. I had served in the United States Senate; I had seen how the filibuster had become a routine tool to slow things down, as opposed to what it used to be, which was a selective tool — although often a very destructive one, because it was typically targeted at civil rights and the aspirations of African-Americans who were trying to be freed up from Jim Crow. But I'd been in the Senate long enough to know that the machinery there was breaking down.

What I was surprised somewhat by, and disappointed by, although I've got to give some grudging admiration for just how effective it's been, was the degree to which [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell was able to keep his caucus together on a lot of issues. Eventually, we were able to wear them down, so that we were able to finally get really important laws passed, some of which haven't gotten a lot of attention — the credit-card reform bill, or the anti-tobacco legislation, or preventing housing and mortgage fraud. We'd be able to pick off two or three Republicans who wanted to do the right thing.

But the delays, the cloture votes, the unprecedented obstruction that has taken place in the Senate took its toll. Even if you eventually got something done, it would take so long and it would be so contentious, that it sent a message to the public that "Gosh, Obama said he was going to come in and change Washington, and it's exactly the same, it's more contentious than ever." Everything just seems to drag on — even what should be routine activities, like appointments, aren't happening. So it created an atmosphere in which a public that is already very skeptical of government, but was maybe feeling hopeful right after my election, felt deflated and sort of felt, "We're just seeing more of the same."

What do you think the Republican Party stands for today? 
Well, on the economic front, their only agenda seems to be tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. If you ask their leadership what their agenda will be going into next year to bring about growth and improve the job numbers out there, what they will say is, "We just want these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which will cost us $700 billion and which we're not going to pay for."

Now what they'll also say is, "We're going to control spending." But of course, when you say you're going to borrow $700 billion to give an average $100,000-a-year tax break to people making a million dollars a year, or more, and you're not going to pay for it; when Mitch McConnell's overall tax package that he just announced recently was priced at about $4 trillion; when you, as a caucus, reject a bipartisan idea for a fiscal commission that originated from Judd Gregg, Republican budget chair, and Kent Conrad, Democratic budget chair, so that I had to end up putting the thing together administratively because we couldn't get any support — you don't get a sense that they're actually serious on the deficit side.

What do you think of the Tea Party and the people behind it? 
I think the Tea Party is an amalgam, a mixed bag of a lot of different strains in American politics that have been there for a long time. There are some strong and sincere libertarians who are in the Tea Party who generally don't believe in government intervention in the market or socially. There are some social conservatives in the Tea Party who are rejecting me the same way they rejected Bill Clinton, the same way they would reject any Democratic president as being too liberal or too progressive. There are strains in the Tea Party that are troubled by what they saw as a series of instances in which the middle-class and working-class people have been abused or hurt by special interests and Washington, but their anger is misdirected.

And then there are probably some aspects of the Tea Party that are a little darker, that have to do with anti-immigrant sentiment or are troubled by what I represent as the president. So I think it's hard to characterize the Tea Party as a whole, and I think it's still defining itself.

Obama's Sheriff


Do you think that it's being manipulated? 
There's no doubt that the infrastructure and the financing of the Tea Party come from some very traditional, very powerful, special-interest lobbies. I don't think this is a secret. Dick Armey and FreedomWorks, which was one of the first organizational mechanisms to bring Tea Party folks together, are financed by very conservative industries and forces that are opposed to enforcement of environmental laws, that are opposed to an energy policy that would be different than the fossil-fuel-based approach we've been taking, that don't believe in regulations that protect workers from safety violations in the workplace, that want to make sure that we are not regulating the financial industries in ways that we have.

There's no doubt that there is genuine anger, frustration and anxiety in the public at large about the worst financial crisis we've experienced since the Great Depression. Part of what we have to keep in mind here is this recession is worse than the Ronald Reagan recession of the Eighties, the 1990-91 recession, and the 2001 recession combined. The depths of it have been profound. This body politic took a big hit in the gut, and that always roils up our politics, and can make people angry. But because of the ability of a lot of very well-funded groups to point that anger — I think misdirect that anger — it is translating into a relevant political force in this election.

What do you think of Fox News? Do you think it's a good institution for America and for democracy? 
[Laughs] Look, as president, I swore to uphold the Constitution, and part of that Constitution is a free press. We've got a tradition in this country of a press that oftentimes is opinionated. The golden age of an objective press was a pretty narrow span of time in our history. Before that, you had folks like Hearst who used their newspapers very intentionally to promote their viewpoints. I think Fox is part of that tradition — it is part of the tradition that has a very clear, undeniable point of view. It's a point of view that I disagree with. It's a point of view that I think is ultimately destructive for the long-term growth of a country that has a vibrant middle class and is competitive in the world. But as an economic enterprise, it's been wildly successful. And I suspect that if you ask Mr. Murdoch what his number-one concern is, it's that Fox is very successful.

You've passed more progressive legislation than any president since Lyndon Johnson. Yet your base does not seem nearly as fired up as the opposition, and you don't seem to be getting the credit for those legislative victories. There was talk that you were going to mobilize your grass-roots volunteers and use them to pressure Congress, but you decided for whatever reason not to involve the public directly and not to force a filibuster on issues like health care. What do you say to those people who have developed a sense of frustration — your base — who feel that you need to fight harder? 
That's a bunch of different questions, so let me see if I can kind of knock them out one by one.

One of the healthy things about the Democratic Party is that it is diverse and opinionated. We have big arguments within the party because we got a big tent, and that tent grew during my election and in the midterm election previously. So making everybody happy within the Democratic Party is always going to be tough.

Some of it, also, has to do with — and I joke about it — that there's a turn of mind among Democrats and progressives where a lot of times we see the glass as half-empty. It's like, "Well, gosh, we've got this historic health care legislation that we've been trying to get for 100 years, but it didn't have every bell and whistle that we wanted right now, so let's focus on what we didn't get instead of what we got." That self-critical element of the progressive mind is probably a healthy thing, but it can also be debilitating.

When I talk to Democrats around the country, I tell them, "Guys, wake up here. We have accomplished an incredible amount in the most adverse circumstances imaginable." I came in and had to prevent a Great Depression, restore the financial system so that it functions, and manage two wars. In the midst of all that, I ended one of those wars, at least in terms of combat operations. We passed historic health care legislation, historic financial regulatory reform and a huge number of legislative victories that people don't even notice. We wrestled away billions of dollars of profit that were going to the banks and middlemen through the student-loan program, and now we have tens of billions of dollars that are going directly to students to help them pay for college. We expanded national service more than we ever have before.

The Recovery Act alone represented the largest investment in research and development in our history, the largest investment in infrastructure since Dwight Eisenhower, the largest investment in education — and that was combined, by the way, with the kind of education reform that we hadn't seen in this country in 30 years — and the largest investment in clean energy in our history.

You look at all this, and you say, "Folks, that's what you elected me to do." I keep in my pocket a checklist of the promises I made during the campaign, and here I am, halfway through my first term, and we've probably accomplished 70 percent of the things that we said we were going to do — and by the way, I've got two years left to finish the rest of the list, at minimum. So I think that it is very important for Democrats to take pride in what we've accomplished.

All that has taken place against a backdrop in which, because of the financial crisis, we've seen an increase in poverty, and an increase in unemployment, and people's wages and incomes have stagnated. So it's not surprising that a lot of folks out there don't feel like these victories have had an impact. What is also true is our two biggest pieces of legislation, health care and financial regulatory reform, won't take effect right away, so ordinary folks won't see the impact of a lot of these things for another couple of years. It is very important for progressives to understand that just on the domestic side, we've accomplished a huge amount.

When you look at what we've been able to do internationally — resetting our relations with Russia and potentially having a new START treaty by the end of the year, reinvigorating the Middle East peace talks, ending the combat mission in Iraq, promoting a G-20 structure that has drained away a lot of the sense of north versus south, east versus west, so that now the whole world looks to America for leadership, and changing world opinion in terms of how we operate on issues like human rights and torture around the world — all those things have had an impact as well.

What is true, and this is part of what can frustrate folks, is that over the past 20 months, we made a series of decisions that were focused on governance, and sometimes there was a conflict between governance and politics. So there were some areas where we could have picked a fight with Republicans that might have gotten our base feeling good, but would have resulted in us not getting legislation done.

I could have had a knock-down, drag-out fight on the public option that might have energized you and The Huffington Post, and we would not have health care legislation now. I could have taken certain positions on aspects of the financial regulatory bill, where we got 90 percent of what we set out to get, and I could have held out for that last 10 percent, and we wouldn't have a bill. You've got to make a set of decisions in terms of "What are we trying to do here? Are we trying to just keep everybody ginned up for the next election, or at some point do you try to win elections because you're actually trying to govern?" I made a decision early on in my presidency that if I had an opportunity to do things that would make a difference for years to come, I'm going to go ahead and take it.

I just made the announcement about Elizabeth Warren setting up our Consumer Finance Protection Bureau out in the Rose Garden, right before you came in. Here's an agency that has the potential to save consumers billions of dollars over the next 20 to 30 years — simple stuff like making sure that folks don't jack up your credit cards without you knowing about it, making sure that mortgage companies don't steer you to higher-rate mortgages because they're getting a kickback, making sure that payday loans aren't preying on poor people in ways that these folks don't understand. And you know what? That's what we say we stand for as progressives. If we can't take pleasure and satisfaction in concretely helping middle-class families and working-class families save money, get a college education, get health care — if that's not what we're about, then we shouldn't be in the business of politics. Then we're no better than the other side, because all we're thinking about is whether or not we're in power.

Let me ask you about financial reform. Despite all the things like consumer protection that you did get accomplished, the regulation of Wall Street — especially the closing down of all the derivatives trading that was really at the heart of the financial meltdown — seems to have been eviscerated. 
I've got to disagree with that. If you take a look at it, what we've essentially said is that the vast majority of derivatives are now going to be sold through a clearinghouse. And if you ask the experts what was the best way to make sure the derivative markets didn't bring down the economy again, it's transparency, so that everybody understands who the counterparties are, everybody understands what the deal is, what the risks are — it's all aboveboard, it's all in the light of day.

People have legitimate concerns that if the rules drafted by all these various agencies in charge of implementing financial reform wind up with exceptions that are so big you can drive a truck through them, and suddenly you can have these specially tailored derivatives that are sold outside of the clearinghouse, then you could end up with an inadequate regulatory structure.

But if the rules are written properly — and I have confidence that the people I appointed to these agencies intend to apply them properly — it’s going to make a difference. Is it going to solve every potential problem in Wall Street in a multi-trillion-dollar, worldwide, capital market? Probably not. There could end up being new schemes, new loopholes that folks are going to try to exploit. The special interests are already ginning up to try to influence the rulemaking process in all these issues, so we have to remain vigilant. But to say that we did not significantly improve oversight of the derivatives market, it just isn’t true.


There’s also a concern when it comes to financial reform that your economic team is closely identified with Wall Street and the deregulation that caused the collapse. These are the folks who were supposed to have had oversight of Wall Street, and many of them worked for or were close to banks like Goldman Sachs. 
Let me first of all say this. . . .

You used to work for Goldman Sachs! 
[Laughs] Exactly. I read some of the articles that Tim Dickinson and others have produced in Rolling Stone. I understand the point of view that they're bringing. But look: Tim Geithner never worked for Goldman; Larry Summers didn't work for Goldman. There is no doubt that I brought in a bunch of folks who understand the financial markets, the same way, by the way, that FDR brought in a lot of folks who understood the financial markets after the crash, including Joe Kennedy, because my number-one job at that point was making sure that we did not have a full-fledged financial meltdown.

The reason that was so important was not because I was concerned about making sure that the folks who had been making hundreds of millions of dollars were keeping their bonuses for the next year. The reason was because we were seeing 750,000 jobs a month being lost when I was sworn in. The consequence to Main Street, to ordinary folks, was catastrophic, and we had to make sure that we stopped the bleeding. We managed to stabilize the financial markets at a cost that is much less to taxpayers than anybody had anticipated. The truth of the matter is that TARP will end up costing probably less than $100 billion, when all is said and done. Which I promise you, two years ago, you could have asked any economist and any financial expert out there, and they would have said, "We'll take that deal."

One of the things that you realize when you're in my seat is that, typically, the issues that come to my desk — there are no simple answers to them. Usually what I'm doing is operating on the basis of a bunch of probabilities: I'm looking at the best options available based on the fact that there are no easy choices. If there were easy choices, somebody else would have solved it, and it wouldn't have come to my desk.

That's true for financial regulatory reform, that's true on Afghanistan, that's true on how we deal with the terrorist threat. On all these issues, you've got a huge number of complex factors involved. When you're sitting outside and watching, you think, "Well, that sounds simple," and you can afford to operate on the basis of your ideological predispositions. What I'm trying to do — and certainly what we've tried to do in our economic team — is to keep a North Star out there: What are the core principles we're abiding by? In the economic sphere, my core principle is that America works best when you've got a growing middle class, and you've got ladders so that people who aren't yet in the middle class can aspire to the middle class, and if that broad base is rolling, then the country does well.

How do you personally feel about hedge-fund managers who are making $200 million a year and paying a 15 percent tax rate? Or the guy who made $700 million one year and compared you to Hitler for trying to raise his taxes above 15 percent — does that gall you? 
I've gotta say that I have been surprised by some of the rhetoric in the business press, in which we are accused of being anti-business. I know a lot of these guys who started hedge funds. They are making large profits, taking home large incomes, but because of a rule called "carried interest," they are paying lower tax rates than their secretaries, or the janitor that cleans up the building. Or folks who are out there as police officers and teachers and small-business people. So all we've said is that it makes sense for them to pay taxes on it like on ordinary income.

I understand why folks might disagree with that. I've yet to meet a broad base of people who are anxious to pay higher taxes. But the point you're making, which is exactly right, is that what should be a pretty straightforward policy argument ends up generating the kind of rhetoric we've been seeing: where I'm anti-business, I'm socialist, our administration is trying to destroy capitalism. That, I think, is over-the-top.

The average American out there who is my primary concern and is making 60 grand a year and paying taxes on all that income and trying to send their kids through school, and partly as a consequence of bad decisions on Wall Street, feels that their job is insecure and has seen their 401(k) decline by 30 percent, and has seen the value of their home decline — I don't think they're that sympathetic to these guys, and neither am I.

Let's talk about the war in Afghanistan. Where were you when you first heard about the comments made by Gen. Stanley McChrystal and his staff, and how did you feel as you read them for yourself? 
I was in my office in the residence, in the Treaty Room. Joe Biden called me — he was the first one who heard about it. I think it was Sunday night, and I had one of the staff here send me up a copy, and I read through the article. I will say at the outset that I think Gen. McChrystal is a fine man, an outstanding soldier, and has served this country very well. I do not think that he meant those comments maliciously. I think some of those comments were from his staff, and so he was poorly served. And it pained me to have to make the decision I did. Having said that, he showed bad judgment. When I put somebody in charge of the lives of 100,000 young men and women in a very hazardous situation, they've got to conduct themselves at the highest standards, and he didn't meet those standards.


But it couldn't have just been those remarks, which were casual and forgivable. The whole article was pretty damning. 
The remarks themselves, I think, showed poor judgment. The rest of the article had to do with a series of very difficult, complex choices on the ground in Afghanistan, in which, as I said before, there are no easy answers. So Gen. McChrystal, in response to a very serious and legitimate concern about civilian casualties in Afghanistan, put out orders that have significantly reduced civilian casualties. The flip side of it is that it frustrates our troops, who feel that they may not be able to go on the offense as effectively, and it may put them in danger. That's a profound strategic, tactical debate that takes place in the military. That's not unique to Gen. McChrystal — that's a debate that Gen. Petraeus is having to work his way through, that's a debate that I have to work my way through as commander in chief.

To broaden the issue for a second, you were asking about the sources of frustration in the progressive community; clearly, Afghanistan has to be near the top of the list, maybe at the top of the list. I always try to point out, number one, that this shouldn't have come as any surprise. When I was campaigning, I was very specific. I said, "We are going to end the war in Iraq, that was a mistake," and I have done that. What I also said was that we need to plus up what we're doing in Afghanistan, because that was where the original terrorist threat emanated, and we need to finish the job. That's what we're doing.

Now, I think that a lot of progressive supporters thought that maybe it would be easier than it has proven to be to try to bring Afghanistan to a place where we can see an end in sight. The fact of the matter is, when we came in, what we learned was that the neglect of Afghanistan had been more profound than we expected. Just simple examples: The Afghan National Army, the Afghan security forces, oftentimes were recruited, given a uniform, given a rifle, and that was it — they weren't getting trained. As a functional matter, there was no way that they were going to start taking the place of U.S. troops.

What we've had to do after an extensive review that I engaged in was to say to our commanders on the ground, "You guys have to have a strategy in which we are training Afghan security forces, we're going to break the Taliban momentum, but I am going to establish a date at which we start transitioning down and we start turning these security functions over to a newly trained Afghan security force." That is what we're in the process of doing.

It is exacting a terrible cost. Whenever I go over to Walter Reed or Bethesda, or when I was in Afghanistan, and I meet kids who lost their legs or were otherwise badly injured, I am reminded of that cost. Nobody wants more than me to be able to bring that war to a close in a way that makes sure that region is not used as a base for terrorist attacks against the United States. But what we have to do is see this process through. Starting July of 2011, we will begin a transition process, and if the strategy we're engaged in isn't working, we're going to keep on re-examining it until we make sure that we've got a strategy that does work.

But by every index we know of, there seems to be no part of the Afghanistan strategy that is working. The Taliban control more of the country than ever. The Karzai regime is incredibly corrupt and has lost the trust of its own people. The program to buy the loyalty of Taliban soldiers, which was used with the Awakening during the surge in Iraq, can't find enough takers for the $250 million that was allocated to it. The McChrystal offensive in Kandahar also failed. Afghanistan has been called the "graveyard of empires." In view of the fact that Great Britain failed there, the Soviet Union with millions of troops right on the border failed there — what makes you think we are going to succeed? 
Number one, this is very hard stuff. I knew it was hard a year ago, and I suspect a year from now, I will conclude that it's still hard, and it's messy. Number two, when you tick off these metrics that have quote-unquote "failed" — well, they haven't failed yet. They haven't succeeded yet. We've made progress in terms of creating a line of security around Kandahar, but there's no doubt that Kandahar is not yet a secure place any more than Mosul or Fallujah were secure in certain phases of the Iraq War.

I will also agree that Afghanistan is harder than Iraq. This is the second-poorest country in the world. You've got no tradition of a civil service or bureaucracy that is effective countrywide. We have been very successful in taking out the middle ranks of the Taliban. We have been very successful in recruiting and beginning to train Afghan security forces. There are elements that are working, and there are elements that are not working.

Keep in mind that the decision I have to make is always, "If we're not doing this, then what does that mean? What are the consequences?" I don't know anybody who has examined the region who thinks that if we completely pulled out of Afghanistan, the Karzai regime collapsed, Kabul was overrun once again by the Taliban, and Sharia law was imposed throughout the country, that we would be safer, or the Afghan people would be better off, or Pakistan would be better off, or India would be better off, or that we would see a reduction in potential terrorist attacks around the world. You can't make that argument.

Some have argued that what we can do is have a smaller footprint in Afghanistan, focus on counterterrorism activities, but have less boots on the ground. We examined every option that's out there. I assure you: With all the problems we've got here at home, and the fact that I have to sign letters to the family members of every soldier who is killed in Afghanistan, if I can find a way of reducing the costs to the American taxpayer, and more profoundly, to our young men and women in uniform, while making sure that we are not rendered much more vulnerable to a terrorist attack in the future, that's going to be the option that I choose. But no matter what your ultimate belief is in terms of what will succeed in Afghanistan, it's going to take us several years to work through this issue.

Ideally, what would have happened was that we didn't go into Iraq. Right after our victory in 2001, if we had focused on rebuilding Afghanistan, and had been in much more direct day-to-day interaction with Karzai and his government, then we wouldn't find ourselves in this circumstance.

But you know what: I have to play the cards that I'm dealt. In an ideal world, I wouldn't have inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit and the worst recession since the Great Depression. But you work with what's before you.


Let me ask you about the Gulf oil spill. British Petroleum fired Tony Hayward, so my question is: Why does Interior Secretary Ken Salazar still have his job? The corruption at Minerals Management Service was widely known at the time he came into office, as was reported several times in Rolling Stone and other places, and that's what helped the Gulf disaster to happen. 
When Ken Salazar came in, he said to me, "One of my top priorities is cleaning up MMS." It was no secret. You had seen the kind of behavior in that office that was just over-the-top, and Ken did reform the agency to eliminate those core ethical lapses — the drugs, the other malfeasance that was reported there. What Ken would admit, and I would admit, and what we both have to take responsibility for, is that we did not fully change the institutional conflicts that were inherent in that office. If you ask why did we not get that done, the very simple answer is that this is a big government with a lot of people, and changing bureaucracies and agencies is a time-consuming process. We just didn't get to it fast enough.

Having said that, the person who was put in charge of MMS was fired. We brought in Michael Bromwich, who by every account is somebody who is serious about cleaning up that agency. We are committed to making sure that that place works the way it is supposed to. But when I have somebody like Ken Salazar, who has been an outstanding public servant, who takes this stuff seriously, who bleeds when he sees what was happening in the Gulf, and had started on a path of reform but just didn't get there as fast on every aspect of it as needed to be, I had to just let him know, "You're accountable, you're responsible, I expect you to change it." I have confidence that he can change it, and I think he's in the process of doing so.

James Hansen, the NASA scientist who is perhaps the most respected authority on global warming, says that climate change is the predominant moral issue of the 21st century, comparable to slavery faced by Lincoln and the response to Nazism faced by Churchill. Do you agree with that statement? 
What I would agree with is that climate change has the potential to have devastating effects on people around the globe, and we've got to do something about it. In order to do something about it, we're going to have to mobilize domestically, and we're going to have to mobilize internationally.

During the past two years, we've not made as much progress as I wanted to make when I was sworn into office. It is very hard to make progress on these issues in the midst of a huge economic crisis, because the natural inclination around the world is to say, "You know what? That may be a huge problem, but right now what's a really big problem is 10 percent unemployment," or "What's a really big problem is that our businesses can't get loans." That diverted attention from what I consider to be an urgent priority. The House of Representatives made an attempt to deal with the issue in a serious way. It wasn't perfect, but it was serious. We could not get 60 votes for a comparable approach in the Senate.

One of my top priorities next year is to have an energy policy that begins to address all facets of our overreliance on fossil fuels. We may end up having to do it in chunks, as opposed to some sort of comprehensive omnibus legislation. But we're going to stay on this because it is good for our economy, it's good for our national security, and, ultimately, it's good for our environment.

Understand, though, that even in the absence of legislation, we took steps over the past two years that have made a significant difference. I will give you one example, and this is an example where sometimes I think the progressive community just pockets whatever we do, takes it for granted, and then asks, "Well, why didn't you get this done?"

We instituted the first increase in fuel-efficiency standards in this country in 30 years. It used to be that California would have some very rigorous rule, and then other states would have much weaker ones. Now we've got one rule. Not only that, it used to be that trucks weren't covered, and there were all kinds of loopholes — that's how SUVs were out there getting eight miles a gallon. Now everybody's regulated — not only cars, but trucks. We did this with the agreement of the auto industry, which had never agreed to it before, we did it with the auto workers, who had never agreed to it before. We are taking the equivalent of millions of cars off the road, when it comes to the amount of greenhouse gases that are produced.

Is it enough? Absolutely not. The progress that we're making on renewable energy, the progress that we're making on retrofitting buildings and making sure that we are reducing electricity use — all those things, cumulatively, if we stay on it over the next several years, will allow us to meet the target that I set, which would be around a 17 percent reduction in our greenhouse gases.

But we're going to have to do a lot more than that. When I talk to [Energy Secretary] Steven Chu, who, by the way, was an unsung hero in the Gulf oil spill — this guy went down and helped design the way to plug that hole with BP engineers — nobody's a bigger champion for the cause of reducing climate change than he is. When I ask him how we are going to solve this problem internationally, what he'll tell you is that we can get about a third of this done through efficiencies and existing technologies, we can get an additional chunk through some sort of pricing in carbon, but ultimately we're going to need some technological breakthroughs. So the investments we're making in research and development around clean energy are also going to be important if we're going to be able to get all the way there. Am I satisfied with what we've gotten done? Absolutely not.


Do you see a point at which you're going to throw the whole weight of the presidency behind this, like you did on health care or financial reform? 
Yes. Not only can I foresee it, but I am committed to making sure that we get an energy policy that makes sense for the country and that helps us grow at the same time as it deals with climate change in a serious way. I am just as committed to getting immigration reform done.

I've been here two years, guys. And one of the things that I just try to remember is that if we have accomplished 70 percent of what we committed to in the campaign, historic legislation, and we've got 30 percent of it undone — well, that's what the next two years is for, or maybe the next six.

Understandably, everybody has a great sense of urgency about these issues. But one of the things that I constantly want to counsel my friends is to keep the long view in mind. On social issues, something like "don't ask, don't tell." Here, I've got the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff both committed to changing the policy. That's a big deal.

You get credit for that. 
Now, I am also the commander in chief of an armed forces that is in the midst of one war and wrapping up another one. So I don't think it's too much to ask, to say "Let's do this in an orderly way" — to ensure, by the way, that gays and lesbians who are serving honorably in our armed forces aren't subject to harassment and bullying and a whole bunch of other stuff once we implement the policy. I use that as an example because on each of these areas, even those where we did not get some grand legislative victory, we have made progress. We have moved in the right direction.

When people start being concerned about, "You haven't closed Guantánamo yet," I say, listen, that's something I wanted to get done by now, and I haven't gotten done because of recalcitrance from the other side. Frankly, it's an easy issue to demagogue. But what I have been able to do is to ban torture. I have been able to make sure that our intelligence agencies and our military operate under a core set of principles and rules that are true to our traditions of due process. People will say, "I don't know — you've got your Justice Department out there that's still using the state-secrets doctrine to defend against some of these previous actions." Well, I gave very specific instructions to the Department of Justice. What I've said is that we are not going to use a shroud of secrecy to excuse illegal behavior on our part. On the other hand, there are occasions where I've got to protect operatives in the field, their sources and their methods, because if those were revealed in open court, they could be subject to very great danger. There are going to be circumstances in which, yes, I can't have every operation that we're engaged in to deal with a very real terrorist threat published in Rolling Stone.

These things don't happen overnight. But we're moving in the right direction, and that's what people have to keep in mind.

What has surprised you the most about these first two years in office? What advice would you give your successor about the first two years? 
Over the past two years, what I probably anticipated but you don't fully appreciate until you're in the job, is something I said earlier, which is if a problem is easy, it doesn't hit my desk. If there's an obvious solution, it never arrives here — somebody else has solved it a long time ago. The issues that cross my desk are hard and complicated, and oftentimes involve the clash not of right and wrong, but of two rights. And you're having to balance and reconcile against competing values that are equally legitimate.

What I'm very proud of is that we have, as an administration, kept our moral compass, even as we've worked through these very difficult issues. Doesn't mean we haven't made mistakes, but I think we've moved the country in a profoundly better direction just in the past two years.


What music have you been listening to lately? What have you discovered, what speaks to you these days? 
My iPod now has about 2,000 songs, and it is a source of great pleasure to me. I am probably still more heavily weighted toward the music of my childhood than I am the new stuff. There's still a lot of Stevie Wonder, a lot of Bob Dylan, a lot of Rolling Stones, a lot of R&B, a lot of Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Those are the old standards.

A lot of classical music. I'm not a big opera buff in terms of going to opera, but there are days where Maria Callas is exactly what I need.

Thanks to Reggie [Love, the president's personal aide], my rap palate has greatly improved. Jay-Z used to be sort of what predominated, but now I've got a little Nas and a little Lil Wayne and some other stuff, but I would not claim to be an expert. Malia and Sasha are now getting old enough to where they start hipping me to things. Music is still a great source of joy and occasional solace in the midst of what can be some difficult days.

[asset]

You had Bob Dylan here. How did that go? 
Here's what I love about Dylan: He was exactly as you'd expect he would be. He wouldn't come to the rehearsal; usually, all these guys are practicing before the set in the evening. He didn't want to take a picture with me; usually all the talent is dying to take a picture with me and Michelle before the show, but he didn't show up to that. He came in and played "The Times They Are A-Changin'." A beautiful rendition. The guy is so steeped in this stuff that he can just come up with some new arrangement, and the song sounds completely different. Finishes the song, steps off the stage — I'm sitting right in the front row — comes up, shakes my hand, sort of tips his head, gives me just a little grin, and then leaves. And that was it — then he left. That was our only interaction with him. And I thought: That's how you want Bob Dylan, right? You don't want him to be all cheesin' and grinnin' with you. You want him to be a little skeptical about the whole enterprise. So that was a real treat.

Having Paul McCartney here was also incredible. He's just a very gracious guy. When he was up there singing "Michelle" to Michelle, I was thinking to myself, "Imagine when Michelle was growing up, this little girl on the South Side of Chicago, from a working-class family." The notion that someday one of the Beatles would be singing his song to her in the White House — you couldn't imagine something like that.

Did you cry? 
Whenever I think about my wife, she can choke me up. My wife and my kids, they'll get to me.

[Signaled by his aides, the president brings the interview to a close and leaves the Oval Office. A moment later, however, he returns to the office and says that he has one more thing to add. He speaks with intensity and passion, repeatedly stabbing the air with his finger.]

One closing remark that I want to make: It is inexcusable for any Democrat or progressive right now to stand on the sidelines in this midterm election. There may be complaints about us not having gotten certain things done, not fast enough, making certain legislative compromises. But right now, we've got a choice between a Republican Party that has moved to the right of George Bush and is looking to lock in the same policies that got us into these disasters in the first place, versus an administration that, with some admitted warts, has been the most successful administration in a generation in moving progressive agendas forward.

The idea that we've got a lack of enthusiasm in the Democratic base, that people are sitting on their hands complaining, is just irresponsible.

Everybody out there has to be thinking about what's at stake in this election and if they want to move forward over the next two years or six years or 10 years on key issues like climate change, key issues like how we restore a sense of equity and optimism to middle-class families who have seen their incomes decline by five percent over the last decade. If we want the kind of country that respects civil rights and civil liberties, we'd better fight in this election. And right now, we are getting outspent eight to one by these 527s that the Roberts court says can spend with impunity without disclosing where their money's coming from. In every single one of these congressional districts, you are seeing these independent organizations outspend political parties and the candidates by, as I said, factors of four to one, five to one, eight to one, 10 to one.

We have to get folks off the sidelines. People need to shake off this lethargy, people need to buck up. Bringing about change is hard — that's what I said during the campaign. It has been hard, and we've got some lumps to show for it. But if people now want to take their ball and go home, that tells me folks weren't serious in the first place.



Cream is good at a number of things; unfortunately song-writing and recording are not among them. However, they are fantastic performers and excellent musicians. Their latest recording, Wheels of Fire, a two-record set inside a silver jacket, proves all this.

One record is subtitled "In the Studio." The set begins with a Jack Bruce original, "White Room," which is practically an exact duplication of "Tales of Brave Ulysses" from their Disraeli Gears album, including the exact same lines for guitar, bass and drums. The lyrics are not much to speak of and it's very difficult to imagine why they would want to do this again, unless of course, they had forgotten that they had done it before. The Sonny Bono-ish production job adds little.

"Sittin' On Top of the World," a Howlin' Wolf song, is a fine slow blues, done much closer to the original than the familiar speeded-up version by the Grateful Dead. The song is a good vehicle for Clapton, but that's about it. Wolf's ballad-style singing and melody is far superior to Bruce's. (Those interested in comparisons might want to pick up Wolf's Real Folk Blues LP on the Chess label, and compare the two, and then compare that comparison to what the Electric Flag did with Wolf's "Killing Floor," also on the same record. The Flag wins.)

"Passing the Time," a soft sad-circus tune with various instrumental paraphernalia thrown in, is a stone bore. The transition from verse to chorus is absolutely absurd. Ginger Baker stands out on glockenspiel. Of all of Jack Bruce's compositions in this release, only one of them is good, "As You Said." The structure is thoughtful and pleasant. Clapton is totally absent from this cut; Ginger Baker uses only his high hat and Bruce plays acoustic guitar and cello. The way they play back and forth and with each other, each on the melody together, is musicianship worthy of their reputation.

"Pressed Rat and Warthog," a Ginger Baker poem recited to a good background of drum rolls and Clapton's chording, is a track open to individual taste. It's nice, but not what you want to get the album for. The trumpet solos spoil whatever mood was trying to be evoked by their superfluous ness and obviousness.

It is unfortunate that the group chose to do "Born Under a Bad Sign," that fine blues that Booker T. Jones wrote for Albert King. King's guitar solo can hardly be improved, although Clapton does do it with his own style. The real mistake is that Jack Bruce doesn't have a good voice for blues, but he chooses to try it out on one that is currently popular in an exceptionally fine original version. His throaty breathing is just plain wrong. Ginger Baker also ought to learn that knocking on a cowbell and woodblock does not make a song funky.

There is really only one good side to come out of the studio, and that is "Politician," a track which really gets to the heart of Cream's very real problem. Because only rarely do they have a good original song to work with, their standard procedure is to put a strong rhythm and chord structure behind it and sort of recite the lyrics, spoken almost rather than sung because there is no melody. The trouble with this studio LP is that confronted with this problem — and their predilection to use miserable originals rather than revive a good blues — they have chosen to add layers of superfluous instrumental work. This is particularly ironic in that Cream is the group that initiated the concept of a trio with only the three essential instruments really commanding a piece.

What makes "Politician" the most successful is that, although it is not a song of much merit, they don't muddy it with a lot of meaningless studio garbage, but use the studio to overdub two more guitar parts. In "Those Were the Days," half of it is studio garbage and the other half is the driving drum-bass-guitar combination.

Disraeli Gears had this same problem of paucity of material. In that previous release they had three good originals, used a few good blues, and for the rest of it wailed with only three instruments, so that despite the lack of good original material, it was still fine listening. It took only four days to do Disraeli Gears "from stem to stern," as their producer, Felix Pappalardi, has put it, and several weeks for the studio work in their new release. Disraeli Gears was far better.

Fortunately, however, the other record in this set is "Live At The Fill-more" where it was recorded several months ago. For one thing, it at least proves that you can do an excellent live recording of a rock and roll group (something, amazingly enough, none of the San Francisco groups have yet done, despite the popular belief that their sound is designed for live performances).

By and large, the live performance is excellent. Jack Bruce is not very good with a harmonica and it amazes me why he plays it at all. His solo on "Traintime" is loudly amateurish. If they had dumped this cut and put in three of the studio sides ("Sittin' On Top of the World," "As You Said," and "Politician"), we would have one really fine record instead of a set that is 1¾ good and 2¼ mediocre.

"Toad" is a fine number; the live performance is much better than the previously recorded studio version. Here Clapton really displays his superlative chording and rhythm abilities. Ginger Baker's long drum solo is pretty good, on the whole. His tendency to be sloppy is not evident, and he gets moving quickly and sustains the tension well (though he nearly loses it once when he seems to have momentarily choked and come out of it with a few repetitive minutes).

The really fine side of this whole business is the one with "Crossroads" and "Spoonful." This is where Cream really shines because it is where they are at: live, without superfluity of any kind, and into the blues. Clapton is a much better blues singer than Bruce, and his vocal on "Crossroads" is a relief. The tune is Clapton's showpiece, and he does it just like he's supposed to. It's far and away the best cut on the album.

"Spoonful" only really gets going about a third of the way into it. The only criticism I have about this cut is that Jack Bruce's bass-playing is much too busy when he should be the bottom of the sound. On the other hand, he and Clapton really move. The way they do it as a trio is excellent: Clapton and Bruce get going into their "rolling and tumbling" groove, making it madly through the record while Ginger Baker is playing vertically, walking along at just as mad a clip. This is the kind of thing that people who have seen Cream perform walk away raving about and it's good to at last have it on a record.

Anyway, the whole bundle comes in a double-fold packet with this exploding, psychedelicized imitation Saul Steinberg (of the New Yorker) cartoon mural on the cover and a totally tasteless Ken Kesey-ism on the inside.

The album will be a monster.

The Crown Prince of Soul is dead.

Otis Redding, 26 years old, a former well-driller from Macon, Georgia, died in a plane crash in an icy Wisconsin lake on December 10. With him were the five teen-age members of the Bar-Kays, a group which made the popular instrumental, "Soul Finger," and who backed Otis on his recent tours and appearances.

Otis was headed from Cleveland, Ohio, to a Sunday evening concert in Madison, Wisconsin. It was his first tour in the private plane he had just purchased. His plane hit the surface of the fog-shrouded lake with tremendous force, widely scattering the debris. He was only four miles from the Madison Municipal Airport. On Tuesday, teams of divers were still dredging the bottom of the lake in a search for the bodies.

The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time: Otis Redding

Redding's singing career began when he won fifteen straight Sunday night talent shows in Macon. One day he drove with a friend of his to Memphis for a recording session, cut two sides himself and was immediately a major talent. Among the many songs he was responsible for were "Pain in My Heart," done in a later version by some of his greatest admirers, the Rolling Stones; "Mr. Pitiful," a song so popular on the rhythm and blues charts that for a long time he was known as Mr. Pitiful; "That's How Strong My Love Is," another song which was picked up by the Rolling Stones.

Among the others, Otis' great recordings included "Shake," a Sam Cooke song with which he broke up the Monterey Pop Festival; "I've Been Loving You Too Long," and "Try A Little Tenderness," soul ballads which he made so effective by singing the tenderest lines against driving uptempo beats. Another great Otis ballad was "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa," also known as "Sad Song." The song he did which sold the biggest was his version of the Stones' "Satisfaction," which broke on many white charts as well as R&B surveys.

In terms of conventional success, Otis never made it into the top twenty of the national pop charts; others had much greater success with his material. Aretha Franklin pulled off a million seller with one of Otis' favoirte original compositions, "Respect." Arthur Conley also made number one, with "Sweet Soul Music," a song Otis wrote and produced.

In 1967 he replaced Elvis Presley as the world's top male vocalist in the Melody Maker poll, a position Presley had held for eight years.

The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time: Otis Redding

In 1967 he proved himself to be a master of production (he had a studio at his 300-acre ranch outside of Macon) and a writer whose material was not only suited to himself but to the entire medium. His voice was rough, but it carried with it a style and a grace and an originality that was rare in the field of rhythm and blues, rock and roll, rock and soul or whatever it's called. Otis was a man of music.

1967 was the year that the Stax-Volt operation at Memphis replaced the Motown group in Detroit as the major influence on contemporary blues. Stax-Volt is a tightly knit group of writers, performers and musicians. (Otis wrote "Mr. Pitiful" and "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa" with Steve Cropper, who also collaborated on "Midnight Hour," and Cropper is the guitarist with Booker T. and the M.G.'s, the Stax-Volt house band, the band which backed Otis at the Monterey.)

The Memphis sound was going to take over soul in 1968. Everyone knew it, and Otis was the front man at Stax. In 1968, he was going to become "the King of them all, y'all."

Otis was the Crown Prince of Soul, and now the Crown Prince is dead.

his is the third full-length Rolling Stone interview with Bill Clinton. We first met in 1992 at Doe's Eat Place, a steak joint in Little Rock, Arkansas, when he was fresh from winning his party's presidential nomination. A year and a half later, we sat around a table in a private dining room off the Oval Office while the energetic young president discoursed at length on the challenges of occupying the most powerful office in the world.

This final interview — the longest of the three — began in the family quarters in the White House on a beautiful fall day in October and concluded just four days before Election Day, aboard Air Force One, en route to a last-minute campaign appearance in California. We had been promised a quick third session for a postelection wrap-up, but with the Florida vote still up in the air, the president chose not to comment. As we went to press, we still did not know who would succeed him, but we preserved his predictions in this interview, for the record.

The president we encountered this time seemed more humble but also more confident and expansive. No longer just the brightest and most energetic guy in the room, Bill Clinton gracefully exudes the dignity and command of the presidency. On the first day we met, we were sandwiched into his typically furious schedule. In the morning, he had received the leader of the North Korean army — the first presidential contact with an official from that country in fifty years; later, the president would preside over a bipartisan ceremony on the South Lawn to sign the bill normalizing trade relations with China. The president has also been spending late nights dealing with the violence that has broken out in the Middle East in the wake of the collapsed Camp David talks.

Journalists rarely enter the family quarters of the White House. We were invited to conduct the first part of the interview in the solarium, the glassed-in oval room on the third floor that has traditionally been the president's family room, with its inspiring view of the Washington Monument. On one table sits a large collection of Russian dolls painted as Hillary, Bill or Chelsea. A Peter Max lithograph hangs on one wall, as does a beautiful painting of a leopard, a gift from South African President Nelson Mandela. There is also a collection of Beanie Babies for the Clintons' nephews. A passageway leading into the room has been decorated with photographs depicting the Clintons' 30 years in public life. Just down the hall, the president has set up a small music room, where he keeps his saxophones. Naturally, there is a portrait of Elvis on the wall.

When the president enters, he sits down at the small glass-topped dining table, picks up a cigar and cuts off the end but does not light it.

How are you feeling? You must be exhausted. 
I was up all night talking to [Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak]. I slept an hour, and then another thirty or forty minutes in different snippets — I'd just fall asleep. Today I feel pretty good, because the violence has gone down considerably.

What are you doing from here? 
I've spent so much time with both of them, so I know quite a bit about what makes them tick. I understand the pressures they're both under and how they both came to see themselves and their people as victims in this.

Were you shocked by what happened? 
I was surprised it spread as quickly as it did, that the feelings on both sides could be stripped to the core so quickly, because they've made so much progress and gotten so close. But in a funny way, Camp David made the Israelis feel even more vulnerable. Barak went further, by far, than any Israeli prime minister had gone before.

They made more progress at Camp David on the security issues than anything else — because it was the most concrete, with the fewest number of unpredictable consequences in the future. They also had a habit of working together on security and getting along. But I think that the Israelis felt aggrieved that they didn't get more done, because they offered so much. Then the Palestinians felt provoked by what happened on the Temple Mount with Ariel Sharon.

Let's not get too far into this — 
We don't have to get into the weeds, but the point is that a whole series of events happened and, with each successive event, it seemed that each side misunderstood the other more.

Does any of this tend to piss you off? You formed strong personal relationships with Arafat and Barak. Do you ever just want to say, "Goddamnit, Yasser." 
Well, it's frustrating.

This will all be settled by the time this interview is published, so just speak your mind. 
It will all be settled, or it won't, by the time this comes out.

The whole thing is frustrating, but you've got to realize we're dealing with fundamental questions of identity. At Rosh Hashana, the Jews go back and read the story of Abraham and Sarah giving birth to Isaac. It's interesting, the circumstances under which the sons of Isaac were born and became separated. And it sounds like sort of an epic family tragedy, and they just sort of kept replaying it, down through the years. That's the thing that bothers me. I just hope that somehow we'll get beyond that. To the outsider who cares about them both, it seems so self-evident that the only acceptable answer is for them to find a way to live together in peace.

{Leaving the Presidency and Starting a New Life}

You're only in your mid-fifties, at the peak of your powers, with the most astonishing experience and contacts a man can have. When you're out of office, what are you going to do? 
I've laid the basic plans for my library and policy center. And I know I'm going to have an office in New York, because I'll be there as well. I've talked to a lot of people in general terms about it, but I decided that I would try to be effective in this job right up until the end. And in order to do it, I can't be spending vast amounts of time planning out my next step. I probably need a couple of months to just rest, relax, sleep, get a little perspective.

I've thought a lot about ex-presidencies. There have been two really great ones in history: John Quincy Adams and Jimmy Carter. Adams went back to the House of Representatives and became the leading spokesman for abolition. You see the Washington Monument right behind us? Adams and Abraham Linclon stood together on that mound when the Washington Monument [cornerstone was laid].

Jimmy Carter has used the Carter Center to work on human rights, election monitoring, getting rid of river blindness in Africa, agricultural self-sufficiency. From time, to time, he's engaged in various peace issues, primarily in Africa. And he works here at home on Habitat for Humanity.

The challenge is to trade power and authority, broadly spread, for influence and impact, tightly concentrated. I'm sure I'll be involved in this whole area of racial and religious reconciliation at home and around the world, and economic empowerment of poor people, here and around the world.

I'm very interested in this whole idea of the relationship of energy to economic growth and the challenge of global warming, which I believe is real. I believe we can break the iron link between how nations get rich and how they deal with the environment. I think the energy realities of the world have changed drastically in the last ten years, and they're about to really change with the development of fuel-cell engines, alternative fuels and research on biofuels. You can cut the grass out there on the South Lawn and make fuel out of it. I'm interested in all that.

I'm interested in the breakdown of public-health systems around the world. Three diseases — AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria — kill one in every four people who die every year now.

I've explored a lot of ideas, but I'm going to take some time when I get out to think about it. I want to make sure that, whatever I do, I give the next president time to be president, and I don't get in his way.

What physical change in you says that you've served eight years and that this is a job that really takes a toll? 
I'm in better shape and better health than I was eight years ago, but my hair's gray. I think that's about it. I've got a few wrinkles I didn't have eight years ago. I've held up pretty well. I've had a good time. I've enjoyed it. I couldn't help my hair going gray. It would have probably gone gray if I hadn't become president.

*** 
{The Twenty-Second Amendment}

You're the youngest retiring president since Teddy Roosevelt. Do you compare yourself much to Roosevelt? 
Well, I think the time in which I served was very much like the time in which he served. His job was to manage the transition of America from an agricultural to an industrial power and from, essentially, an isolationist to an international nation. In my time, we were managing the transition from an industrial to an information age and from a Cold War world to a multipolar, more interdependent world.

Then, when Roosevelt got out, he felt Taft had betrayed his progressive legacy. So he spent a lot of the rest of his life in political affairs. He built a third-party political movement and was a very important force. But I think the impact he might have had was tempered by his evident disappointment at not being president anymore. That's not an option for me. I can't run again, because now there's the Twenty-second Amendment.

If there wasn't the Twenty-second Amendment, would you run again?
Oh, I probably would have run again.

Do you think you would have won? 
Yes. I do. But it's hard to say, because it's entirely academic.

Do you think the Twenty-second Amendment is a good idea? Is it really consistent with democracy to have this kind of term limit on a president? 
I think the arguments for executive term limits are better than the arguments for legislative term limits — which I've never supported. On balance, the arguments for executive term limits are pretty compelling. I mean, I have an extra amount of energy and I love this job; I love the nature of this work. But maybe it's better to leave when you're in good.

Maybe they should put "consecutive" in there, limit it to two consecutive terms. See, Teddy Roosevelt was young, but he wasn't young for his time. He was 51, but he died at 60. Today, anybody who lives to 65 has a life expectancy of 82.

Is there enough time to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment? 
No, this isn't really about me, because my time is up. But you can't predict all the changes the country will face in the future and whether someone uniquely suited to a given moment will be there.

You may have people operating at a very high level of efficiency in politics from age 50 to age 80 — because of the changes in the human life cycle that are going to come about as a result of the mapping of the genome and pharmaceutical developments. We're learning we may be able to reverse Parkinson's. And we may be able to reverse Alzheimer's.

So, there are going to be a lot of things that are different about aging in the future. We are going to have to rethink it in ways we can't imagine. If it seems appropriate, some future Congress may at least limit the president to two consecutive terms. And then, if the people need a person, a man or a woman, to come back in the future, they can bring him or her back. It may take decades, but it wouldn't surprise me if it happened.

People say that you love campaigning, that you simply don't stop campaigning. How are you going to withdraw from that? 
I don't know, I do like politics. But I like governance, too. I like policy. I liked it all. That's one of the reasons why I've been so fortunate. I got to deal with politics, policy and governing, the three things that I really loved — being a governor for a dozen years and president for eight. And I think I got better at it all as I went along.

I think I'll spend a lot of time helping other people. I have worked very hard with Tony Blair to try to build this network around the world of like-minded political leaders, and if I can be helpful to them, I want to be. So, I'm sure that, from time to time, I'll get a chance to do a little politics after I leave here.

But I'm also looking forward to a different chapter in my life. I'm still young enough to learn how to do new and different things. And it's exciting to me. There's never been a period in my life which I didn't enjoy and find challenging and rewarding. I just need a little time to get my bearings, and I just hope I'm not too old to change.

*** 
{The Battle Over Gays in the Military}

One of the very first things you did in office was try to overturn the military's ban on gays. Why did this backfire, and what did you learn from that? 
I think it backfired partly because the people that were against it were clever enough to force it. I tried to slow it down, but the first week I was president, Senator Dole — who, I think, saw it as an opportunity — decided to push a vote in the Senate disapproving of the change in the policy. I tried to put it off for six months, and the Joint Chiefs came down and raised hell about it.

I wanted to do it the way Harry Truman integrated the military. He issued an executive order and gave the military leaders a couple of years to figure out how best to do it. But a lot of the gay groups wanted it done right away and had no earthly idea what kind of reaction would come. They were shocked by the amount of congressional opposition.

A lot of people think I compromised with the military. That's not what happened. We knew that at least 75 percent of the House would vote against my policy. If I was going to be able to do anything, I had to have a veto-proof minority in either the House or the Senate. But the Senate voted sixty-eight to thirty-two against my policy, which meant that I could not sustain my policy in either house.

And it was only then that I worked out with Colin Powell this dumbass "don't ask, don't tell" thing. I went to the Army War College and explained what the policy was going to be, based on the agreement we'd reached together. Then they wrote that into law, and then we had several years of problems, where it was not being implemented in any way consistent with the speech I gave at the War College — of which General Powell had agreed with every word.

[Secretary of Defense] William Cohen has now changed the training and a lot of the other elements that contributed to the fact that this policy continued to have a lot of abuse in it, and I think it's better now. But I still don't think it's the right policy. I think the policy that I wanted to implement originally was the right policy.

Would you do it any differently now? 
I wish I had been able to get an agreement on the part of everybody involved to take this out of politics. But the Republicans decided that they didn't want me to have a honeymoon. They wanted to make me the first president without one, and — now that we were living in a 24-hour news cycle — the press happily went along.

Republicans made this issue their opening salvo. And they understood — and I didn't understand exactly what I know now — how what we do here plays out in the country. But because it was one of my campaign commitments, I refused to back off. The message out in the country was, "We elected this guy to turn the economy around, and instead, his top priority is gays in the military."

But that's not true; it was Bob Dole's top priority. His top priority was making this the controversy that would consume the early days of my presidency, and it was a brilliant political move. If it happened to me again, I would say, "Why is this the Republicans' top priority? I don't want to deal with this now. We can deal with this in six months when the study is done; let's take care of the American people now."

If it happened now, all the gay groups, who are now much more sophisticated about dealing in Washington than they were then, would come in and say, "That's absolutely right." We would put it back on them. They would be in the hot box, and we could win it.

The country has come a long way on gay-rights issues since '93. Keep in mind that we did drop the ban on gays in national-security positions. We've done a lot to advance the causes the gay-rights community wanted. Plus, all the people I've appointed. The country is overwhelmingly for hate-crimes legislation. The country supports employment-nondiscrimination legislation. The only reason that we can't get those through the Congress is that the leadership of the Republican Party is way to the right of the country.

Politicians have never done much for gay rights. Why did you take it upon yourself, particularly in light of the political heat, to advance the causes of gay people? 
I believed in it. It's not very complicated. From the time I was a kid, I had known people who were gay, and I believed that their lives were hard enough with out having to be hassled about it. I also didn't buy the kind of conservative attack on them, that this was sort of a conscious choice to have a depraved lifestyle. I had had enough gay friends since I was a young man to know that that's not the case. So I saw it as a civil-rights issue. I believed in it.

I also thought that as a white Southern Protestant who could talk to a lot of the so-called Reagan Democrats — the people we had lost that came back — that I was in a unique position to do it.

Al Gore, I must say, reinforced that, because he felt it at least as strongly as I did, and he wanted to do something about it. And we thought that we could do it for the same reason we thought we ought to take on the NRA: that if we couldn't do it with our backgrounds and the kind of culture we came from, who could? When would it ever get done? And so we went and did it.

The climate today is stunningly different. What about what's going on with the Boy Scouts? 
The Boy Scouts were wrong. They were reacting to one of these stereotypes for which there is no evidence whatsoever, that gay adults are more likely to abuse children than straight adults. The Scouts were scared. The Girl Scouts have no such prohibitions and have had no known problems.

Isn't the president the honorary chairman of the Boy Scouts or something like that? 
Oh, yes. The president is always the honorary chairman of the Boy Scouts. And the gay groups asked me — no, not the gay groups — the press asked me whether I should resign from that. I decided I shouldn't, and I think that's right.

The Scouts do a world of good, and, in our time, they have begun to be more active in the cities, which is really important. Since it happened so near the end of my term, it seemed like resigning would just be a symbolic thing that would cause more harm than good. It's better for me to say I disagree with the position they took and try to persuade them to change their position, which I hope they will do.

The overwhelming thing which changes people's attitudes on these issues is personal contact, personal experience. The country will come to this. They will come to the right place on this. We'll get there. But it's a matter of personal contact.

Most gay people kept their sexual preference secret for a long time. And what a lot of venerable institutions, like the Boy Scouts, are dealing with is not so much an affirmative prejudice; they are dealing with people coming out of the closet. They are worried about their respectability. They want to go back to the way it used to be, when they didn't have to deal with these things openly.

{A New Perspective on Richard Nixon}

In your first year in office, you regularly talked with Richard Nixon. 
I've got a letter that I treasure that Nixon wrote me about Russia a month to the day before he died. How old was he then? Eighty, 81? It was really a lucid, eloquent letter, and a month later he was gone.

I had him back to the White House. I just thought that I ought to do it. He had lived a constructive life in his years out of the White House; he had written all these books; he tried to be a force in world affairs. He paid a high price for what he did, and I just thought it would be a good thing for the country to invite him back.

Was that the first time you met him? 
Actually, it's funny because I'd had two other chances in my life to meet him. I was working here in the summer of 1970, and there was a dinner where he was. And I didn't go shake hands with him, because I was young and mad about the Vietnam War. And then, in the 1980s, we were both staying in the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong. I was there on a trade mission. I was supposed to meet him, and somehow it got messed up.

He was kind of a stiff guy, right? 
Yes. He met my daughter, who was then going to Sidwell Friends, a Quaker school. His mother was a Quaker, and I think his children went there or at least had some association with Quaker schools. So he had this long talk with Chelsea, who was then thirteen. It was rather touching, because after all this time he still seemed ill at ease with people he didn't know. It was obvious to me that he had thought about what he would say when he met my daughter.

How was he with you? 
He told me he identified with me because he thought the press had been too hard on me in '92 and that I had refused to die, and he liked that. He said a lot of life was just hanging on. We had a good talk about that.

I always thought that he could have been a great president if he had been more trusting of the American people. I thought that somewhere way back there, something happened in terms of his ability to feel at home, at ease with the ebb and flow of human life and popular opinion. His weaknesses were reinforced by the way he rose to national prominence. He got elected to the House by convincing people that his opponent — Jerry Voorhis — was soft on communism; then he got elected to the Senate by convincing people that Helen Gahagan Douglas —

"The Pink Lady." 
Was soft on communism; and he busted Alger Hiss and got to be vice president when he was, I don't know, 38, 39 years old, still just a kid. Had Nixon won in 1960, he would have been as young as I was when I got elected.

So, all of a sudden, after two terms in Congress and a couple of years as a senator, boom, he was vice president for eight years. And how did he do this? By whipping up popular opinion into a frenzy by demonizing his opponents. That reinforced some of his weaknesses.

If he had had to run like I did, in a little state, where you had to go to every country crossroads and where people expect you to run the governor's office like a country store and where you were used to brutal campaigns and used to trusting people to see through them — if you fought hard enough — I think it might have rounded him in a different way. I think it might have prepared him a little.

By all early accounts, he was a nicer guy before the Jerry Voorhis campaign. 
Well, look, when he ran for president, he got 35 percent of the black vote. And, for a Republican, he had a good record on civil rights in the House and the Senate. When he got to be president he signed the legislation that created the EPA and OSHA and a lot of other stuff. The guy had a very fertile policy mind; he could get out of his ideological box. Remember, it was Nixon who imposed wage and price controls in 1971.

And effectively. 
He understood that only a Republican could go to China.

Which presidents do you feel the most affinity for, in terms of the problems they faced and the way they've handled them? 
FDR and Wilson — except I didn't have a war, thank God. But Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson were dealing with the kinds of challenges that I have dealt with, both at home and around the world. And so I identified with them a lot. And Truman — I liked Truman a lot. I'm from Arkansas, and we border Missouri: I was raised on Harry Truman.

Truman also had to create a new era. Even though most of his ideas — like the U.N. — were hatched when FDR was still alive, he had to organize a world where, after the Second World War, our commitment to the world was not an option. Under Truman, we had to create a set of international institutions where we could be leaders, but also in which we were also interdependent.

On Board Air Force One

On the day after Halloween, we meet up with the president again, at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, D.C. Up close, Air Force One is truly awesome and bespeaks all the grandeur and power of the presidency of the United States. It is spotless and gleaming in the morning sun, a flying corporate headquarters loaded into a supersize 747. Secret Service men and military security are there to protect the president and the plane itself, and they sit in back with the traveling press pool. The press is being shown Gladiator and the Secret Service guys, Nutty Professor II, though they will rightfully switch midflight. In the middle of the plane are the staff offices, a conference and screening room with space for thirty people. The president's office is toward the front of the plane. When we enter, he is sitting at his desk, a filled-in crossword puzzle — ripped out of a newspaper — to the side. On a legal pad in front of him, he has written down the names of all fifty states, how many electoral votes each one has and which candidate likely has what. On the couch sits a set of Elvis videos. He wants to talk about Almost Famous for a few minutes, and then the interview begins again.

{The 2000 Election: Why It's So Close}

Why do you think the presidential race is so tight? Given the economy, the issues, the incumbency — how could it get to be this close? 
For one thing, things have been good for a long time. And a lot of people may take it for granted. They may not be as clear as they should be on what specific policies contributed to it and what could undermine it. I think that's one issue.

I also think that there's not as much general awareness as there might be about the differences between the two parties on health care, education, the environment and crime — where I believe the things we've done over the last eight years had a measurable impact on all those things going in the right direction.

And, third, most presidential races are fairly close, because a lot of presidential voting is cultural.

The way you were raised? 
Yeah, the way you were raised and the neighborhood you live in and your socioeconomic and ethnic background. A lot of it's culture.

Keep in mind that in the history of our republic, only two vice presidents have ever been directly elected president. In one of those elections, when Martin Van Buren succeeded Andrew Jackson, we were effectively a one-party country. In the other, when George Bush defeated Michael Dukakis, the country was not in as good a shape as it is now, but it was in pretty good shape.

Bush basically destroyed Dukakis. It was a hugely negative campaign, with a lot of charges that were never effectively rebutted.

This year has been a much more positive race. There have been differences on the issues — but, you know, neither one of them has called each other's patriotism into question or whether they're normal Americans — which is basically the rap that was put on Dukakis, like reverse plastic surgery.

*** 
{The Oklahoma City Bombing}

One of the most important jobs that you as president have is to talk to the country in the wake of a national tragedy, to frame the issues. How did you respond to this responsibility after the bombing in Oklahoma City? 
I remember making a statement at the beginning, right in the Rose Garden, saying, what you would expect me to say: expressing the nation's sympathy for the loss — but also urging the American people not to jump to conclusions about who had done it. In the beginning, a lot of people were saying it was obviously some sort of act of foreign terrorism.

When I went to Oklahoma City for the memorial service, I tried to elevate what the people who worked in that building were doing — that they were public servants. I told myself that I would never again refer to people who worked for the government — even in agencies I thought weren't performing well — as bureaucrats.

At that time, it was fashionable to bash the government. For more than a dozen years, we had been hearing demeaning rhetoric about the nature of government and public service. I tried to point out that these people were our friends and neighbors and relatives. They are an important part of America's family, and their service ought to be honored in that way.

A few weeks later, I gave the commencement speech at Michigan State University. I really believe that was the turning of the tide against the venom of anti-government feeling. The American people are fundamentally decent, and they've got a lot of sense. And I thought that this might break a fever, really, that had been gripping us for too long. And I think it did.

That's where you said, in effect, "You can't love your country if you hate your government." Were you thinking, "I'd like to take advantage of this tragedy" — and with every tragedy comes an opportunity — "to make people rethink certain ideas"? 
Yeah. I think, maybe not even at a conscious level, the American people were rethinking it. And maybe that's why what I said at the memorial service struck a responsive chord in the country.

Did you mean to connect the Oklahoma City bombing to the metaphorical bomb-throwing of House Speaker Newt Gingrich? 
No, I was careful not to do that, I wanted to change the American people's attitude toward public servants and their government. But to do it, you had to focus on what happened.

One of the things that I didn't like about Newt — and he certainly wasn't responsible in any way for the Oklahoma City bombing — was that he was always blaming the 1960s or liberals for everything that went wrong. When that woman, Susan Smith, drove her kids into the lake in South Carolina, he blamed the 1960s. And it turned out that the poor woman had been sexually abused by her stepfather, who was on the local board of the Christian Coalition or something. And when those two young boys dropped that kid out of the window in Chicago, he blamed the welfare culture. He was always blaming. So I didn't want to get into reverse blaming. I just wanted to try to make it clear to the American people that we shouldn't have a presumption against government in general or public servants in particular.

*** 
{The Columbine Shootings}

What did you do when you heard the news about Columbine? 
I called the local officials and the school officials from the Oval Office. You know, that was only the most recent and the most grotesque of a whole series of highly visible school shootings that we had — and a number of them in the South. One of them, in Jonesboro, Arkansas, that was in my home state — where I knew some of the people who were involved, who run the school, and in the county and the city. There was one in Pearl, Mississippi, and there was one in Oregon.

I thought a lot of things. Number one: How'd those kids get all those guns? And how could they have had that kind of arsenal without their parents knowing? And I thought, after I read a little about it: How did they get so lost, without anybody finding them before they went over the edge?

We had a spate of killings associated with a kind of darkness on the Net.

What do you mean, "darkness on the Net"? 
Well, I mean, those kids were apparently into some sort of a satanic thing. There were, earlier, a number of kids who killed themselves who were into talking to each other about some kind of destruction. I worried then — I'm worried now — about the people in our society, particularly children, that just drift off. Maybe one of those kids could have been saved if somebody had been there to help, and then all those other children would still be alive.

***
{Fighting the NRA}

It seems shocking that we didn't get any major new gun-control legislation in the wake of that event. 
You can't say nothing came out of it, because there was an organization of the young people in Colorado that organized kids all over the country to back commonsense gun legislation. They got about 10,000 kids involved. Then we had the Million Mom March.

But the truth is that when legislation time comes, a lot of the people in Congress are still frightened of the NRA. Even though there's broad public support for these measures, they're still not primary voting issues for a lot of the people who are for them.

The NRA can muster an enormous percentage of the vote — maybe 15 percent, even 20 percent in some districts, because for those people guns are a primary voting issue. So if you've got a race where you're ahead 60 to 30, but in your 60 percent, gun control is a primary voting issue for 10 percent of the people, and in their 30 it's a primary voting issue for 20 percent of their people — the truth is, you're a net loser by 10 percent. That's what happens in Congress and state legislatures. They're genuinely afraid.

The NRA is great at raising money and building their organizational power by terrifying people with inflammatory rhetoric. Did you see the tirade that Charlton Heston carried on against Al Gore and me, saying that we were glad some of these people were killed, because it gave me an excuse to take people's guns away? We never proposed anything that would take anybody's guns away. I saw a special on television the other night, on ABC — Peter Jennings went out to some of these gun shows and talked to all these people who were absolutely convinced that we wanted to take their guns away.

You got the Brady Bill and a partial assault-weapons ban through Congress in your first term. Why didn't you seize the opportunity, with this post-Columbine atmosphere? You called a White House conference on violence in movies and video games. 
Yeah, but we also did lots and lots and lots of events.

And then you thought you could reason with the NRA. 
No, I didn't think I could reason with the NRA. I thought Congress would be so shocked and the public so galvanized that we would have a window of opportunity.

So what happened? 
The GOP leadership just delayed until the fever went down. That's what happened. They knew that they couldn't afford to have their members voting wrong on closing the gun-show loophole or banning the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips — which allows people to get around the assault-weapons ban.

Were you powerless to do something about that? 
We finally got a vote in the Senate, where you can bring things up. And we got a majority vote for it. Al Gore broke the tie. But we couldn't get a bill out of the conference committee in the House. If we could ever have gotten a clean vote —

Then you would have won that vote? 
Oh, absolutely. We could win the vote today if we could get a vote. But the leadership in the Republican Party — as long as they're in the majority in both houses — can control things, especially in the House. You can write the rules so that you can just keep stuff from coming up.

So despite your power, despite that tragedy —
Yeah. And we had lots and lots and lots of events at the White House. We pushed and pushed. I'll remind you that one of the reasons that Democrats are in the minority today is because of the Brady law and the assault-weapons law. There's not a single hunter that's missed an hour of hunting, not a single sport shooter has missed an event. They acted like it was the end of the world. But half a million felons, fugitives and stalkers haven't gotten handguns because of the Brady law.

The level of logic and arguments on this issue are stupefying. 
I feel passionately about this. And I'm glad I took them on — and I'm just sorry I couldn't win more. There's a lot of good people out there in America who work hard, and their only recreation is hunting and fishing. They don't follow politics all that closely. They get these NRA mailings. They're good people, but they think they can believe these folks. And the NRA knows that if they can stir them up, they can raise more money, increase their membership. And they do it by basically terrifying Congress.

*** 
{Race Relations: Changing the Climate}

How would you characterize race relations today, as compared with when you took office? 
I think they're considerably better. The country is growing ever more diverse and, therefore, more and more people are having more contacts across racial, ethnic and religious lines. Ultimately, the more people relate to each other, the more they come to not just tolerate — I don't like the word "tolerance" in this context, because it implies one group's superior, putting up with an inferior group — the more they come to genuinely appreciate each other's heritage, find it interesting and find a fundamental common humanity. I think a lot of it is just systematic human contact.

Beyond the human contact, the race initiative we started led to hundreds of efforts, all over the country, to have honest conversations. Sometimes people work around each other for years, and they don't know the first thing about one another. Forget about race; I mean, there are people who work in the White House and see each other every day but probably don't know the first thing about one another.

My administration may have had some impact because we were so much more diverse than any administration in history: People felt that the White House was their house, too, the government was their government, too.

How else has the climate changed? 
Look at the difference in the rhetoric of the presidential campaign this year — it's all about racial inclusion. We could argue about the policies — I think that the Republican policies are still divisive — but the rhetoric is about inclusion. And even a number of the Republican members have taken a different tack on immigration.

*** 
{The War on Drugs: Treatment and the Need for Prison Reform}

Do you think that people should go to jail for possessing, using or even selling small amounts of marijuana? Is that appropriate? 
I think, first of all —

We're not publishing this until after the election. 
I understand that. I think that most small amounts of marijuana have been decriminalized in some places, and should be.

We really need a reexamination of our entire policy on imprisonment. Some people deliberately hurt other people, and they ought to be in jail because they can't be trusted to be on the streets. Some people do things that are so serious they have to be put in jail to discourage other people from doing similar things.

But a lot of people are in prison today because they have drug problems or alcohol problems. And too many of them are getting out — particularly out of state systems — without treatment, without education, without skills, without serious efforts at job placement. There are tons of people in prison who are nonviolent offenders — who have drug-related charges that are directly related to their own drug problems.

Should we be putting nonviolent drug offenders in jail at all? Or should we put them in treatment programs that are more fitting? 
I think it depends on what they did. You know, I have some experience with this. My brother — whom I love and am immensely proud of — kicked a big cocaine habit. His habit got up to four grams a day. He was lucky to live through that — and if he hadn't had the constitution of an ox, he might not have.

I think if he hadn't gone to prison — and actually been put away, forcibly, somewhere — it is doubtful that he would have come to grips with it. He was still denying that he was addicted, right up until the time he was sentenced. So I'm not so sure that incarceration is all bad, even for drug offenders, depending on the facts. I think there are some —

Well, right now, what I'm trying to get at — 
Let me finish. I think the sentences in many cases are too long for nonviolent offenders, and the facilities are not structured to maximize success when the people get out. Keep in mind — 90 percent of the people that are in the penitentiary are going to get out. So society's real interest is to see that we maximize the chance that when they get out, they can go back to being productive citizens. That they'll get jobs, they'll pay taxes, they'll be good fathers and mothers, and they'll do good things. And I think this whole thing needs to be reexamined. Even in the federal system — these sentencing guidelines —

Would you do away with mandatory minimum sentences? 
Most judges think we should. I certainly think they should be reexamined. And the disparities are unconscionable between crack and powdered cocaine. I tried to change that. The Republican Congress was willing to narrow but not eliminate them, the theory being that people who used crack were more violent than people who used cocaine. What they really meant was: People that used crack were more likely to be poor — and, coincidentally, black or brown. And therefore not have money. Those people that used cocaine were more likely to be rich, pay for it and therefore be peaceful.

We need a serious reexamination with the view toward what would make us a more peaceful, more productive society. Our imprisonment policies are counterproductive. And now you have a lot of places where, before the economy picked up, prison building was the main source of economic activity and prison employment was one of the big areas of job growth.

Do you think people should lose access to college loans because they've been convicted of smoking pot? Which is now a law. 
No.

Do you think that we need a major rethink of what these drug-sentencing laws are? 
Not just drugs. I think we need to look at: Who's in prison? What are the facts?

I don't believe, by and large, in permanent lifetime penalties. There's a bill in Congress today that has bipartisan support — that I was hoping would pass before I left office, but which I feel confident will pass in the next year or two — that would restore voting rights to former prisoners after their full sentences have been discharged. And they wouldn't have to apply for a federal pardon to get it.

I changed the law in Arkansas when I was attorney general. I changed the voting-rights law in 1977, to restore voting rights to people after they've served their sentence. And my state's one of the relatively few states in the country where you do not have to get a pardon from the governor to register to vote again. Or from the federal government, for that matter. Keeping them with a scarlet letter on their foreheads for the rest of their lives, or a chain around their neck, is not very productive.

*** 
{War in the Balkans}

The Balkan intervention was your only major military engagement. What was it like to run a war, night after night? What were your feelings as you went to sleep every night? 
I went to sleep every night praying that it would end that night — that Milosevic would give in.

Literally praying? 
Yeah. And praying that nobody would die, that no American would die. And hoping that no innocent civilians would die but knowing that they would. It's easy for people to talk about war and when it's appropriate to use military force. But you have to know that once human beings start using big powerful weapons, there will be unintended consequences. We wound up bombing the Chinese Embassy, and innocent people died. We hit a school bus.

We have the most skilled air force, with the most sophisticated weapons, in all human history. We had fewer casualties than in the Gulf War, which is normally thought of as a hundred-hour war and a model of technical proficiency, and a lot of the American casualties were from friendly fire. The same thing happened even in the small engagement in Grenada, under President Reagan. These things happen. Once you start killing people, there will be unintended consequences.

How do you get yourself — as a person and as a politician — ready to make the decision to make a military commitment? 
You have to be convinced that the consequences of inaction will be more damaging to more people and to your country. And in the case of Kosovo, I didn't think it was close. They had already killed several thousand Kosovars, and they were running some 800,000 of them out of their homes. It was a clear case of ethnic cleansing. And I thought the United States, and our European allies, had to stand up against it. We couldn't let it happen in the heart of Europe. If we did that, we would lose the ability to stop it anywhere else.

Wouldn't it be on your conscience, in some way, for having failed to stop it? 
Absolutely. One of the things that just tore at me was how long it took me to build a consensus. It took me two years to build a consensus among our allies for military action in Bosnia. And, as you know, what happened there was, we did a few airstrikes and, all of a sudden, we were at Dayton holding peace talks.

And for all the raggedness of it, the Bosnian peace has held, and it's better now — because we turned back the tide of ethnic cleansing. But over 200,000 people died there. And I just knew there was no point in letting it happen again in Kosovo.

*** 
{Africa and the Slaughter in Rwanda}

How do you feel, then, about Rwanda? Clearly, it's a different situation: We didn't have the allies in place, we didn't have the intelligence in place. Is there anything that we could have done to prevent it? Do you feel any responsibility, personally? 
I feel terrible about it. One of the reasons that I went to Tanzania, to be with Mandela, to try to talk the Burundians into the peace agreement, was because, before my time, over 200,000 people were killed in Burundi. Same deal — the Hutus and the Tutsis. Same tribes, fighting the same battles. The thing that was shocking about Rwanda was that it happened so fast, and it happened with almost no guns. The idea that 700,000 people could be killed in a hundred days, mostly with machetes, is hard to believe. It was an alien territory; we weren't familiar.

After that we began working very earnestly in Africa to train troops to be able to go in and prevent such things. We worked very hard with something called the Africa Crisis Response Initiative. We are now working with Ghanaian forces and Nigerian forces to give them the training and the capacity to prevent the resumption of the slaughter in Sierra Leone.

I think and hope that the United States will be much more involved in Africa from now on. In economic development, we passed the Africa trade bill this year. And in fighting AIDS, TB, malaria in Africa; in debt relief — we passed big debt-relief legislation this year — and we helped them to develop the mechanisms to do this. And when the African countries have leaders who are willing to go in and take their responsibility in these areas, we'll give them the logistical and other support necessary to do it.

That's what happened in East Timor, where we didn't have to put troops on the ground. But we sent 500 people over there and provided vital airlift and logistical and other support — so that the Australians, the New Zealanders and the other troops that came in could bring an end to the slaughter there. There's sort of a sliding scale here. In Europe it had to be done by NATO. The scale of it and the power of the Serbian government were such that if we hadn't been directly involved with our NATO allies, we never could have turned it back. If we had done all the things we've done since Rwanda in Africa — what would have happened is, the African troops would have moved in, they would have stopped it, and we could have given them the logistical support they needed to stop it.

Another reason to vote for Gore? 
Another huge reason to vote for Gore. Governor Bush has said that he doesn't think that's the business of the American military. We're only supposed to fight and win wars. He kept talking about Kosovo, I noticed, as if we were the only forces in Kosovo. We're only 15 percent of the soldiers in Kosovo.

*** 
{The Nature of the Republican Party}

Why do you think you were such a lightning rod for partisanship and bitterness and so much hatred during your terms in Washington? 
There were a lot of reasons. Mostly, it's just because I won. [The Republicans] believed the only reason they lost in 1976 to Jimmy Carter was because of Watergate. They believed that from the time Mr. Nixon won in '68, they had found a foolproof formula to hold the White House forever — until some third party came in. That's what they believed.

Did you ever hear a Republican articulate that? 
Well, not in so many words. I had a very candid relationship with a lot of those guys. They would tell me what was going on. They really believed that America saw Republicans as the guarantor of the country's superiority in values and prudence in financial matters and that they could always turn Democrats into cardboard cutouts of what they really were. They could sort of caricature them as almost un-American. Congress might be Democratic most of the time, because Congress would give things to the American people. But the Republicans provided the values, the strength, the heritage of the country. And they could always sort of do — as I've said about Dukakis — reverse plastic surgery on any Democrat.

So I came along, and I had ideas on crime and welfare and economic management and foreign policy that were difficult for them to characterize in that way. And we won. And they were really mad.

I think, secondly, I was the first baby-boomer president. Not a perfect person — never claimed to be. And I opposed the Vietnam War. I think that made them doubly angry, because they thought I was a cultural alien and I made it anyway.

So you think the culture wars were very much a part of this atmosphere? 
Mmm-hmm. I also think they were even more angry because I was a white Southern Baptist. They didn't like losing the White House, and they didn't like me. They didn't like what they thought I represented. They had worked very hard to have the old white-male Southern culture dominate the political life of America. And they saw me as an apostate — which I welcome. When I take on the NRA or do something for gay rights, to them, it's worse if I do it. It's like a Catholic being pro-choice.

That all happened at the time when we had this huge growth in conservative talk shows, associated think tanks and networks that grew up in Washington from the time of Nixon through the time of Bush. They had sort of a permanent alternative government set up by that time. They went to war the first day of my presidency.

Were you surprised by the difficulties you had in your own party? Georgia Senator Sam Nunn opposed you on gays in the military; Pat Moynihan criticized your health-care proposal; and Bob Kerrey gave you a hard time with your economic plan. 
Not particularly. On gays in the military, a lot of the Democrats who were culturally conservative but pro-military thought that the gays in the military coming up so early was inconsistent with the whole New Democratic approach we were taking. Plus, they thought I was wrong. But, as I explained to you — when we talked last: I didn't bring it up first; Bob Dole did.

Now, on the other issues — the fundamental problem there was that there are no easy answers. Bob Kerrey comes from Nebraska. He and Jim Exon were Democrats, but Nebraska's one of the most Republican states in the country. He thought we should have maybe cut spending a little more or raised taxes a little less — or cut taxes a little less on lower-income working people.

But these guys were your party elders. Shouldn't they have said, "Clinton's our new president. Let's let him have his way"? 
Yeah, but I didn't take offense at that. Moynihan believed, first of all — with some justification — that he knew more about most areas of social policy than anybody else did. I think he felt we were making a political mistake not to do welfare reform first, which turned out to be right. Secondly, he felt that Washington could not absorb, in a two-year period, the economic plan, which he strongly supported. He was terrific: the NAFTA trade agreement, which he totally supported and which was controversial within our party, and this major health-care thing. He said, "The system cannot absorb this much change in this short a time."

I didn't take offense at it. They thought I was being bullheaded. And I think, in retrospect, they were probably right.

{The Struggle With Newt Gingrich}

What was your relationship with Newt like? 
I had an unusual relationship with him. First of all, it depended on which Newt showed up. The good Newt I found engaging and intelligent; we were surprisingly in agreement in the way we viewed the world.

Due to being the same age? 
Partly. Newt supported me in virtually all of my foreign-policy initiatives. And after he got his Congress, he realized that a hundred of them had never had a passport. I remember him calling me once, wanting me to get them to go on foreign missions. He said, "If you ask them, then they can't be attacked back home for going on boondoggle trips."

We actually had a very cordial relationship. He was very candid with me about his political objectives. And he, in turn, from time to time, would get in trouble with the right wing of his own caucus, because they said I could talk him into too much.

On the other hand, as I told you, when he did things like blaming every bad thing that happened in America on Democrats, the 1960s and all that — I thought it was highly destructive.

How did it make you feel personally? 
At some point, probably around 1996, I got to the point where I no longer had personal feelings about those things — like the Whitewater investigation and the travel-office investigation. Newt was smart. He knew there was nothing in any of that stuff. It was all politics to him; it was about power.

But he really did believe that the object of politics was to destroy your opponent. He ran [former Democratic House Speaker] Jim Wright out of Congress on account of that. And he had an enormous amount of success. He won the Congress basically by having a take-no-prisoners, be-against-everything approach.

Didn't he tell you once on the phone that he was planning to lead a revolution against you? 
He thought he was leading a revolution, and I was in the way. I thought he was a worthy adversary, and I thought I would defeat him. I thought the American people would stick with me. He thought that he could create, for the rest of my presidency, almost a parliamentary system, where he'd be the prime minister and make the policy, and I'd be in charge of foreign policy, and he'd help me.

There hasn't been as powerful and as antagonistic a speaker of the House in modern times. You had somebody actually out there, daily, fighting you. Newt vs. Bill. 
Yeah. But that's what they decided to do. And you know, now I have a speaker in Denny Hastert, who I can really work with — we got a lot done. The dominant power in the caucus is still Tom DeLay and Dick Armey. And if they had their druthers, they'd still follow the other approach. But the balance of authority, of power, is so close in the House that, more often than not, we work things out.

In the Senate, you've got the same thing with Trent Lott. I have a very cordial personal relationship with Lott. I have a lot in common with Lott, our background and childhood. His daddy was a laboring person. He, as well, could have been a Democrat.

How'd you develop your strategy for dealing with Newt — waiting him out, then outflanking him? 
I felt, after they won, that when the people actually saw the fine print on their contract, they would think it was a "Contract On America" instead of a "Contract With America." I had to oppose them where I thought they were wrong. But I couldn't let them push me back into the old confrontation, where they could say, "Clinton's an old Democrat." So, for example, instead of just fighting him on the budget, I offered my own balanced budget.

I thought they had to have a chance to run out their string. When we got to the government shutdown, I wasn't just against what they were doing — I had an alternative. It's easier for the Republicans to be against everything than the Democrats, because people view us as the party of affirmative government. I believed in balancing the budget. I just didn't want to do it the way they wanted to.

What's the bottom line on Newt? If you were a historian, what would you say about Gingrich? 
That he was immensely successful in consolidating the power of the Republican Party in its right wing and then winning the Congress, winning the historic struggle for Congress in 1994, by opposing me right down the line.

In '94, the economy was getting better, but the people didn't feel it yet; the budget we passed did not impose great tax burdens on ordinary Americans, but they didn't know it yet. And the crime bill we passed was going to help bring the crime rate down — without interfering with people's gun rights — but they didn't know it yet.

Gingrich had the best of all times to run through a gaping hole. And then I made the mistake of trying to do both the economic plan and NAFTA — which dispirited some of our base supporters — and then health care, under circumstances that were literally impossible. You could not get a universal-coverage plan past the Congress.I made a lot of errors, and he ran through them, and he, therefore, changed the Congress.

People will say that we had one of these historic battles that periodically happens in America about the role of the national government and, indeed, what the meaning of the nation is, And I think he thought he could actually carry out the revolution that President Reagan talked about: drastically shrinking the federal government, drastically limiting its ability to act in the social sphere and moving it to the right.

To me, we had a series of battles that were really the latest incarnation of this age-old battle of "What does it mean to be an American?" "What is the idea of America?" "What is the purpose of the nation?" And the first one was the government shutdown; there was an impeachment; and I vetoed the Newt tax bill after Newt was gone. All these were ongoing battles.

The same thing is now shaping up over the courts. The most important issue in this election may well be what happens to the Supreme Court. Because we're one vote away from having enough votes that would repeal Roe v. Wade. There are other issues in the courts, which I think are quite profound. There are five votes right now to restrict the ability of Congress to require the states to participate in protecting the American people in a lot of fundamental ways. This is an ongoing battle.

It's the same battle that we had between George Washington and John Adams — and Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall on the one side, and Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine and a lot of other people on the other — in the beginning. The same battle Abraham Lincoln had around the time of the Civil War: Could the states secede? Did the federal government have the power to enslave them? Same battle we had at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution when Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson asserted the authority of the nation to prescribe basic conditions in the workplace.

{Reflections on Impeachment}

In the history books, it will say, of course, that you were the second president ever to be impeached. How does that make you feel? Will it cloud your real accomplishments? 
The history books will also record, I think, that both impeachments were wrong. And that's why they failed. And I'm just grateful that, unlike Andrew Johnson, I was less embittered by it, and I had more support, from the public and in the Congress, and so I was able to resume my duties and actually get a lot done for the American people in the aftermath.

Was there ever a point you wanted to give up or it just became too hard? 
Never.

Did you ever get so angry during it that you think it clouded your judgment? 
I got angry, but I always was alone with friends who would deflate me. I don't think it ever clouded my judgment on any official thing. I realized that, when it was all over, I would have the responsibility to work with the Republicans as well as the Democrats.

One of the things I had to learn — it took me almost my whole first term to learn it — was that, at some point, presidents are not permitted to have personal feelings. When you manifest your anger in public, it should be on behalf of the American people and the values that they believe in. All this stuff you can't take personally.

I realized that for the people who were directing it, it was just politics. It's about power and politics. So I was largely able to purge myself of it. I had very strong personal feelings about it, but I tried never to talk about it. I tried to get up every day and just do my job and let others defend me, publicly, and get on with the work of the country.

And vent in private. Presidents will always be under siege in some way or another. If you don't want the job, and the attendant heat, you shouldn't ask for it.

Does it make you uncomfortable to talk about this episode now? 
No. I just think the less I say about it right now, the better. I think when more time passes, more people will see what happened and the more it will come out. There have been some pretty good books written about it.

What do you think of Ken Starr now? 
I think he did what he was hired to do.

You told me you never really met him and had no ill feelings. 
I met him once, when he interviewed me. But he was hired to keep the inquiry going past the '96 election and to do whatever damage he could. That's why he was put in, and he did what they asked him to do.

What's your take on Representative Henry Hyde — who was supposed to be Mr. Reasonable, and then went and seemingly defied the will of the people after the '98 elections? 
He did what he was hired to do, too. The right wing was in control of the Congress, and they thought they had paid in the 1998 elections when they nearly lost the House. They thought they had a free shot to put a hit on me, and so they did. I don't think it's complicated.

They stayed with their right wing, and they thought they would pay no price in 2000. They thought, whatever happened, it would all be over by then. They thought they could put a black mark on me in history, and that was really important to them. They were really angry they got beat, they were angry.

And it's not an issue now in this election, really. 
It is in three or four House seats, but not many.

It's an issue to me. 
But it shouldn't be. I think the only way it should be an issue in the election is that it indicates how important it is that there's someone in the White House who can restrain them. Because it's just one example of other things they were doing: to the environmental laws of our country, to the education laws, to the health-care system.

I don't know why that should be an issue. I mean, it's over, and the American people shouldn't expect to dwell on it. They shouldn't have to deal with it.

Who do you think really came through for you and got up and defended you? 
Oh, tons of people. The House Judiciary Committee Democrats were really good. And, you know, there were 800 people — including a lot of Republicans who didn't even like me — who filed testimony, talking about how inappropriate it was. And there was that bipartisan panel of career prosecutors, who said that no one would bring any criminal charges on this. A lot of people came forward who had no particular reason to do it. But they were caring about their country, and they were offended by what was going on.

Do you think it was in some way a referendum on the nature, morality or character of the American people? 
Not really. People strongly disagreed with what I did. I did, too, I think that they just were able to discriminate between a bad personal mistake and the justification for a constitutional crisis. I think it's about their ability to discriminate between two different kinds of problems and not any change in moral standards.

Do you think we learned anything from the impeachment process? 
The one thing it did was point out all the other excesses, that there was a bogus Whitewater investigation. That civil lawsuit against me was bogus. Even the judge who was famous for disliking me personally threw it out as having no merit.

I think that — at least for the time being — it took a lot of the venom out of our public life. Even as hard as George Bush and Al Gore are hitting each other in this election, they're by and large hitting each other over the issues.

Bush has got some ad up now questioning Gore's integrity — it's amazing that Bush would question Gore's integrity. He knows that there's a certain number of voters who vote for Republicans because they're convinced that they're morally superior to Democrats, notwithstanding the fact that we're awash in evidence now that they're not. And so he's doing that. But there's been very little of that, even from him.

The level of venom is lower than it was. And maybe I absorbed enough for several years. And if so, then that alone might make it worth doing.

It's just crazy for America to have all these fabulous opportunities and some pretty stiff challenges out there to waste our elections and our public officials' time with things that we know are bogus and trivial and cost the taxpayers a fortune, for no other purpose than for one side to pursue political advantage over another. There'll always be some of that. But my instinct is that, in the next four years, we'll have a lot less of it.

{The President and the Press}

As president, you have a relationship with the press that's unique in the world: You are subject to more criticism, more attention — more everything. What's your take on the press in America? 
It's very difficult to generalize. On balance, it's a great advantage for the president to have the bully pulpit that can reach everyone in America, everyone in the world, instantaneously. Any criticism that the president has about negative press or incessant carping or whatever — you've got to temper that with the fact that they make it possible for you to do your job in the communications age.

I also admire the reporters who are on this airplane, Because I've worked harder and keep long hours, it's been a hard job for them. They go around in the vans, not on Air Force One and helicopters. They have a lot of hard work to do, and by and large, most of them do it as well as they can and as honestly as they can. I have an enormous amount of respect for them.

There's another part of the press — almost a celebrity political press, all the way from the columnists to the people who are on all these talk shows all the time. In order for them to be successful, their comments have to have edge; they tend to be more negative and more dogmatic. There tends to be more heat than light in a lot of what's said in those forums and formats. But that's part of the new age we're living in: They're on the cutting edge between the serious press, the tabloid press, pure political advocacy and entertainment.

You've got all these segments now that are kind of blurred together, compounded by a 24-hour news cycle. The fact that there are umpty-ump channels for people to watch — some of which are news channels, and they have to go after a narrow segment of the market. If you took it all seriously, it'd really be nuts, you know? Once you realize what the environment is, you just learn to deal with it.

The important thing is, too, for presidents especially, to try to hear the criticism. Because it's not always wrong, sometimes it's right, and I find it easier, really, when it comes from thoughtful columnists who are really trying to make a serious contribution to the national debate.

Which columnists or reporters do you think have been particularly smart in their coverage of you in the last eight years? 
Tom Friedman [New York Times foreign-affairs columnist] is the best one, possibly, that we have, by a long stretch. He understands the world we're living in and the one toward which we are moving. Therefore, whether he's criticizing me or analyzing an issue, he's trying to do it from a completely honest point of view. I think [Los Angeles Times political writer] Ron Brownstein is one of the two or three best political columnists in America today. Truly extraordinary. He understood the ideas that underlay the '92 campaign and the whole Democratic Leadership Council effort. He made it his business to study that. I think [Washington Post columnist] E.J. Dionne is good.

Do you harbor any resentment toward The New York Times for its role in Whitewater? 
It's sort of like what they did to Wen Ho Lee, in a way. The same reporter got a story, it was overwritten, and dire things were predicted. But whatever I feel about that has to be tempered by the fact that the Times has a serious conscience when it comes to the national issues. They really have tried and have consistently done an excellent job of analysis. They were trying to come out in the right place, in the right way. So whatever I feel about them is tempered by that.

Do you think, institutionally, it's working right, the press as a whole? 
They're doing the best they can in a very new and different environment. I have a lot of sympathy for them. How can presidents hate the press? You can gripe all you want about all the negative coverage you get on the evening news or on the talk shows or being blasted in the newspaper or having them get on something when they're dead wrong, like Whitewater — where they're just dead wrong. But every day they're writing about all the things that affect the American people in their lives. Anytime you want a microphone to have your say, you've got it. So I think to be obsessively negative is a mistake.

{Leaving the White House, and a Word of Advice}

What creature comforts are you going to miss the most about leaving the White House — about not living there? 
The movie theater ... the swimming pool ... Camp David. Everybody says I'll miss Air Force One the most once I have to return to commercial travel.

What I will miss the most is not the creature comforts. It's the honor of living in the White House, which I have loved. I love my country — I love the history of my country. I was a pretty good American historian before I got there, and I know a lot more now than I did then. I've read a lot about presidents who most people don't know much about — including me before I got here. And, even more than that, I'll miss the work. It's the job I'll miss the most — I love the work. I actually love doing this job.

Do you just get off every single day when you get up? 
Every day. Even on the worst day. Even in the worst times of that whole impeachment thing. I just thank God every day I can go to work. I love the job — and I always loved it.

On the other hand, is there anything that seems attractive to you about not living there anymore? 
I look forward to being a citizen again. It'll be the first time in eighteen years that I've really had a private home that was my primary residence. I'll get up every day feeling a responsibility to be of public service, but knowing that, basically, I'm in control of my life again. It'll be an interesting challenge for me. Eighteen years is a long time to be a chief executive, living in public houses — with every day scripted out hours and hours every day. Particularly if you work like I do. It's a challenge; I'm gonna be interested to see whether I can meet it and what it means, going to this next chapter of my life. I'm actually excited about it.

What's the one thing that'll surprise the next guy who becomes president, that they just can't know now? What was the greatest surprise to you? And what advice would you give the next president?
He will be surprised how many different things happen at once. Now, Al won't be as surprised by that, because he's been there eight years. That's another good argument for voting for him, because he knows the experience and he makes good decisions. He'll be a very good president if he wins — he'll be quite good.

The environment, I think, will be less hostile for either one of them than it was for me, and they'll have more of an opportunity to craft cooperative solutions. Under almost any conceivable scenario, Congress will be even more closely divided than it is now, which will require them to all work together. I hope they do. But they'll still be surprised at how many different things they'll have crashing in on them at once.

What particular advice would you have? 
After Election Day, they ought to get more rest than I did. I didn't really take a vacation. I think they ought to clear their heads. I would advise them to work as hard as they can to get a good cabinet and a good staff, and then really emphasize teamwork. And when you come to the tough decisions, do what you think is right. It's just not in the nature of human existence to be free of difficulty. When you come down to those tough decisions, you just have to do what you think is right. Tell the American people why you did it and hope they'll go along with it.

{"Gore Will Win"}

This interview comes out after the election. So give me a prediction. 
I've always believed Gore would win, and I still do. In the closing days of this election, people will begin to think about whether they really want to risk this prosperity by adopting an economic plan that has a huge tax cut, a huge Social Security privatization program and a bunch of spending that'll put us back into deficit.

People will have to think about whether they want to risk having nobody to restrain a Republican Congress, if they should stay in the majority. And I think they'll think about what will happen to the courts. Those things will be enough to put Al Gore over, and I think he'll be elected.

What do you think the margin is going to be — the popular vote? 
I have no idea. I think it'll definitely be close in the popular vote. Whether it's close in the electoral vote depends on what happens in a dozen states that could go either way.

Predict Florida for me. Predict Pennsylvania and Michigan. 
I think Gore will win Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan. I've always thought Gore would win Florida. We worked like crazy there for eight years. And we've done a lot for Florida, and a lot with Florida — and Joe Lieberman has helped a lot in Florida. So I think Gore will win Florida.

*** 
{Final Thoughts}

What have you learned about the American people? You've had a unique exposure to them that nobody else has ever had. 
I'll tell you this: When I leave office on January 20th, I will leave even more idealistic than I was the day I took the oath of office, eight years earlier.

The American people are fundamentally good, and they almost always get it right, if they have enough time and enough information. But the biggest problem we have in public discourse today is, there's plenty of information out there, but you don't know what's true and what's not, and it's hard to access it. It's all kind of flying at you at once. It's hard to have time to digest it. But if people have the information, they have time to digest it, they nearly always get it right. And if that weren't the case, we wouldn't be around here after 224 years.

Do you have any special message to young people? Any valedictory thoughts to the kids in school right now as you leave office? 
First of all, I think that they should realize that they're very fortunate to be living in this country at this time. Fortunate because of our economic prosperity, fortunate because of our enormous diversity and fortunate because of the permeation of technology in our society. All of which enables us to relate to the rest of the world and to one another in different and better ways.

Secondly, I think they should understand that our future success is not guaranteed — and it depends on their interest in public affairs as well as their private lives — and their participation.

One of the things that's really concerned me about this election is all these articles that say that young people think there's not much in it for them. I think maybe that's because there's been a lot of debate about Social Security and Medicare. They think that's just an old-folks issue.

The Social Security issue is a youth issue. Why? Because when all of us baby boomers retire — and I'm the oldest of the baby boomers, people between the ages now of fifty four and thirty-six — there will only be two people working for every one person drawing Social Security.

There are all these other issues that concern young people in this election. We have to build a clean-energy future to avoid global warming. There are two stunning studies that have come out in the last month: One, the analysis of the polar ice cap, says that the 1990s was the warmest decade in a thousand years. The other, a projecting study, estimates that if we don't change our greenhouse-gas emissions, the climate will warm between 2.4 and 10 degrees over the next century. Two-point-four is too much; 10 degrees would flood a lot of Louisiana and Florida. This is a very serious thing.

Then you've got this incredible scientific-technological revolution. If you just take the human genome alone, a lot of the young people in America today, when they have their children, they'll get a little gene card to take home with them from the hospital. And their children will be born with a life expectancy of 90 years.

This is a fascinating time to be alive, but it's not free of challenges. So I would say to the young people: You'll probably live in the most prosperous, interesting time in human history. But there are a lot of big challenges out there, and you'll have to be public citizens as well as private people.

e joined the vice presidential motorcade on a ninety-degree September morning in Silicon Valley, where a sweating Al Gore headlined a campaign rally at a small suburban park in Sunnyvale, a marathon of hand-shaking, baby-kissing and disciplined salesmanship. A couple of hours later, we were off to Moffett Federal Airfield, an overscaled military base with runways long enough for the space shuttle to land and hangars so big, they seemed a part of some other civilization. Within minutes we were airborne, en route back to Washington.

Air Force Two bears few traces of luxury or personality. The traveling press sits in the back of the plane. There are 20 roomy seats and electrical outlets for your laptop. In a campaign as insistently on-message as Gore's, it seems only fitting that the first meal served is a bowl of Wheaties. Once the plane hits cruising speed, the Secret Service agents — large, calm guys (and one woman) who really do wear bad suits — take off their jackets. When they brush by you walking down the aisle, their big, black handguns are right at eye level: a strange but somehow comforting sight. The military attache, an attractive Air Force major radiating cheerful authority in her well-pressed uniform, carries a bulky, black nylon briefcase wherever she goes: "the football," which contains the codes for launching nuclear war.

The campaign staffers sit in the middle of the plane, in seats that face one another around tables. In contrast to the Secret Service agents, they are skinny, wired and young — the smartest kids in your high school class. Gore's best friend and brother-in-law, Frank Hunger, a silvery Southern gent with a handshake like old, good leather, moves easily between the staff area and Gore's private cabin, which is at the front of the plane. It's hard to tell exactly what Hunger does here, other than provide balance: "Everything's just more relaxed when Uncle Frank's around," says one young press aide.

Two hours after liftoff, a markedly relaxed Al Gore welcomes us into his cabin at the front of the plane. The cabin is hardly lavish. It's outfitted with a fold-out couch, a desk and a couple of swivel chairs. The pared-down informality reflects the mood of the campaign. You get the feeling that a Gore White House will be one endless casual Friday — the kind of place where people come to work in their recreational clothes because they know that's the closest they'll get to actually getting out and having fun.

The vice president had been wearing cowboy boots for his public appearances. Now he's traded them in for a pair of quilted slippers  — the type you'd buy in a sporting-goods store. Next to the couch sits a bulging Eagle Creek backpack, all straps and buckles.

Our interview begins promptly. There is little small talk or chitchat. Gore is attentive and friendly and answers our questions with a thoroughness that is almost wearying. His speech is a marvel of dependent clauses that roll down the tracks of his thoughts like fully loaded freight cars. If you interrupt him, he will hit the mental PAUSE button and, once you are done, will pick up exactly where he left off. A little less than two hours later, as the plane begins its descent into Edwards Air Force Base, Gore signals the end of the first portion of the interview by taking out his Palm Pilot and checking his email.

Gore is a man whose view of the world seems to have been as equally formed by listening to Bob Dylan songs as by reading dense policy reports. At one point, we ask him to take apart the lyrics of "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)," which contains his favorite Dylan line: "He not busy being born is busy dying." When we get to the line, "But even the president of the United States must have to stand naked," Gore smiles and interprets it for us: "The president of the United States is a human being  an ordinary person put into an extraordinary job. And sometimes that person must stand apart from all the trappings, illusions and perquisites, and all the authority, and be seen as a person  for who he or she is." Exactly. —W.D.

What are the most fun parts of the campaign?
I'm not really a natural politician, in the sense of backslapping and constantly calculating the political import of this or that. It takes me awhile to get into a campaign; it's as if I need a longer runway to get airborne. But once I get liftoff, I just feel a great thrill in getting up and speaking. Meeting in small groups, shaking hands, working the crowd, whatever it is. I really love it.

Was there a moment when you felt you hit your stride in this campaign?
In the primaries, it came in late August of '99, after I came back from climbing Mount Rainier with my son. And being completely away from the race for three days and nights — concentrating basically on survival, because I'm not a very good mountain climber — cleared my mind.

And I realized: Running for president is a hell of a lot different than speaking as a vice president, where you are constantly mindful of how to push the administration's agenda forward. I realized that I had to have a direct emotional contact between me and the American people. That may sound elementary, but it was a shift that was slow in coming. Once it came, I began to hit my stride.

After the primaries I think I hit a lull, during which my opponent tried to change a lot of his postures and positions. As a result, we didn't do very well right in the period after Super Tuesday. But then I began to get back into my stride. And I'm not sure I can give you an exact moment the second time, but I know I began to feel it about four weeks before the convention.

Before the Democratic convention, Bush was far ahead in the polls and was looking pretty hard to beat. But after you made your acceptance speech, you vaulted right over him. What do you make of that bounce?
In this case, "bounce" is a metaphor that conceals more than it reveals. "Bounce" implies a temporary rise that, by the force of gravity, comes back down. I think that another metaphor is probably more explanatory: I think that I went into the convention with some ballast that was holding me below water. I always thought it would change at the convention.

What was the ballast?
The fact that people perceived me primarily in terms of my role as vice president. And after eight years of seeing me standing behind the president — motionless, silent — ... in a quintessential second-banana role, many felt I was asking a lot of them to hear me speak in a presidential voice and to define myself as an aspirant for the number-one position. And journalists, in a good-faith effort to interpret the reality that they report every day, had a similar challenge.

All the stories about reinvention, about me changing my image, trying to be something I'm not — all of those were superficial manifestations of the deeper perception of many in the press corps: They knew me in the role of vice president, and here I was being presented to them as somebody speaking as a would-be president.

But, inevitably, at convention time, you have a unique chance to step out on your own and be seen for who you really are. And that's why I was determined to say, as I did in the speech: "I stand here before you as my own man." And that cut the rope tying me to the ballast — and I've floated toward the top. And now you see them, on the other side, desperately trying to tie ballast back to me. And it doesn't work.

There was something special about that speech.
It was directly from my heart. I got some help on it, but I wrote it myself.

You were so plain-spoken.
That's the way I am when I write. If you read the eulogy that I gave for my father or the speech that I made at Ebenezer Church on Martin Luther King Day a few years ago or some of the other speeches that I've really taken the time to write myself, you'll hear the same voice, and the same plain-spoken approach, because that's all I know how to do.

One other factor: The convention was preceded by my decision to ask Joe Lieberman to be my running mate. And there was a magic about that combination that is hard to describe. There was a huge release of energy that came with that, that I didn't know would come. I knew it was the right thing to do. I just trusted my gut. I knew that there were a lot of unknowns. It was a leap off a cliff, in a sense. But I hoped there'd be a pool of clear, deep water to land in — and, sure enough, there was.

It was most comparable, really, to the excitement generated by Clinton picking you. In terms of doing something imaginative, different and from the heart. 
Actually, it hit people in much the same way… . And, if we're successful, Joe will have a similarly expansive interpretation of the true significance of my picking him [laughs].

What do you do to relax on the campaign trail?
I do interviews with journalists who can ask in-depth questions.... 

No, I like to watch movies; I like to exercise; I like to hang out with my family; I like to have a beer with Frank Hunger — my best friend and brother-in-law. I like to go for long walks, read books. What books have you read lately?
I read a really interesting book called Jonah: The Anatomy of the Soul, by Stephen Goldberg. It's not for everybody. And I really liked The Marriage of Sense and Soul — Ken Wilber. It's an examination of how to reconcile science and religion. I really enjoyed The First World War, by the military historian John Keegan.

Do you read any lighter stuff?
Sometimes. Not lately… . I like movies a lot. I watch more movies than I read books.


What's in your top five from the past year?

Being John Malkovich; East Is East; Shall We Dance? I liked Gladiator a lot — I thought that was an excellent movie. I loved The Matrix. I loved the metaphor. Somebody gigged me in the mainstream media for not liking too much violence in the movies but simultaneously liking that movie. Well, you know, it was rated for adults. It was very violent, but it was a terrific movie. And I can hardly wait for the sequel.

Gladiator was very violent, too.

A brilliant movie. I also liked Erin Brockovich. I thought that was a fascinating movie. I also liked Three Kings. I thought both of those were under-appreciated by the reviewers. Every once in a while you'll find a movie that gets somewhere between good and lukewarm reviews, and you see it for yourself, and it's just a knockout. Usually it's the opposite experience. You get all these puffy blurbs, and then you see it and you think, "Well, it's OK, but not that good.”

I liked the one about the guy who went cross-country on a tractor to reconcile with his brother, The Straight Story. I thought that was cool.

This year marks the twentieth anniversary of John Lennon's death. In the same issue this interview will appear in, we're asking a bunch of musicians where they were when they heard the news that he was shot. Do you remember that night?
I was at home, in Arlington, Virginia, and it was just devastating. Because it was not only the loss of a great man, it was the loss of a true genius. And I have to say that I'm sure that I'm not the only one who felt the loss of all the music that he had yet to write. The loss of any chance the Beatles would come back together and bring us a new sensibility, from the standpoint of that incredible gestalt that they had. I thought of the senseless violence in our society, and the ease with which people who obviously shouldn't have access to guns can get them.

They're your favorite group, right?
Oh, yeah. They had something almost impossible to describe. I went to their first concert in Washington, D.C., which was on their first tour. I remember the night they were on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” I was about 14. And the next day, something had changed. There was not only a new sound, there was something else that was new.

What are your favorite Beatles records?
I guess Rubber Soul is my favorite album. I just think that it's an amazing album. I loved Sgt. Pepper, the White Album. Sgt. Pepper was a real tour de force. I'm not enough of a music historian to know whether this is accurate or not, but from my limited knowledge, it seemed to me to be the first time that an album had an integral quality that made it a whole piece of work from beginning to end.

Were you the type of kid who, when a record came out, you had to go down to the store and buy it that day? Oh, yeah, and then I would sit down with my headphones on and listen to it from the very first note to the very last note, several times. 

Who's your favorite Beatle?
John Lennon.

In the last couple of weeks, both you and Gov. Bush have appeared on "Oprah." Now David Letterman has suggested that you both go on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" How much money do you think he'll win? How far will he get?
Who?

Your opponent.
On that show? Oh, I have no idea. I'm not going to take that bait… . He's already a millionaire [laughs].

You live in this climate now where everything that you do is controlled — for access, image, what you stand in front of, what you say, where you appear. It seems like a really isolated environment. How do you stay normal?
First and foremost, Tipper keeps my shoes nailed to the floor so that I don't lose touch with gravity. She's my bellwether. And there's no way to live with her and not remain in close touch with what life's really all about, because she's got a heart with perfect pitch. Secondly, I've got really good friends that I hang out with and whom I call on the telephone from the road, just to touch base with and get my reality checks from.

Are most of your good friends in the political world?
No, no. They're guys I grew up with, guys I was in Vietnam with, guys I was in the Army in Alabama with, guys I was in school with.

What do you think Ralph Nader's candidacy is contributing, if anything, to this year's political conversation?
Well, I think that it's likely that most people, before the end of the campaign, will want to make a choice between the candidates that are most likely to be in contention.

But do you think his candidacy contributes anything to the dialogue? Obviously, what he has to say represents a point of view closer to yours than George Bush's.
Whenever that subject comes up, it usually comes to my attention in the form of somebody who says that they like what they hear him saying about X or Y, but they really don't like what he's saying about several other things. Or I hear people say, "Well, I liked what he said about this, but I'm supporting you because I think you can really win and get something done about it.”

I also hear people say that it seems disingenuous for him to claim that it doesn't matter who appoints the next three justices of the Supreme Court. Most people think that it does matter — because a woman's right to choose, civil rights, disability rights, antitrust law, environmental law all hang in the balance. And the majority appointed by the next president will interpret the Constitution for the next 30 to 40 years. And the argument that it just doesn't make any difference whether I appoint three justices, or whether Bush appoints them — with the concurrence of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson — is an argument that I think most people reject.

Have you ever met George W. Bush?
Yes, but never for more than a brief exchange: "Hi, how are you?" I saw him at one of the governors' meetings when he came to the White House, and I saw him at an all-star game when he was a baseball owner. That's about it.

What do you think of him?
I don't know him well enough to have a judgment about him. And I'm leery of going on the cartoon image that I get from the news media.


What do you think of the campaign he's running?
[Pause] I don't know yet. Nietzsche once said, "The end of a thing is its nature.”

Is that your final answer?
Since I don't have a lifeline, yes.
What did you actually have to do with the creation of the Internet?
In my first term in Congress — I was elected in 1976 — I began a series of meetings, under the rubric of a group called the Congressional Clearinghouse on the Future, between interested members of Congress and computer scientists, geneticists, futurists and others. It became apparent that the juice was in the information revolution. Computer-processing power was doubling every year and a half, but the transmission lines for information were still based on twisted copper. The number of bits per second was static, and it wasn't increasing; meanwhile, processing power was expanding geometrically, logarithmically, explosively.

That had particular significance for me, because, when I was 10, my father, who was the author of the Interstate Highway bill, often took me to the meetings of his committee that designed the interstate-highway system. And he often explained why it was such a major project for him. Our family used to drive back and forth, six or seven times a year, between Carthage, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C., on two-lane roads. I remember going from Carthage to Nashville at nighttime, on old Highway 70, and seeing a long line of red taillights stretching out for miles and miles and miles.

Years later, that analogy jumped out at me. Just as the proliferation of cars and trucks after World War II made the two-lane roads obsolete, the proliferation of personal computers and the growth of processing power — in the wake of the Apollo program — made the old two-lane information pathways obsolete. At least, prospectively obsolete. And in short order.

Did you imagine back then that there'd one day be a consumer use for the Internet?
Oh, yes. And I began evangelizing the idea of an information superhighway. There were a lot of others who did the work, who came up with the discoveries. And I never said I invented the Internet. But where the congressional role was concerned, I did take the lead. And I went beyond having hearings — I introduced legislation. I pushed big increases in the funding for research into how to expand the capacity of fiber-optic cable, how to develop super-computers that were more powerful, how to develop the right switches and algorithms to handle the information flow. I went to talk with people who had the early networks — like DARPAnet, which was a tiny little Defense Department network on which the first e-messaging — they didn't have the term e-mail yet — was taking place.

I wrote a piece of legislation to establish something called NREN: the National Research Education Network. The idea behind it was to create large supercomputing centers, which didn't exist then — research centers that had leading-edge computer capacity — and then to link them with high-volume data links as a demonstration project to show what could happen.

In doing this, I went back and studied Congress' role in the development of the telegraph. Do you know the story of Samuel Morse? He was a portrait painter, and he was painting a portrait in the White House of President Franklin Pierce. And his wife, back in Virginia — later to be West Virginia — fell ill and, over a two-week period, died. The word did not get to him, because it had to come by horseback. Had he known, he would have been by his wife's side. He was consumed with guilt, as well as grief, and he thought, as an artist, "What could I do to make sure that nobody else feels this pain that I feel?" And he invented the telegraph. Anyway, the government's role was to build this demonstration line between Washington and Baltimore.

The NREN was a demonstration of what could be done. I always felt that once the capacity was demonstrated, it would grow out from the backbone, as other people wanted it. I also introduced the Super Computer Network Study Act, which created the laboratory where Marc Andreeson developed the first graphic Web browser.

Most people didn't see the sense in this, because they had no experience with what the transmission of computerized data meant. I met with the last chairman of AT&T before it was dismantled — a guy named Charles Brown — and I tried to sell him on the idea of a project to vastly expand the information networks to handle this new computing. Mr. Brown had zero interest in this. More to the point, he had negative interest.

What about campaign-finance reform? If you actually look closely at the accusations made against you in the Buddhist-temple fund-raising controversy, they are really very technical.
First of all, I've acknowledged that I made a mistake by going there. Everybody knows that we need a new campaign financing system. I'm for full public financing. That has been my position for twenty-four years. When I was a young congressman from a rural district of middle Tennessee, I advocated, over and over again, full public financing of all congressional House and Senate elections.

So where are you putting that in your priority list?
The McCain-Feingold bill will be the very first bill I send to the Congress. I would prefer to tackle the larger public-finance initiative, but most of my allies in the campaign-finance-reform battle feel that the best is the enemy of the better and that it's only realistic to try to get McCain-Feingold first. And since they've worked so hard on this, I bow to their judgment. But I want to follow it up.

That would make you the first president ever to advocate full public financing?
I think so, but I don't know the answer to that.

You're an important adviser to President Clinton. If you win the election, will you be asking him for advice?
Well, I'm certain that we'll remain friends all our lives. And if there's some subject where I think the country could benefit from having his advice given, then I, of course, wouldn't hesitate to call him. Same with Jimmy Carter; same with President Ford; same with President Bush. But, you know, it would depend on the issue. He's got a lot of plans for what he wants to do.


Did you ever think that there was a point, during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment process, that you would become president ahead of schedule?
You mean, that he would have to resign? No, I never thought that. My duty was to the country. And during a time of stress involving the possibility of a change in the presidency, the absolute worst thing that I could have done would have been to pile on, or appear to be trying to aid the forces attempting to push him out of office. 

This was a very complicated, nuanced situation. There was no black-and-white. What was going through your mind?
Well, my relationship with the president has basically four parts to it. Number one, he's my friend, and the friendship is genuine. And it's important to both of us. Number two, I was disappointed, very deeply, by what he did; condemned it; said it was indefensible. Had the same reaction that most people had. Number three, I have worked alongside Bill Clinton in winning a lot of battles on behalf of the American people. And I'm proud of our accomplishments. Number four, I'm running for president on my own.

Now, at any given time during the last couple of years, depending upon the question that was asked, the questioner might hear one or two of those four elements and not absorb all of them. Because human relationships are complex, and journalism often puts a premium on simplification. If I said, "I'm running on my own," some would say, "Oh, he's distancing himself from the president." Then they would hear me say, "He's my friend," and they would think, "Oh, now he's reversed course and is embracing him." Nothing of the sort. All four elements are continuously present in the relationship. And, yet, the fact that everything about that was charged with 10,000 volts, and whoever touched it got a zap from it, made it very difficult to deal with. For anybody, much less somebody in my position.

You've been described as the most influential vice president in American history. In what areas do you think you made a difference?

I defined my role as vice president in a very simple way: I wanted to serve my country by doing whatever I could to help Bill Clinton be the best president he could possibly be. And that meant doing different things at different times. It meant giving him advice on how to approach the job personally; it meant being a sounding board for him on every important decision that he made; it meant strengthening his hand in meetings, where we'd do a good cop-bad cop routine. Like with Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey and Trent Lott. Or with foreign leaders.

It also meant taking special responsibility for certain issue areas where he asked me to play the lead role. And among those I would cite environmental policy, science and technology policy, information policy, Russia policy, Ukraine policy, Egypt policy, South Africa policy, reinventing government, the community-empowerment board, crime prevention, space policy… . What am I leaving out? Oh, the Caspian Oil Pipeline, the Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996, empowerment zones.

Of all those things, what accomplishments are you most proud of?
Getting an agreement at Kyoto, Japan, on global warming — which provides the foundation for bold action in the years ahead. Casting the tie-breaking vote on the new economic plan, which reversed course on economic policy and helped to produce the prosperity we have. Reducing the size of the federal work force by 360,000 people — more than ever in history — through the reinventing-government program and beginning the process of real reform in government.

You hear this phrase "reinventing government" a lot. What exactly does it mean, and why is it so important?
Government is, in many ways, the last institution in our society to undergo the kind of change that corporations and nonprofits have gone through. The new techniques of the information age — the management revolution, human relations — have barely scratched the surface in the way government operates. I want to move most government services onto the World Wide Web. I want people to be able to contact any service provided by the U.S. government and come away from the experience thinking: "Wow, that was really good." And, you know, we can do that. It sounds far-fetched, but it's really not. It can be done.

For eight years I've led this reinventing-government effort, and I know where the rats in the barn are. I know where the bodies are buried. Let me use a different metaphor: I know where the bureaucratic waste is. And my biggest allies have been federal employees, who are sick to death of it. You know, the men and women in the lower ranks of federal employees can give you a Ph.D. in an afternoon on how to shake up and transform this government.

What do you think you've learned about yourself during the last eight years?
I've learned a lot about the decision-making process — when the stakes are high and the pressure's on. One of the biggest surprises for me was a mundane recognition that might seem obvious: The decisions that make it to the Oval Office are the ones that haven't been picked off by somebody down the ladder, the ones that nobody else can figure out how to resolve — so they're all tough. 
The second realization was — and this is hard to describe, until you see it — the tough decisions actually come in clusters, in squadrons, in flotillas. And it's uncanny.

Normally in your life, if you've got a real bet-the-farm decision, you work through it. You take your time. You gather all the facts, and you finally get to the result you think is right. And then you feel a sense of relief. You kick back and relax a little bit.

Not in the Oval Office. Because, usually, when you get to that point, and you've made the decision, there are a couple more circling the office, waiting to land on the desk. And it's one right after another. You can have a huge foreign-policy crisis, and, right in the middle of it, two domestic-policy crises break down the door on their way in. And you're dealing with them all simultaneously. It's hard to describe.

But, having been through it for eight years now, I recognize the pattern. And making decisions of that kind is a little bit like working out with a Nautilus machine. When you start, you get sore. But if you keep it up on a regular basis, you build up your muscles. I think there's the equivalent of decision-making muscles, and they get stronger the more you use them.


Speaking of tough decisions, one of the first things to cross the next president's desk will be the National Missile Defense program, which has now been specifically deferred to the next administration. Here's where we're at with the program: The first tests of the technology have failed; the scientific community says it's unfeasible; and if we go ahead with the program, it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, with no assurances that it will ever work. Are you going to put an end to this nonsense?
If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I'm going to proceed with the testing program, to evaluate the limited defensive system that has thus far not passed the test. At the same time, I will attempt to convince our allies of why we should be concerned about the possibility of a rogue state, like North Korea or Iran or Iraq, acquiring a small arsenal of ICBMs with nuclear warheads — and why it's in our interest, if that occurs, to be able to protect the country against the blackmail that would accompany possession of such an arsenal. And, simultaneously, I'd work with Russia and China to explain to them why they need not fear this. And, indeed, to invite them to participate.

Which way would you like to see it go?
I'd like to see arms control work, but not with any illusions. It's not impossible that the diplomatic and political developments now underway in North Korea and in Iran could lead to a different sort of solution to the problem. But if these nations developed nuclear arsenals, and if this system is proved to work, objections on the part of the Russians will not be a sufficient reason for me not to approve it.

What's your opinion of Russian President Vladimir Putin? How do you feel it's likely to go with him?
The jury is still out. I first met him when he was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. He's obviously a smart man; he's obviously a good politician. His deepest heart on reform is not yet fully decipherable. I'm troubled by the actions he's taken against the free press in Moscow. Other steps he's taken are cause for good feelings. So the record, so far, is mixed. The very fact that he has the confidence of the Russian people is itself a good and stabilizing development, and there's no question that the Russian economy is beginning to improve significantly — and thereby give people more of a stake in continuing and accelerating the reform process.

What does he need to do right away?
You really cannot have a successful economy in the information age with repression of free speech. There are different models around the world, and some appear to work for a short period of time. But only the coupling of political and economic freedom will provide sustained prosperity and freedom over an extended period.
What about Africa? The whole continent seems to be in deep trouble — AIDS, civil war, poverty. How are we going to help those countries?
With trade, and aid, and intensive involvement. The future of the world depends, more than many realize, on the healing of Africa's place in the world. It's the big missing piece. Just as the emergence of Latin America over the last few decades resulted in the fastest-growing markets for the U.S. economy, so the emergence of Africa in the next decade can lift the world economy to new heights. The potential is vast, but the problems are daunting. We have to avoid what is called "Afro-pessimism." Because for every horror story — and there are lots of 'em — there are also less prominent success stories.

One of them is Nigeria, the largest country on the continent. We saw the transformation of South Africa. With Olusegun Obasanjo's government in Nigeria, we now have the possibility of an emerging-market democracy in the heart of the continent. We have seen a success story in Uganda against the AIDS epidemic, which may be replicated elsewhere. We have staved off the famine in the horn of Africa this year — largely with U.S. aid. We're seeing some progress elsewhere.

Now, the problem areas are Congo-Kinshasa — where the civil war has mutated into eight or nine simultaneous subregional civil wars. The movement toward stability in the Great Lakes region is proceeding very slowly, with Burundi making some progress in the wake of the Clinton-Mandela intervention. Rwanda's President Paul Kugame is beginning to play a more constructive role. Yoweri Museveni is pledging cooperation in Uganda. We're seeing some improvement in the cross-border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Congo-Brazzaville, the other Congo, is emerging from its domestic strife.

The problems are so deep. How much money will it cost the United States to set things right in Africa?
We should pursue multilateral debt relief, but trade will ultimately play a larger role than aid. It's not just a question of money. It's also a question of institutions. They have to get the basics right. There has to be rule of law. There has to be a capacity to put legal and accounting systems in place, reform of markets. 

Again, I'm an optimist on Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa is going to emerge, in this decade and the next, to move toward full partnership in the global economy.

How do we shape our relationship with China?
China is one of the keys to the future of our world. It has such a large population and such a large economy and such a deep and broad pool of talented people. It's going to be a force in every sphere.

Opening the world market to China's participation on fair terms is an important first step. One of the most important features of the trade normalization agreement that was just reached has to do with the Internet. The openness of the Internet will lead to a very profound social and political transformation in China.

There are now regular demonstrations taking place in China, over social and political injustices, that never happened before. The Fulan Gong phenomenon is one of several movements — it's the biggest and most prominent — that would not have been possible without people feeling a degree of freedom to associate, even when they're persecuted. There have been more than 10,000 village elections in China — most of them free, according to the Carter Center. They have postponed the planned step to take it up from the village level to the equivalent of our country level, but that's probably coming.


Do you know this much about everything?
Well, I've been lucky in what you've asked me about.... I'll tell you, one of the things that has been a great learning experience for me as vice president is that I spend at least a half an hour every single morning reading through the intelligence briefings from around the world that are organized for me by the CIA. And it's like anything else. If you do it every single day, you end up learning something.

How do we handle the ongoing tensions with the Chinese government?

Well, we have to keep perfect pitch where the Beijing-Taipei relationship is concerned. We have to be true to our core values and continue insisting, strongly, that human rights and religious and political freedoms be respected. We have to continue working with them on the full range of issues in the bilateral relationship and wait for the democratizing aspects of free markets — and the liberating influences of the Internet — to work.

I co-chair a binational commission with Zhu Rongji — who's the prime minister of China — on the environment and sustainable development. I went over there, to the Great Hall of the People, and gave them a long presentation on global warming. People who know me and who know how obsessed I am with trying to confront this issue — and have seen me give my presentation to anyone who'll sit for it — will not be surprised to know I gave it there.

They were very polite and listened to it. I found that there were incredibly smart scientists there who knew the straight story on global warming and are trying to convince others in China to wake up and do something about it. They have a huge crisis with water in China, and, under Zhu Rongji, they are beginning to take on problems of pollution in a very serious way. And they have a massive reforestation program that will soon be the largest in the world.

What's your take on Colombia? To some enormous degree, the country is controlled by drug traffickers. It is torn by civil war and seems to be falling apart before our eyes. And now, the Clinton administration has just announced that we will be sending them $1.5 billion in military aid. Are we going to have to send in troops?
Well, Colombians themselves will decide the future of Colombia. But we are actively helping the freely elected government, chosen by the people of Colombia, in its effort to deal with narco-terrorism and control the excesses on both sides.

A lot of people are drawing analogies to Vietnam.
I think it's a false analogy. We have a chance to help the good guys prevail. You know, Mark Twain once wrote, "A cat burned on a hot stove won't sit on a hot stove again — but he won't sit on a cold one, either." 

[At this point, we land at Edwards Air Force Base, outside Washington, D.C. The vice president offers to continue the interview aboard Marine One, the famous helicopter often seen taking off from and landing on the White House lawn, that will take him back into Washington, D.C. There is a short delay while he changes into a tuxedo. A few minutes later we are airborne again. Gore's entourage has been severely whittled down by now. The press corps and most of the campaign staff have been loaded into vans. We are accompanied by two Secret Service agents; an aide who briefs him on his next appearance — a speech before the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; and the ever-present military attache carrying the football. Hanging on the wall is a framed eight-by-ten glossy of Bill Clinton. Once aboard, Gore directs me to his seat, which is located in the center of the cabin, by the biggest window.]

You said earlier that helping to draft the Kyoto Accords was your proudest accomplishment as vice president. And yet the Senate will not even debate the treaty, let alone ratify it. Why not?
Well, if it was debated now, the debate would lead quickly to a vote.

And it would be defeated?
Right. There wouldn't be enough votes to justify bringing it up. But public opinion is going to change that. I mean, last month we got a new study showing that within fifty years, the North Pole is going to be completely melted in the summertime. And the effect this has on climate change is just staggering. While some of the precise impacts are beyond the powers of supercomputers to predict, there's simply no question about the fact that the changes are extremely harmful and costly.

But that doesn't get the Senate to start debating the Kyoto treaty.
When the people of this country hear Mother Nature knocking on the door more insistently each year, at some point very soon we're going to cross a threshold beyond which they start demanding that the Senate act, and that the entire Congress act.

If you are president, will the treaty come up for debate? Will you use the power you have to force the passage of this treaty?
Yes. But it's going to be a race for public opinion. Because the only way the Senate's going to turn around is with a big change in public opinion. And I want to focus that opinion.

Are you prepared to get up there and lead the charge?

Oh, yes, of course.

You're prepared to go up there and twist these Senators' arms?
Of course. Of course. That's one of the main reasons I'm running for president. [The vice president interrupts himself, signaling that this portion of the interview is over. There are sights to take in — in this case, the stunning, floodlit grandeur of the capital city at night. Gore points to the Washington Monument, which, until recently, had been wrapped in scaffolding while undergoing an extensive renovation.]

Is it more luminescent since the overhaul?
A little bit.... Some people are kinda sorry to see the scaffolding taken down. 


I liked the scaffolding. It was like Christo — you know, the guy that wraps things? I'm a fan of his work.
Oh, me, too! Me, too! He's one of my favorite artists. He's just fabulous. We know him and his wife, and she's an integral part of his.... I took a project, an idea, to him. I found out, unfortunately, that he does not take any ideas from anyone else. You know, there's some artists who have a special relationship with a muse that — I mean, they're monogamous with the muse. [Laughter] They will not allow anybody else to contribute an idea. And he's that way.

But here's my idea, just so you'll know it. You've been to Moscow?

Yeah.
You know those seven huge buildings that are all identical, that Stalin built? One's a hotel, one's the foreign ministry. It looks like a wedding-cake building. Pay attention the next time you're there to this particular style. There are seven of them. Stalin liked the first one so much, he told them to build six more just like it. And they dominate the landscape in Moscow.

Well, I thought it would be a cool idea, if Christo could raise the money — easy for me to say. But I thought it would be a cool idea to drape all seven of them in a different pastel color. Just as a revolutionary act. [A few minutes later, we land by the Reflecting Pool just south of the White House, and Gore speeds off in his motorcade to his back aboard Air Force Two, this time en route from Andrews Air Force Base to Chicago. It's a Saturday afternoon and altogether more relaxed.]

What was going to Vietnam like? You had been against the war but volunteered anyway. It must have been pretty wild to go there as a twenty-two-year-old.

Yeah, it was. I was based about forty-five minutes away from Saigon, and I spent most of my time traveling in the country. My orders allowed me to hitchhike on any helicopter or fixed-wing plane that had an empty seat. I went over there as an opponent of the war, but in retrospect, it's now obvious that both the pro-war and anti-war opinions were wrong in many respects. Those of us against the war were wrong in believing that the Viet Cong were this indigenous revolutionary force trying to rid the country of foreign domination. They were a complete tool of the North Vietnam army the entire time. But the pro-war types were wrong in failing to see the extent to which anti-colonialism was really a very big part of the reason for the sentiment in the North and among those in the South who sympathized.

How did your time there change you, personally?
Oh, I grew up a lot. I lump it together a lot with my two years in the Army. I had what was, in many ways, a privileged upbringing. And as an enlisted man, I was thrown in with kids from every conceivable background. For many generations, our country had the benefit of the homogenizing, democratizing force known as Universal Military Service — the draft. And, you know, though the volunteer Army is a success, I think we lost something with that. 
I did not see combat. And I didn't do the most, or run the greatest risk, and I don't want to leave that impression. But there is, nevertheless, a vividness in a war zone that is unlike anything else that you experience. You're constantly aware of a certain background level of danger that's, in some ways, intoxicating.
I was like a lot of guys in that when I came back from Vietnam, I had this pull to go back over there. It's hard to explain. But if you talk to Vietnam veterans, you'll find this as a recurring theme. You come back home, and life is not as vivid. And maybe for that reason — maybe because it was an unfinished experience. You know, you get in a war, you want to win a war. I mean, not that I had a bayonet in my teeth — I certainly did not. But I found it quite a growth experience.
You wrote "Earth in the Balance" nearly ten years ago now. It has to be the most thoughtful, well-researched book ever written by someone running for national office. And, in many ways, very radical. Has anything happened since you became vice president that has changed your views?
I stand behind it all. But I have to admit that I made a mistake in saying that we should transition out of the internal-combustion engine over a twenty-five-year period. We should do it much sooner than that [laughs]. And that's really the only change. You know, the science in the book has held up extremely well. They haven't really challenged, successfully challenged, any of the assertions or findings.
Tree reforestation has come under scrutiny as being not as successful a program as scientists once thought —

There are always these little tweaks. It's not — 
I was just trying to show a little knowledge there — 

What that study showed was that it's not as good as keeping the old forest. It still helps to sequester carbon. Do you know about my satellite? 

No, go ahead.
You remember the first picture you saw of the Earth from space? That had a huge impact, right? That picture was taken on December 11th, 1972, and it is the most published photograph in history. It's also the last picture of the Earth taken from space. If you see a picture of the Earth — in a newspaper or a magazine or an advertisement — it is that picture. I've got it blown up, massive size, on my office wall in the White House.

How can we get another one of those? I mean, how come we don't have more? Well, that was taken by the last Apollo flight. The orbiting satellites we have now are not far enough from the surface to get that perspective. They only see a part of the surface. That picture is so rare, because it's one of the few where the sun was directly behind the spacecraft, so the Earth is fully lit.

So I'm thinking, "How do we get more stuff like that?" And I did a little research, and I thought about it. And I actually had a dream one night and woke up in the middle of the night. My staff says never to talk about this, because it sounds ... it sounds a little ... Rod Serling. But I woke up at two o'clock in the morning. And I got on the Internet and went to a couple of sites and figured out how to do this.


The next morning, I called Dan Golden, who heads NASA, and went through it with them. There is a point in space, a little under a million miles away from the Earth — between the Earth and the sun — called the L-1 point, where the gravitational pull of the Earth and the gravitational pull of the sun are exactly equal.

And you put a satellite out there, and it stays there, between the Earth and the sun. And when the Earth goes around the sun, the satellite stays in between them. So it always is looking at the Earth, and the Earth is fully lit.

So what our country's going to do — the launch is scheduled for January — is put a little satellite on the space shuttle, put it into orbit — and then, with a little motor, putter out a million miles. Put a ten-inch telescopic lens on a color-television camera. Turn that sucker around and we'll have twenty-four-hour live color-television pictures of the Earth available on the Internet, worldwide, on any cable TV or TV outlet that wants to use 'em. If you want it as a screen saver on your desktop, you can have it. And it'll measure the net energy balance, gain and loss, for the first time. It'll have an instrument on the back end — this was not my idea, but it's a damn good one — to serve as an early-warning of solar flares ... solar storms that disrupt communications. And it'll give a constant view.

In the same way that the first photo created a revolution in thought, this will make it easier to focus our collective attention on what the hell's going on here.

One of things you talked about in the book was calling annual meetings with world leaders — like the G-7 meetings — to coordinate worldwide global-warming strategy. Is this something you plan to do near the beginning of your administration?
When I went to Kyoto, we got a breakthrough agreement. We got sidetracked after that on the Senate, but let me come back to the agreement. That agreement initiated a round of regular global meetings on global warming. They're at the subministerial and ministerial level, but there are regular meetings. The next one is going to be in November, I believe. And the run-up to it is going to coincide with the election this fall. There were some who wanted to postpone that until later so it wouldn't get mixed up with our election process. But I argued we should just go straight ahead. We can't waste a day on this.

The point of it is, there are already regular global meetings set up. And there are other regular head-of-state global meetings at which global warming can be added to the agenda. I will certainly insist on bringing it up at the global meetings of heads of state at every opportunity.

So why wouldn't you use your status as the most important leader in the world to focus, again, the attention of the heads of state in a plenipotentiary meeting on this issue?
I don't rule that out. It's just that I've learned enough to know that process matters. And when countries come to the table to discuss an important subject, they make more progress if their relevant scientists and bureaucrats have gone through a process to prepare.

Not to drive this into the ground, but would you contemplate such a thing as calling for a regular cycle of global warming summits, like the G-7 meetings?
I don't rule it out. You know, if I thought that would be the best way to do it, I'd have no hesitation whatsoever.

On the internal-combustion engine: You seem pretty motivated to get rid of it. What will it take to get the American car manufacturers to go along with this?
Oh, listen — they're ahead of the curve.

Well, what about the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, in which the federal government gave the Big Three automakers a couple billion dollars to develop a next-generation, fuel-efficient car? What the designers came up with was something technologically impressive — a diesel-hybrid engine — that has no chance of ever being a viable car that Detroit will be able to market.
Let me give you my perspective on it, OK? One of the first meetings I had after the election in '92 was with the Big Three. And they came in and argued for a massive tax on gasoline. Does that surprise you? It surprised me a little bit, too. But it doesn't anymore, because I know much more about how they think and where their heads are really at. There are a lot of good people in these companies. You oughta sit down with Billy Ford, or Harry Pierce at GM, or some of the others. It would really surprise you. They are anxious to build the cars of the future and sell them here and around the world. They face some real-world practical challenges.

I sat down and personally negotiated the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles — in a series of meetings with the Big Three in my office in the White House, at my home and in Detroit. And we set a goal. It was hard to get them to agree, but they finally did. And the goal was a car with the same comfort, the same affordability, the same market attractiveness — but a three-times increase in fuel efficiency.

They signed onto a goal that they had no idea how to reach. The diesel, and the hybrid that you referred to earlier, is an interim step. The step beyond that is fuel-cell cars. The waste stream, instead of being pollution, is water — clean water. And we're really close to that.

Do you have a timetable in mind?
The first fuel-cell bus will be sold to run on the streets of America next year. There are fuel-cell vehicles that will be sold within the next few years.


That are going to be cars that people will actually want to drive?
Yes. But, but — here's the but. When you're doing something new and you're making them in very small lots, the per-unit cost is higher. One of the keystones of my program is to have sizable tax credits to even out the cost. So that if you want to buy a fuel-cell car, you'll get a large tax credit that will make the cost of that car equal to what it would be if you bought one of the old kind. And then, as the demand increases and they build more of them, the price comes down.

But it goes beyond cars and trucks and buses. We've got to completely redo the old dirty power plants, and the boilers and the furnaces. I announced a massive program, in the midst of the campaign, to do this. And the utility industry came out, many of them, and endorsed it. Because they see the handwriting on the wall.

How far along would you like to be, in terms of percentage, in eliminating internal-combustion engines in the next four years?
Oh, it would be foolish to give a percentage. Change like this is not a linear change. You get to a threshold — you reach a so-called tipping point — and then you see dramatic change. You know, look at the Internet. When we went into the White House, there were fifty sites on the World Wide Web — five zero. Now millions upon millions — and the amount that it increases every day is incredible.

Now, if you had asked me in 1992, "By the end of your eight years as vice president, what percentage penetration in American homes for the Internet would you like to have?" You would have thought I was crazy if I gave you the number that it actually turned out to be. But we have a chance to do that and more with fuel cells, and with new technologies, to save energy and reduce pollution.

And you think the car companies will do this voluntarily — with some tax subsidies? How tough are you prepared to get if the automakers don't get in line?
Well, we have laws that require the reduction of emissions. You know, when you say voluntary — you know, it's not an either/or proposition. If you're positing the choice of passing a law requiring that cars be made a particular way, that's not going to happen. The better way to approach it is to find the momentum of the market forces and use them to our advantage. In a free society, there's a limit to the use of command-and-control mechanisms. Right now, partly because of the PNGV program, there is a massive cutthroat competition in the world auto market to develop fuel-cell cars. And they're all going up to this little company in Vancouver, Ballard Systems. GM's got its own indigenous development. The Japanese are coming in with their version. All over the developing world, there are crowded megacities with pollution levels far in excess of anything we have in the United States, with the possible exception of Texas — I'm kidding on the last remark. But in all of those cities, their leaders are experiencing demands for higher standards of living from people who are watching global television — and seeing the higher standards of living in the U.S. and Europe. And at the same time, their pollution overburden is a serious health crisis. So the market for new kinds of cars and trucks and furnaces and power plants is enormous! It's expected to be, like, $10 trillion in the early part of this new century — if somebody can come up with a better mousetrap. And if we give incentives to develop those technologies here, then the market incentives and the competition to reach those markets, are going to take over after that.

Would you elevate something like this to NASA-type status?
Sure.

Let me ask you to fast-forward to 2008. Your administration is ending. What do you hope you will have accomplished, and set in motion, by that time? What will be the big things that you'll like to have done 
Well, I would hope to see — I mean, first of all, my hubris alarm goes off when I get a question like that, and I want to couch my answer in all the appropriate qualifiers. But if I'm privileged to serve the American people as president, I would hope, at the end of my time — however many years — that I would have been able to ... see this country lead the world to embark on the path of solving this problem of global warming. I would hope to bring about truly revolutionary improvements in our public school system. I would hope to revolutionize the way our self-government operates, by cutting out as much of the nonsense as possible.

I'd want to see no American dying from colon cancer, lung cancer or prostate cancer, and I'd want to see a sharp drop in mortality from other cancers. I'd want to see a cure for diabetes and HIV-AIDS. I want to use the human genome, and the attendant revolution in genetics, to bring about the same kind of transformation in health care that we've seen in the information sciences.

What do you think are the differences in the types of the challenges young people face today, compared to when you were young?
The cloud thrown by Vietnam was different from anything they've got right now. The period of disillusionment that began with the assassinations and continued through Vietnam and Watergate, and Nixon, really has, in some ways, continued up until today. I don't think we've had a long enough period of uninterrupted healing to restore the natural buoyancy in the body politic.

Voter turnouts continue to decline. One of the challenges I am most eager to undertake is trying to change that. These kids today are more involved with charities and community service and social activism than we were. Our generation thinks of itself as unique in that regard.

The difference is, it hasn't yet translated into the kind of political involvement that we got into. And I hope that's changing. But I think that the level of cynicism about government has remained pretty high. It's improved a bit in the last several years. It hit its peak probably in '90, '91, '92 — and now it's started to come back a little bit.

How can government reconnect with youth?
By just shooting straight — and really trusting people with the unvarnished truth. Even if it's hard to hear. And if I have the chance, I plan to give it to 'em.

ight days after solidly winning the New Hampshire Democratic primary, Vice President Al Gore glides into a classroom in a Detroit elementary school with the assurance of a man trained to put the world at ease. All his movements seem to happen at the same speed, deliberate but still smooth, apparently self-conscious but still easy. Up close, the effect is neither wooden nor robotic. He seems like a man who enjoys a hard-won sense of casualness.

Through the run-up to the primary season, Gore, 51, was in deep trouble. His campaign was a non-starter: a numbing succession of dense policy and tone-deaf politics. Everywhere he looked, the news was bad. Polls suggested that Texas Gov. George W. Bush would trounce him in the general election. If he could even get that far. In his own party, Bill Bradley, the one-time basketball star and U.S. senator who holds himself above politics, attacked Gore as the embodiment of business as usual. Gore began to look less like a candidate who could extend the alchemy of President Clinton's extraordinary economic record and more like an underling trapped in the boss' shadow.

Gore reacted by changing his wardrobe, moving out of Washington and trading one set of high-priced consultants for another. Reporters mostly snickered, but the strategy worked. In the days since New Hampshire voters confirmed the political viability of the new Al Gore — the engaging, easily provoked scrapper who elbowed Bill Bradley out of the way — the vice president has been a study in constant political motion, ripping across the country to sell a hopeful vision of a green, wired, equal-opportunity future in which the economy booms and the Republican party as we know it becomes obsolete.

And now, while the nation attends to Bush's struggle for survival against Sen. John McCain, Gore has started to carry the vaunted "air of inevitability," that state of political grace where a candidate appears comfortably ahead and studiously avoids the kind of embarrassment that invites headlines and scrutiny. Today, Gore's schedule is packed with the kind of low-excitement events sure to flatter the faithful and keep the wolves at bay. This morning he announced a new education initiative. Later in the day he'll speak at a union rally in Dayton, Ohio. But first he takes the time to talk to Rolling Stone, granting his first extended interview since regaining frontrunner status.

Though it is a Wednesday afternoon, Gore is dressed the way important people dress on weekends: knit shirt made of fine wool, a blue blazer and trousers of the indeterminate brownish color that middle-aged men look best in. And cowboy boots, because he doesn't want anyone to think he's from Washington. Our conversation is wide-ranging and substantive, covering topics from the environment to the drug laws, from his distaste for the leadership of the NRA to his favorite Bob Dylan song ("Just Like a Woman"). In conversation, Gore seems not so much an eager-to-please candidate as an earnest, thoughtful man with a pastor's demeanor. Clearly used to being the smartest guy in the room, he's direct, animated, friendly, a light touch with a hint of sarcasm. But then, with alarming suddenness and little warning, he'll turn into a "politician." When it comes time to snap a picture, the vice president is shaking your hand and beaming at the lens before you are even aware of the camera.

Gore mentions Bill Bradley only once but takes aim at the rivals for the Republican nomination — easy target Bush and the surging McCain — making it clear that he is starting to look beyond this spring's fight for his party's nomination and setting his sights on the November election.

What kind of music do you listen to now?
I listen to all kinds of music, and I enjoy all kinds. We are eclectic in our taste. I like rock. I like country & western. What we end up listening to as much as anything now is, we put our satellite dish on HIT LIST and listen to the selections that they have of the new Top 40 songs. Then we'll look at the little description at the bottom of the screen, and Tipper will go out and buy the CDs of the ones that we like.

What's the latest one you bought?
Sister Hazel.

Who are your favorite artists?
Well, the Beatles are in a class by themselves ... for a lot of reasons. And Bob Dylan, John Mayall, Bonnie Raitt and k.d. lang.

Is it true you memorized the lyrics to Dylan's "Masters of War" when you were in college?
Oh, yeah. I knew virtually all of the Dylan oeuvre. I listened to every single song that he ever wrote. I think that he's just an incredible genius. Same with Hank Williams. Williams comes from my part of the country. I think Dylan himself has always believed that Hank Williams was one of the greatest American poets. But I think the two of them are really good. I think Tracy Chapman is really good also.

Do you have a favorite period of Dylan's — his folk stuff or his rock stuff or his later stuff?
I like it all, but I think that the addition of the new energy when he went electric on Highway 61 Revisited.

Blonde on Blonde?
Blonde on Blonde. "Just Like a Woman."

Do you play music at the office? 
Yes, but I haven't been in the office in a year. [Sings] "She aches just like a woman ..."

What do you think the impact of popular music as a whole has been on culture and society?
[Sings] "... But she breaks just like a little girl."

It's a liberating force. It is a voice for the nontraditional view. An outlet for marginalized voices. It's an avenue for new ways of seeing and understanding and hearing our world. It's magical. It opens people up in ways that words alone do not.

Do you listen to rap music?
Well, I listen to it. But I don't follow it in the sense that I have any expertise in it. I mean, I like Faith Evans; I guess she's sort of on the margins of the category. In the '98 campaign I started doing rap on the stump, including one time in the Bronx in Spanish, which was a lot of fun.

Do your kids listen to any music that you can't stand or find objectionable? 
I certainly hear pieces that I don't particularly care for. I don't put whole categories of music under a label like that. But there are pieces that I absolutely love. I can hear a new song and just fall in love with it right away; you just know it when you hear it. For example: This is not all that new, but Kim Richey did this song, "I'm Alright." You ever hear that? She's country, but you would love that song. It's an example of a lyric and a tune that will just catch you, and that happens to me all the time — I fall in love with a piece of music. But I surely hear a lot of things I don't particularly care for. Sometimes they'll grow on me, though.

Let's say you're president and somebody walks in with the news that a 14-year-old boy has killed 12 students at his high school. When they arrest him, it turns out that he has some violent video games at home and he listens to heavy-metal music. What would your reaction be when people started blaming the murders on video games and heavy metal?
I think we have to approach the problem holistically. We need policies that make it easier for parents to balance work and home, and to spend more quality time with their children. But the one thing all these tragedies have in common is guns. I think we need to get guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. I favor, and first proposed, a photo license ID for the purchase of new handguns. I have proposed what's called super-tracing to help track the guns.

We need more guidance counselors and psychologists. We need more mental-health treatment. I think we need to understand the importance of giving kids a sense of meaning in their lives — a conviction that their lives have purpose, that they're connected to caring families. And communities where they can fill their lives with positive, creative activities. Now, down the list, if you're making a list of the contributing cause, I think that vulnerable children can be influenced by an overdose of violent imagery.

Do you put it at the same relative level as the availability of guns? How would you rank the two? If you had a choice, as president, to use your powers and resources to focus on one underlying cause, guns or entertainment, what would it be?
If you gave me a choice between guns and entertainment, obviously guns are amenable to government action, whereas the content of entertainment is protected by the First Amendment. I think that self-restraint in the media is important.

The fact that the average child sees 20,000 murders on television by the time of high school graduation should give us some pause. Violence is a cheap industrial ingredient that is too frequently used as a substitute for creativity.

When you talk about self-restraint, would you want to create a set of voluntary guidelines that the industries affected would agree to submit to?
Look, I oppose censorship, period, I am opposed to the government regulating content, period. I think that the encouragement of self-restraint is an appropriate role. The V-chip is an appropriate choice to give to parents of young children. I think that labeling was a good idea. I know it's controversial, but less now than it was when Tipper started advocating it. I think that the voluntary agreement entered into by the Internet service providers to give parents a protection page that includes one-click access to an immediate listing of what Web sites their kids have been visiting lately is a good idea. Because that's bargaining power in the hands of parents — that's not censorship, that's parenting.

The first thing that happens when one of these incidents occurs is that a bunch of conservative senators stand up and blame violence in movies and music and video games. Do you think a real cause of some kid going out and massacring twelve people is that he played a violent video game?
Well, I think that there are some people who are afraid to take on the gun lobby, and they pump a lot of energy into criticizing the entertainment issue in order to compensate.

So you think it's scapegoating?
Yes, I do, but I think that there are others who are plugged into the entertainment scene who overreact in the opposite direction and assert that it plays no role whatsoever. Now, of those 20,000 murders that an average child sees on television before graduation, most are images that fall like water off a duck's back to no great effect. But I think some of this violent imagery falls into the minds of children who, for whatever reason, are slightly more vulnerable — not many, but some of them are. And the imitative behavior or numbness to violence that can be accentuated by that exposure I think is undeniable. I mean, the fact that the two kids who perpetrated this horror at Columbine said, "This is gonna be just like Doom" is not irrelevant to our effort to understand what's going wrong here.

Look, we have a flood of negative attack political commercials on television every two years, and voter participation is going down. Would you say that this constant diet of negative attack ads plays no role in spurring the disillusionment with the political process? You would not. And in the same way, this ubiquitous use of progressively more gruesome violence in modern entertainment has an impact.

There's a violent pop culture in Japan and England, all over the world... 
And the one thing that stands out here is the availability of guns. American music is the dominant music of the world. American movies are the dominant movies of the world. These violent images are available in almost all countries, yet we are the one country with this incredible rate of gun violence. And it's because of the widespread availability of guns.

How would you characterize the leadership of the NRA?
Oh, I think they're very destructive. I haven't been afraid to take them on. I cast the tie-breaking vote to close the gun-show loophole. They targeted me.

Do you think they behaved responsibly?
No, of course not. They've behaved with breathtaking irresponsibility. And I think they're losing the confidence of many of their members and former members as a direct result.

Do you think the NRA is to blame for the fact that advanced automatic weaponry is so extraordinarily available to our kids? 
Yeah. The history of our frontier and the place that guns have occupied in the American consciousness does reflect a rather persistent importance that guns have occupied in American life since the pre-Revolutionary War period. But I also think the Second Amendment is clearly misused and misinterpreted by gun advocates today.

Demographically, you are right in the middle of the Sixties generation. What do you think were the most meaningful events of the Sixties, and what lessons do you draw from the era? 
The idealism of the New Frontier awakened my generation around the same time that Bob Dylan was asking in song, "How many times can a man turn his head, pretending he just doesn't see?" And then the assassination of President Kennedy marked a dividing line between the pre-Sixties and the Sixties. The country seemed, for many of us, to begin to lose its way. The confident, successful choices associated with the post-World War II era gave way to a series of blunders and bewildering mistakes that were epitomized by the Vietnam War and also had counterparts in domestic policies.

The civil-rights movement inspired us and raised our hopes and inflamed a love of justice that we hoped would roll down like mighty waters — the biblical phrase so often quoted by Thurgood Marshall and Dr. King. And then the assassination of Dr. King and, before that, the assassination of Malcolm X and the race riots that began in Watts in '65 shattered those hopes. Bobby Kennedy's campaign, likewise, raised hopes that our country was about to get back on the right path, and then he was assassinated.

Are you speaking for yourself?
I'm speaking for myself, yet I am also offering my experience as a representative experience of my generation. But I can only speak with authority about my own experience, and for me the assassinations were important punctuation marks for the Sixties.

Which one would you say hit you the hardest?
Well, all of them. The assassination of President Kennedy came at the start of this roller coaster through the rest of the decade. And, as first in the sequence, it probably had the most impact, although they were all crucial. In 1968, a few months after Bobby Kennedy was killed, I was at the Democratic convention in Chicago, as I know you were. I saw the Army jeeps with film cameras mounted on tripods carefully making pictures of all of us standing on either side of the street, and it was a chilling situation.

Then when Nixon was elected, it really took the wind out of the remaining idealism that so many in my generation felt. My father was targeted as the Number One target in the 1970 election by Nixon and Agnew. After his defeat for standing on principle, on the day after Christmas 1970, I left for Vietnam. When I came back, I watched Watergate unfold. I think, in many ways, "the Sixties" ended with the Nixon helicopter lifting off from the White House lawn after he resigned, taking off for San Clemente.

How did your experiences in the Sixties shape your values today?
Commitment to civil rights and equal rights and human rights. And the ending of discrimination on the basis of race, religion or sexual orientation, or disability, is a core value that comes out of my experience in the Sixties. The sense of idealism that survived and endured the decade has come back strong, not only for me but, I'm convinced, for millions of others in my generation. The insistence upon setting idealistic goals and shooting for them is something that is innately American but is also particularly shaped by the experience of those years.

What do you say to people like William Bennett who argue that the triumph of Sixties culture is responsible for all that's wrong in society today — moral decay and so forth?
I don't even know where to begin [laughs]. I just think that's wrong.

You've now spent eight years working with President Clinton. He must be the most influential person besides your father in terms of what you've learned about politics.
[Softly] No, I'm not sure that's the case.

Well, what have you learned from him about governing? 
I think that his stamina in the face of the most persistent assault that I've ever seen a president endure is testament to a personal energy toward good governance that is really remarkable. Never giving up, and saying to yourself, "I'm gonna prevail," is an important lesson. The level of energy devoted to an incredible range of issue and challenges is also admirable. You know — education, crime reduction, the environment, civil rights ... you can just go right down the list, and it's such a lengthy list.

Clinton is an acknowledged political master and has such incredible command of the process. Have you picked up any lessons on being a politician from him?
Sure. I'm not sure that I can identify what I've learned in detail, but I think that the persistence and stamina that I talked about is probably the most striking characteristic that I take away from the experience of working with him. We've had a very close friendship and working partnership.

What presidents do you admire the most?
Lincoln, Washington and Jefferson.

Which ones would you most like to emulate?
I think that the moral dimension to the leadership Lincoln offered during a time of unprecedented challenge is the highest quality to be desired in a president in times of crisis. I think the steadiness and contextual genius of Washington in gracefully, seemingly effortlessly, establishing patterns that were the equivalent of perfect pitch for American democracy is a quality that is devoutly to be desired in any president. The intellectual genius of Jefferson, combined with an intuitive capacity for a startling vision of human freedom, is at the heart of what the American experience is all about. Now, the energy and drive of FDR and Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton are essential for a successful presidency in the kind of world we live in in this new century.

What do you think it says that a clearly popular president was almost brought down by a sex scandal last year? If you look back on it, what do you think we've learned from the whole ordeal?
I don't know. We learned that the president made a serious mistake that hurt a lot. Hurt him and hurt the country. But we also learned that the American people have the wisdom and the sense of perspective to completely reject the kind of disproportionate penalty that the Republicans obsessively pursued out of motives that were too revealing of political ambition.

Do you think this hurt the Republicans? 
Yes, I do. I don't know fully how. I think the opportunity cost has not been fully measured or calculated yet. I think that they spent a lot of time and energy that would have been much more fruitfully invested in trying to solve the problems that face the American people. And as a result, they are way behind the curve now, and they are still advocating an outdated agenda that has, piece by piece and as a whole, been completely rejected by the American people.

And they don't seem to know it yet. They relied so heavily on their assumption that the American people would feel the same obsession they felt and the same revulsion. They didn't understand the context.

They didn't understand that the American people understand human nature — the way our founders understood human nature. When they look at the performance in office of Clinton and the successes of his economic, social and foreign policies, they place his personal mistakes on the scales and they're outweighed by all these accomplishments and successes. Some of them have changed their views of him as a person, but not their views of him as a president and certainly not their willingness to see him removed from office as a result of a personal mistake.

You've talked openly — and without regret — about smoking pot when you were young. Do you think it's appropriate that the punishment for possession or smoking or even selling small quantities of marijuana can lead to a prison sentence?
I do not favor the decriminalization of marijuana.

That's a different issue. 
The extent of the punishment is a matter that is primarily an issue of local and state law. I think that the country's posture against drug abuse is one that ought to put more emphasis on prevention and education, but I'm not prepared to support a weakening of criminal sanctions. Federal law requires mandatory minimums.

Do you think that is the right policy?
I support the "three strikes and you're out" approach. I think that the nature of the offenses that are calculated in the formula could usefully be reviewed to place more emphasis on violent crime.

Do you like the mandatory-minimum laws?
I have supported them. I think that drawing a hard line against marijuana use is the right thing to do. I know we disagree on that.

Yes, we do.

How about medical marijuana? Voters in seven states have supported the use of it, yet the Justice Department is prosecuting people for selling and distributing marijuana for medicinal purposes.

That's an issue that I think ought to be decided on the basis of science and not on the basis of a political judgment.

Or even votes? 
Or even votes. Absolutely. I support vigorous and well-funded research into the potential uses of marijuana or the cannabinoid components of marijuana to see if there are any uniquely beneficial medical properties. I think that a decision ought to be made on the results of such research. And pending that, I am not in favor of the medical use. My sister was prescribed marijuana cigarettes when she was going through chemotherapy in an effort to save her life from lung cancer, and that was during a time when Tennessee had legalized medicinal marijuana.

Did she use it?
Yes, and it did not work for her. Thus far, the research does not justify its use. And so I oppose it.

In terms of the economy, we're doing great now, but people fear that so much of our prosperity is based on a big Internet bubble and that if these stocks collapse we could be in for some tough times. Is that a worry to you?
As my friend [former Treasury Secretary] Bob Rubin often says, "Markets go up, and markets go down." The responsibility of policymakers is to make sure that we get the fundamentals right. And different analysts value the market in different ways. Will we have a correction? History says we will. Are we in a new era now? I think we are. How do those two realities interact? I don't know.

In the 1970s we had an industrial economy, much smaller than the economy we have today. The sudden increase in the price of oil, engineered by OPEC in 1973 and then again in 1979, sent shockwaves through the economy; the sudden increase in an external price factor bumped the pattern of our economy into a new relationship between inflation and unemployment. All of a sudden we had to come to grips with a new word, stagflation, which was coined to express the prevailing surprise that we could have high unemployment and high inflation at the same time. The leading cause was this massive impact of much higher oil prices suddenly being imposed. It took years for that to cascade through the economy.

Today we have an information economy, much larger than the industrial economy of the Seventies. The price for processing information is just as important in today's economy as the price of oil was in the industrial economy, and now there is a sudden and dramatic external price shift — but instead of the price of information going up, it's going down. It's being cut in half every 18 months. And that is bumping the economy into a new relationship between inflation and unemployment.

These days, the business pages are treating us to a regular diet of surprise that we can have very low unemployment — four percent right now — and low inflation. And unlike the oil shocks, this hasn't happened twice in six years, it happens every 18 months, and it is continuing to happen.

Business organizations most effectively adapt to this new reality by getting on the Internet. Businesses are forging new relationships not only with their customers but also with their suppliers and their employees and everybody else in the market. It's hard for businesses to raise prices now, because customers can go out there and find it from somebody else on the Internet. And if a business feels pinched in its margins, then it goes on the Internet and looks for more competitive suppliers and subcontractors. So it's not immediately clear to me that those who are betting on the higher values of Internet stocks are automatically wrong. We are living through a historical discontinuity. And at the same time, "Markets go up, and markets go down."

What do you think of the way George W. Bush is conducting his campaign?
Well, I'm gonna try and stay out of the Republican semifinal and concentrate on the Democratic semifinal. But I think that Governor Bush is advocating a very obsolete agenda. I mean, I also think that Senator McCain is. I think Senator Bradley is too, to a lesser extent. But, I mean, neither Bush nor McCain has the guts to say it's inappropriate to fly the Confederate flag above a state Capitol. Neither of them sees the danger of going back to illegal, back-alley abortions. Neither of them has a view of the need to invest in public education as the key to a learning society.

What do you think it says about Bush that the day after he gets trounced in the New Hampshire primary, his next event is at Bob Jones University to receive the endorsement of Dan Quayle? 
[Laughs hard] Yeah. [Laughs more] Well ... I would say that his instinct for strategic scheduling at that instant probably did not strike fear in the hearts of McCain's campaign.

What do you think of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura? I like him; I think he's certainly entertaining. I don't agree with a lot of his ideas, but I think that he's quite refreshing on a lot of other levels.

Is there a lesson to be learned in the way he connected to voters in his state?
He ran a great Internet campaign. People always want a sense of who the authentic person is that they're dealing with: "What's this person really like?" But I'm not an expert on his career.

One of the most interesting things in your book, Earth in the Balance, was the way you questioned whether you'd done enough to raise the issue of global warming, and yet you don't seem to have talked about the issue very much this campaign. Will it be a central issue for you this fall?
Yes. Yes, it will be. If you look back over the debates that I've had with Senator Bradley, you'll see that I have raised it in these debates numerous times. And, in fact, when protesters tried to disrupt the last debate in Iowa on the issue of global warming, I pleaded with the moderator to turn to the issue — even though those demonstrators went about it in an inappropriate way, I agree that global warming ought to be front and center in the campaign. I have brought it up numerous times. I've done events. The mainstream press does not like to cover the issue. It is not seen as part of the PC list of big issues.

Why do you think that is?
Well, I think that if you go out and ask the American people what's the most important issue facing us, it's way down on the list. I think the media are influenced by things like that. I think that the continuing opposition to a meaningful effort on global warming by a lot of people in the corporate sector has an influence on the media, too. But the attitudes are changing dramatically now. There's been a real sea change in public attitudes as well as corporate attitudes. And I'm going to make it a big issue in this campaign.

As president, how will you go after those interest groups that are against real change?
For more than 20 years, I have carried this banner of concern about global warming, and I have tried to awaken America's passion for solving this problem. There is a tremendous economic opportunity for the country here. I read a story in the Wall Street Journal last week about the chamber of commerce in Hong Kong issuing a report saying that the city's economic future is threatened by pollution levels that are discouraging businesses from locating there.

Throughout the developing world, growing cities have levels of pollution that are completely beyond anything in the American experience. And throughout the world, the growing population and the rising aspirations of people are driving a desire for higher standards of living without the levels of pollution that have previously been associated with that kind of growth. New technologies, new processes, new ways of going about it represent the real key. And if we build and sell those technologies here in the United States, we're going to ensure our dominance of the world's 21st-century economy, just as we were the leading power in the 20th century.

What about the U.S. auto industry, which once again seems hooked on selling gas guzzlers? 
Specifically, in '93, I negotiated a partnership for a new generation of vehicles with the Big Three. Next month they are going to unveil new prototypes. GM just announced a hydrogen-fuel-cell car — it gets 108 miles per gallon. The chairman of Ford, Billy Ford, just announced that he foresees the end of the internal-combustion engine. Those aren't my words. Those are his words. Daimler-Chrysler just bought Ballard Power Systems, the leading fuel-cell company. You're seeing a tremendous shift in the industry from being a part of the problem to being a part of the solution.

Even so, you're going to have to spend a lot of political capital to combat this.
And if I am entrusted with the presidency, I intend to do just that. This is one of the main reasons I'm running for president. I don't need to be president for a sense of personal wholeness. I don't need this to round out my personality. I want to be president in order to make the world a better place and to make our country a better place. 

INETY-FIVE DAYS BEFORE his first national election, Bill Clinton stepped into the back room of Doe's Eat Place, a café in downtown Little Rock, Arkansas. It was a few minutes before noon on Friday, July 31st, and the governor, dressed in a short-sleeved shirt, khakis and running shoes, seemed relaxed but tired. He began the conversation by explaining the provenance of Doe's — it's a knockoff, of sorts, of a steak-and-seafood shack in the Mississippi Delta. Nearly two and a half hours later, he answered the last two questions: Paul was his favorite Beatle, and he voted for, even campaigned for, the Young Elvis stamp. What follows is the conversation that occurred in between, along with accounts from correspondents Greider, O'Rourke and Thompson.

Wenner: I was struck at the convention, after the acceptance speech, with all of you up there not only dancing to Fleetwood Mac's "Don't Stop" but singing along with it. It warmed my heart, and I thought, "This is truly a generational ticket."

Thompson: Remember, Carter memorized all of Bob Dylan's lyrics.
He did?

Wenner: But when he was asked to name his favorite Dylan song, he couldn't. He said, "I can't; there's too many." And pressed to name two or three, he still couldn't give two or three.

Thompson: But he did quote Dylan in his Law Day speech. He cited Dylan and Reinhold Niebuhr as his two influences. It seduced me.

O'Rourke: Seduced you? You were out the door and —

Thompson: Yeah. I was a believer. Excuse me, I didn't mean to —
Yeah. Sometimes I think you can overdo this generational business. I hadn't thought about it quite as much until we were up there singing. I wanted to use that song all during the primary. It captured what I wanted to say about the country and the campaign.

The postwar generation was raised with this sense of unlimited possibility. And then, of course, it was rent by the war in Vietnam and the civil-rights years. I think fundamentally people in our generation are much more idealistic than a lot of others have been, 'cause we were raised to believe things were possible, that we can make a difference.

At the convention I felt a sense of real optimism and hope. A lot of my mail is from people who just have a sense that maybe the government can be made to work again, maybe the country can be made to succeed again, maybe things can happen again.

I was in Spokane [Washington] the other day. I'd never been there before, but one of the guys I lived with at Oxford, who was a Vietnam War resister, was from Spokane. I met a guy who'd been in his high-school class, and we started talking about him. And all of a sudden the years were melting away, and I could see this guy felt, well, maybe we're all going to be able to do something good, make this all come out all right after all.

And then I met with a group of citizens. There was this woman there about my age, and she said explicitly, "You've got to go in there and redeem the Sixties generation."

Thompson: Wow.

Wenner: People have been saying that Sixties idealism is dead, that it didn't work out, it was a wrong idea.
No. It didn't all work out, but we did a lot of good.

Wenner: What did we do that was good?
I think that a lot of the young people crossed racial lines in fighting for equal opportunity, for civil rights. Fundamentally, I still believe the opposition to the Vietnam War was accurate. It was the right position for the country. But there were also problems with it — excesses and perceived excesses. The country began to be pretty divided in the late Sixties and still is today.

Wenner: How badly do you think Vietnam hurt this generation, the experience of growing up mistrusting the government, of being cynical about government itself?
Vietnam did cause us to doubt the government, but it also caused a lot of self-doubt. People who went and sacrificed and thought it was right, then came home to a culture that said it was wrong. People who opposed the war — though most of us still think we were right — we were World War II babies. We wanted to serve our country; we wanted to be part of patriotic wars; we wanted to believe in sacrifice. We paid quite a price as a generation for the impact Vietnam had on the country.

Greider: Has 1992 seemed as weird to you as it has to us? Not the ups and downs of the race so much as the flash points of anger and antipolitics, which you've been a target of and also benefited from. 
I think by and large that's healthy. I think the American people are saying: "Pox on both your houses. This deal's not working for the average person. We may not know exactly what changes we want, but we want some fundamental changes." People are desperately yearning to go beyond the established political debate.

O'Rourke: But are people looking to politics to solve problems that maybe can't be solved politically? 
I think there's a tendency to do that. If you compare our performance with other countries', you see that you can't run a country like ours without a more activist government. Still, I think it's a mistake and a trap for the Democrats to pretend all our problems can be solved by the political system. Or by the national government.


O'Rourke: It's not just the Democrats. For fifty years people in both parties have been saying: "Bring me your problems, and I'll give you a solution. Maybe a maximalist solution, maybe a minimalist solution, but I'll bring you some kind of solution."
But I think when we started doing that, most of the problems we were talking about had solutions.

Greider: Back to the anger. What's underneath it? Are the people right to sense they've been cut out of their government? 
Yeah. Underneath the anger, there's the sense that government works for the organized, the rich and the powerful, not for ordinary folks.

Thompson: I believe that myself.
And I think they're right. The second thing is, there's a sense that nothing ever really gets done, that we don't make any progress, we don't change.

Then, underlying that — and this is what I tried to address in this campaign, with mixed results — there's a third element. People say this society's got a lot of problems but ask: "How can the government fix them? What am I supposed to do? How are we going to change the way we are? What is the role of the president in reducing infant mortality or teen pregnancy or drug abuse or whatever?"

There is a sense that the system works for the few, a sense that big problems don't get solved and a sense that a lot of these things are beyond the reach of our common endeavor. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. The census even shows it.

Greider: They know it, and they know that the politicians have not been talking about it.
That's accurate. And so there is an atmosphere of fear and concern and anger. But there's also an enormous amount of hope out there. People know we're in a new era, that the end of the Cold War gives us a sense of new possibility. And this is — at least it always has been — an incurably optimistic country. Our ability to re-create ourselves at critical junctures is why we're still around after all this time.

Greider: When you say "mixed results," I'm curious. Are you grading yourself on how well you've communicated all this? 
I think I've done well at times and not so well at times. Part of it had to do with static in the atmosphere, part of it had to do with just trying to craft an honest and responsive message. But I do believe that to make people believe in politics again, you have to say three things. "Here's how it's going to be fair: It's going to work for everybody. But more important, here's how it's going to work: We're going to restore economic opportunity and a sense of progress." Then I think you've got to say to people: "There are limits to what a government can do if you don't do your part."

O'Rourke: That interests me, because if you add up federal, state and local spending, government in one form or another is spending forty-seven percent of our gross national product. That means that forty-seven percent of GNP is being allocated by political means rather than individual choice. I'm concerned about the governmentalization, politicization of so much of our lives. Is it possible to say no to the voters? 
Yeah, but I think we need a government that is in some ways less and in some ways more, a government that's different.

Take health care. We need a system of health care that is private but where the government organizes the insurance markets so that you have managed competition. A system that gives everybody access to basic care and controls the cost but where the docs, the hospitals, the providers and the insurers are still in the mix. That requires more government activity. On the other hand I think that we need less government micromanagement of the health-care system, fewer people on the government payroll second-guessing every decision.

Greider: Governor, what I hear from my labor friends is that you're stuck in the middle on health-care reform, that — you know the argument — you're not willing to go all the way to a — 
Single-payer system.

Greider: Yeah, a single-payer system like Canada's, because that will get you tagged as a tax-and-spend liberal.
No, I'm not willing to do it because the Canadian system is fee-for-service, with no incentives to manage cost, and taxpayer financed, with no incentives for citizen-contribution restraint; it has the second-highest rate of cost increase in the world. Ours is the first highest.

Greider: It's still better than ours.
It's better than ours, but I think you get quicker response to certain procedures here. But look at Hawaii. It has a mixed system, with sweeping insurance reforms, heavy emphasis on primary and preventive care, outreach, and its insurance premiums are half.


Wenner: It's a small system. 
I'm simply saying there are some reforms that work. Look at Germany. Germany kept costs under the rate of inflation in the last six years, and they have private insurers in the mix.

Wenner: What are you going to cut within the health-care system?
You've got to look at where the money's going. Because of the way the government has set the system up, we have the most expensive insurance system in the world.

For example, in America, eighty-four cents of the health-care dollar goes to health care, sixteen cents to administration and profit and private insurance companies. In Europe, the first figure's ninety-five cents, and that relates almost entirely to the way the insurance market is organized. Here, we have 1500 separate companies writing smaller and smaller policies on smaller and smaller groups, necessitating a blizzard of paperwork to keep up with all the differences by doctors and hospitals and the way the government regulates health care. What you've got to do is take money out of administration and insurance and put it into direct health care.

Wenner: How do you do that?
Mandate insurance reforms. Simplify the basic package that everybody gets, either from the government or their private employers. And give significant incentives for people to be in very large health-care groups where they have managed care. I was in Las Vegas the other day, and I met with a doctor who heads an HMO [health-maintenance organization] with 700 doctors, so you get lots of physician choice. In the last five years, the costs to enrollees have gone up or down within a range of two percent. By contrast, Medicaid and Medicare are going up at eleven percent a year; private insurance premiums, depending on the size of the employer, are going up even more.

Greider: I want to ask about the politics of all this. Part of the reason for the alienation and anger is that things get proposed, promises get made and —
They die in dark holes.

Greider: The system sort of chews it apart and nothing happens.
There's a big difference now. This is the first time all the candidates in one major party have campaigned for some sort of comprehensive health reform. Elections make a difference in terms of ratifying things.

Second, Jimmy Carter said he'd do it, too, but there's been much greater specificity this time and much more public outcry for it. You can go to any substantial group of people and ask them if they know someone who couldn't change jobs, for example, 'cause they had a preexisting health condition and no one would take them. Worker mobility is one of the most important values in an entrepreneurial society, where most jobs are created by small businesses. The present healthcare system is a big brake on that.

Third thing, there's a generalized demand for shaking the system up. You're going to have a hundred new congressmen, and a lot of those who survive are going to have to promise to be more effective and different And of course, you're going to have to roll some of the interest groups.

Wenner: How are you going to "roll" them? 
That's what we're having an election about. When you run on the specifics, as opposed to general, you have a lot more leverage. Second, key point, you're going to have a hundred new congressmen. A lot of people in Congress will want the thing to change.

Thompson: I hate to seem to be anti-health, but I'm concerned about a nation obsessed with law enforcement and rules. I'm worried about the Constitution, especially the Fourth Amendment. 
I don't have the same view of the crime issue you have. I came here from across the river in North Little Rock, talking to a couple hundred kids — and their parents — who participate in a midnight basketball league the mayor started and we helped him with. It's one of the reasons we've had a significant decline in crime on that side of the river this summer as compared with last.

Almost all of them I was talking to are black, almost all of them are middle- or low-income people. Crime's a real big deal to them. They feel very threatened, and they were very pleased about this 'cause they thought it gave their kids a chance to do something good and to be part of something good.

My problem with Bush is that he's been more show than go on crime. He goes for symbolic things that are popular ideologically but don't do much to reduce crime. I don't agree that he's trying to put too many police on the street. He's cut back on aid to cities.

If you want less police brutality, you should have more police on the street, walking the streets, doing community policing. New York City went to community policing and has just reported its first crime drop in thirty-six years.

O'Rourke: We're also engaged in what seems to be a losing war with drugs. Is the continued criminalization of drugs a wise move? Or should we legalize them?
The war on drugs has enormous costs, but legalizing drugs would have enormous costs, too. Particularly if you legalize drugs that carry a high probability of death or generational addiction. It's a very tough call. My own view is that you should not legalize them, because the costs on the backside — increased usage — would swamp you.

Wenner: But then what are you going to do about the war on drugs?
The Bush administration has put a lot of money into federal agencies, and I think a lot of it ought to be put on the street — into drug treatment, into proven preventive programs and into community-based boot camps. In the long run, it's fine to do more on enforcement and, with the winding down of the Cold War, we actually have some opportunities to do more. But the fact is that five percent of the world's people are using fifty percent of the world's drugs. Those are the stats in America. So you have a demand culture in America which is overwhelming. That's what we need to focus on.

Most of the people in the drug culture are profoundly disconnected from the rest of our country. They live in places where it is harder to answer the question "Why not?" The issue is, how do you reconnect them? How do you give them some reason to live the life you're calling them to live?


O'Rourke: I'm very disturbed about what's happening among the economic underclass. People seem to be conceiving of themselves exclusively as victims. Many in black areas believe the United States government invented AIDS and crack in order to destroy the black population. What can a government, especially the federal government, do here?
A number of things. First of all, a lot of these places are economic basket cases that could be the target of investment for community-service work, for public-service work, infrastructure work, which, compared to other countries, we're way deficient in anyway.

One of the things you ought to think about, since you're concerned about how much money government takes out of the economy, is how we managed to quadruple the deficit in twelve years and reduce investment at the same time. Every major country with which we're competing invests a higher percentage of its income, through government, in roads and bridges and airports and trains and everything, you name it, than we do. There's an argument to be made there for job generation.

Second, you have to go into these areas with strategies that enable people to take control of their own destiny. Right now we have the worst of both worlds. In vast blocks of cities, the only incomes come from the government or from drugs. We need to create a small-business entrepreneurial economy in every underclass urban area and rural area in the country through the use of banks like the South Shore Bank, which played a major role in revitalizing the South Side of Chicago.

We need to give people in public housing more control over their own lives through tenant management and ownership. I've been through a lot of those housing projects in Chicago.

O'Rourke: Terrifying, aren't they?
Yeah, but I've also been through those that have been swept and cleaned, that have gotten the drug dealers out, that are safe, where people who work on patrols with law-enforcement officials get credit against their monthly rent. For a lot of them, it's the first job they ever had. They've been empowered to take their own lives back.

To most people, "empowerment" sounds like a buzzword, but the truth is that America can't get very far with a dependent or helpless population. Trying to create an entrepreneurial economy around a different sort of banking system, investing in public-works jobs in the near term and giving people control over their living conditions and requiring them to take more responsibility for it — those are the kinds of things that I think would make a real difference.

Greider: Cassandras like myself have been saying that just as the taxpayers were stuck after the 1988 election with the S&L bailout, the same thing is happening this year; that some time in 1993, no matter who's elected president, somebody will announce, "Hey, folks, the commercial-banking crisis is worse than we thought, and you're going to have to pick up the tab." Do you agree? And if so, why aren't you telling the folks right now that that's where we are?
The answer is, I don't know if that's where we are. I'm trying to find out. When I became governor again in 1983, my bank commissioner was predicting that the S&L crisis would be exactly what it has become. With the banking system there's a slightly different set of problems; I think it's more isolated, not as widespread.

Greider: But isn't the government stalling again? They're not closing down the banks, and they're not dealing — 
They're not closing the banks, and they're trying to retrieve a number of them. But let me go back to your question. I don't know the answer. I'm trying to find out, but if I'm convinced you're right, I want to raise a lot of Cain about it so we'll prepare people for whatever has to be done later.

Greider: You've staked out a very different idea of a banking system, very different from what anybody — either Democrat or Republican — has been talking about for the last fifteen or twenty years. Can you give us a quick sketch of your ideas? 
I think every major urban area and every poor rural area ought to have access to a bank that operates on the radical idea that they ought to make loans to people who deposit in their bank.

Greider: That's pretty radical.
It's not happening today. A certain percentage of the bank assets of this country have to be devoted to community banking. The lesson of the South Side of Chicago is you need to have people in banks who understand how to make loans to low-income people, who understand that they're just like other people — that there are differences among them and differences in the quality of their loan proposals.

It is inherently unreasonable to believe that there wouldn't be vast markets for all kinds of small businesses in a place like South Central Los Angeles that could be owned and operated by the people who live there. Over a period of years, the South Shore Development Bank has helped restructure the economy and the society of the South Side of Chicago by making loans to people who live in the neighborhood, by creating a lot of entrepreneurs in housing rehab and other small businesses.

What I propose, in effect, is to create one of those banks in every urban area of any size and every rural area — in the Mississippi Delta, in south Texas. We've had the first rural version of the South Shore Bank up and going in Arkansas for a couple of years, and it's like everything else. It's made some mistakes, but on balance it's done a lot of good.

You know, the South Shore Bank's Good Faith Fund — loans to real low-income people, mostly for self-employment ventures — was based on the work of Muhammad Yunus at the Grameen Bank, in Bangladesh, which until the recent natural disasters had a ninety-seven-percent loan-repayment rate, better than the commercial banks in Bangladesh, even though it was making loans almost exclusively to poor people.


Greider: I'm intrigued because, with a few eccentric exceptions, I think you're the only politician I've ever encountered who has heard of the Grameen Bank, much less —
I think Muhammad Yunus should be given a Nobel Prize.

Greider: How did you get into that? Is that your policy-wonk side?
Only partly, and partly it was a fluke. My wife had a roommate in college who worked for the South Shore Development Bank. They knew about Yunus, and they started a good-faith-fund loan for low-income people, and they did it in teams.

You know, the way it works in Bangladesh is five village women show up, the bank tells them how loans work, how principal and interest works, how the bank makes its money. The women decide what they're all going to do, and then they get the money serially, in teams, so when person No. 1 has paid back for a certain number of times, person No. 2 gets a loan, et cetera, till the team has the loan, the team pays off the loan.

Several years ago, this friend of Hillary's arranged for me to meet with Yunus in Washington, and I spent an hour and a half with him. I was just blown away. It was obvious what the parallels were. He made enterprise work. He promoted independence, not dependence. The idea struck me that whenever the power of the government can be used to create market forces that work, it's so much better than creating a bureaucracy to hire a bunch of full-time people to give somebody a check. I mean, I just loved it. I loved it.

Greider: Yesterday you used the phrase "economic crisis." Are we flirting on the edge of something really disastrous, not just in the United States but globally?
There is some reason to worry about international depression or recession. A lot of other economies are slow, but in large part because when our economy is down, we can't buy as much from others. The best thing we can do to avert a world crisis is to get our economy going.

Thompson: Is bank reform going to energize the fifty percent of the electorate who don't vote?
Well, let's talk about the economy for a while, and then we'll come back to the voting thing. I think there are a lot of voters who would like to vote this year who haven't been voting.

Thompson: You bet.
And I was mad that Bush vetoed the Motor Voter bill. If nothing else, it was a good gesture to the young and to the disaffected that said, "Hey, we want you to be part of this system."

There is a big debate, as you well know, about whether the primary cause of our economic difficulties is the deficit, which contributes to keeping long-term interest rates high even though the Fed has brought short-term rates way down. Or whether our difficulties are caused by underinvestment plus systems that don't work. That is, we need to invest more, but we need to make sure we get our money's worth.

The thing that bothers me is, what does cutting the deficit drastically do to the other countries of the world, and what does it do here? How many opportunities will the United States forgo if we give up the investment strategy?

O'Rourke: By "investment" you mean federal investment?
No, I mean capital investment, public and private. We need a whole bunch of things in this tax code that focus on increasing private investment. Most jobs are created in the private sector. We've got to have an investment program that acknowledges that. I strongly favor an investment-tax credit, a long-term, new-venture, capital-gains tax. I was talking recently to big venture capitalists in California, in Silicon Valley. They said a five-year holding period for new ventures would make a lot of difference to them, and it would only go to people who were creating new jobs. You wouldn't be churning stocks with it. I favor making the research-and-development tax credit permanent.

But to go back. If high-wage, high-growth countries are producing more-productive people, more new jobs in high technology, more investment in infrastructure than we are, and if everything in the world is mobile except people, the natural resources in your country and the infrastructure you lay down, then I come down on the investment side. We must reduce the deficit but at a more measured pace than others would, because there's a limit to how much taxes can be raised, and because we've got to increase investment.

America has got to get growth back. Growth comes from productive investment — private and public — and I think we can do it and still dramatically lower the deficit enough to get long-term interest rates down. If we only go for the money solution, we give up a lot of jobs, productivity and competitiveness.

Greider: What you're saying about investment is good, but I don't see how you can reverse the decline in wages if you don't also take on the global economy in a more direct way than you seem to be willing to do.
Maybe we'll have to become as protectionist as Germany and Japan, but I hope not.


Greider: That would be a start.
If you look at what produces a high-wage, high-growth economy, you might have to take on the terms of trade and the global economy more; I concede that. But if you look at America and compare it with any of the rich European countries — and Germany's the easiest because it's the only one that's even close to our size — you see that they are better educated, they invest a higher percentage of their money in their own infrastructure, but they also have much better systems for taking their best ideas and turning them into jobs in their countries.

Here's the one thing where I'm a little crossways with you. Take two examples: steel and automobiles. From the point of view of the labor movement, our trade policies in steel and automobiles have been disastrous — look at the number of auto-worker jobs and steel-worker jobs we've lost. But if you flip it over, we are still using more people per car to make cars than the Japanese are. They use more robots, right? And some of our steel mills are making tons of money, mostly these minimills, when they're highly capital intensive and using fewer people.

The conclusion I reach is that we have to downscale the number of people we use to make cars. The difference between America and Germany is, right now we just let those people go. We need to be creating opportunities for those people. In Germany business and government and education and labor are all on the same side, and they are moving much more rapidly in tandem into newer technologies and newer jobs.

Greider: Everybody can't become a computer technician or even a high-value-added industrial worker. What about the millions of people with low-wage service jobs who've had the hell kicked out of them for the last ten or twenty years? 
After having finally raised the minimum wage — finally — we ought to at least keep it up with inflation. The second thing we need to do is to raise the earned-income tax credit [EITC]. In the last decade, we've gone from twelve percent of our population to eighteen percent working forty hours a week and still living below the poverty line. That's a huge increase. For $4 billion, if our numbers are right, we can raise the EITC enough to lift everybody who's working forty hours a week, who has a kid in the house, above the poverty line. I would think almost every American, conservative or liberal, would like that.

Greider: Is that the beginning of a kind of broad social contract, like some of the European countries have, that takes everything from child care to health care to wage levels —
But it's all got to be focused on making people able to do what people have to do. In other words, it's not government so much as care giver; it's government empowering people to succeed on their own terms. That's what I love about the EITC. That's what I also like about child-care vouchers, which is something we do in this state. We make it harder to raise kids in this country than nearly any other major country — and it's still the most important work.

Let me make one final comment, and this is something that politicians in this country ought to be upfront about. We are not like Germany and Japan. We have always renewed ourselves through wave after wave after wave of immigrants. And I have always been supportive of that. It's exhilarating to go to Los Angeles County and see people from 146 different ethnic groups.

But if that is our strategy, particularly now that many wages are set on a global scale, then we are going to have to reconcile ourselves not to being a hard-work, low-wage country but to having a higher percentage of people at lower wage levels. What's killing us is that these poor folks now don't think they can be rewarded for their labors.

Greider: You're attacking the privileged interests in Washington; you're proposing some ideas about containing lobbyists or at least forcing them out in the open a little bit more. And then people look at your campaign and see the money coming from the K Street lobbyists in Washington, Wall Street and so forth. Help us through that contradiction. Which side are you really on? 
I don't think it's an inherent contradiction. They all knew where I stood on this before they gave me any money.

Greider: Why are they giving you the money?
I don't know. A lot of them believe the country will be better off if I win. There are a lot of people who didn't give me money, too, when I said I wanted a tax system that gave incentives for companies to do stock options and employee ownership and to give people more incentives to put money back in the companies.

Greider: Like who?
I don't want to embarrass them, but there were a lot of them. Let me just say I view this the way Roosevelt did. Roosevelt always said he was trying to make free enterprise work. He said he was never against business, never against the vital private sector. What is killing the government is that it has been too responsive to a relatively narrow segment of the business community which controls a lot of money but not as many jobs as they used to —


Greider: The biggest corporations. 
That's right, and which has not necessarily acted in its own interest. You also have to make clear distinctions between corporations. We've got a company in my state — Nucor — that's nonunion but has two steel mills, pays their workers an average of $42,000 a year. They get weekly bonuses, and no one has ever been laid off. When profits go down, bonuses go down. If Nucor loses money, the boss takes a bigger cut than the workers do.

You don't want to generalize about — but this is not so much business versus labor; it is dumb versus smart. The really smart businesses today empower their workers, reward them for being productive, take care of their interests. I'm not going to ever be antibusiness, 'cause that's where the jobs are. But do we need more power concentrated in the hands of people who are going to take care of workers? You bet we do.

Greider: But it's not a matter of being pro- or anti-business. In 1992, people are deeply suspicious of the grid of connections in Washington, and you're in that grid in a very real sense.
Well, a lot of my supporters thought I was going to win. A lot of them supported me because they believed in me, a lot of them supported me 'cause they knew me and in spite of the fact they didn't agree with me.

Greider: Let me have one more nibble at this question. Goldman Sachs, the big investment house of Wall Street, has dumped more money on you than any other. What's the relationship there?
Ken Brody was a big partner in Goldman Sachs who's now sort of semiretired. Although he'd been supporting Republican candidates, he decided the country was going in the wrong direction, and he looked around and found me. He said: "This country's been good to me, I made a lot of money, I'm worried about the country going downhill, I'd like to turn it around. You don't have to agree with me all the time, I want to help you." And he decided to become my New York finance chairman. That's how it happened.

Wenner: What's your take on George Bush?
I don't know how to answer that I spent quite a bit of time with him over the last ten years. Until I started running for president, I had a pretty good relationship with the White House. When I thought they were right, I'd stand up for them. We worked together on national education goals, and I worked with Reagan's White House on reforming welfare laws. I like to get things done, and I've never let my party label stand in the way of doing things.

My feeling about Bush is that his biggest liability is a limited and dated view of what makes an economy run in these times. This is not just a question of him being the captive of his interest groups, as opposed to Democratic interest groups. I think Bush really believes that it's a nice thing if you can make education better and, when you can, help the environment a little bit, but the No. 1 thing you can do to manage an economy is to keep tax rates low on the wealthiest individuals and the biggest companies and then get out of the way; they'll make good investment decisions and everything will be fine.

I don't think Bush sits around and thinks about stuff I sit around and think about — all this stuff y'all call policy-wonk stuff: What is the comparative rate of investment in infrastructure between Germany and Japan? Or what are the comparative educational statistics?

Look at all these other countries governed by conservatives. They believe that what cuts it in the global economy is, do you have a good partnership? Is government promoting enterprise and not regulating it to death? Is government investing in those things that government invests best in? Is it doing a good job with education and infrastructure? Is there some sort of partnership to keep opening new areas of opportunity in new technologies?

We're still fighting yesterday's battles. We're still business against labor, government against business, rich against middle. That's Bush's view of the world.

Greider: Aside from all that, would you like him as a golf partner or as a friend?
He was always very nice to me until we had our political falling out. But this has nothing to do with liking or disliking; it has to do with my view that the country is in deep trouble and is on the wrong track. If anybody else had run this year who embodied my thoughts about what ought to be done, in terms of going beyond the present Democratic-Republican debate, the tax and spend versus borrow and spend, I might well not have run. I was having a good time down here, and there was nowhere near the personal problems that apparently existed between Bush and Ross Perot.

Greider: But what you just said is very different from the image that's been constructed this year: that you've been planning to run since you were fourteen. 
If I was doing that, why in the living daylights would I do it when Bush had seventy-five-percent approval? All this business about how everybody gets one free run at the White House, with nothing to lose — that's not true. First of all, it's just not true you don't have anything to lose. Look what I've been through this year. And secondly, if you become the nominee, you normally don't get more than one chance.


Thompson: What do you have to lose?
You give up a lot of your life, a lot of your privacy. There's a lot of pain involved in it. I've had a wonderful time. I must say I've learned a lot about the country, and I've enjoyed it, and I wouldn't trade the experience, but it's not been an easy one, as you know.

Greider: One of your guys told us last night that the last two weeks have probably been the best two weeks of your professional life.
Maybe. I don't know.

Wenner: How does it feel when you wake up and the Field poll in California says 62-28? 
I like it a lot better being up than down, but I don't take it very seriously. This is a very volatile year. What that poll means now — before the Republican convention and before they've unloaded on me and unloaded on my state and told everybody how I'm responsible for everything that happened here — is that people are dying to believe again, they're dying to hope again. You ought to read my mail — people my age writing me, saying they haven't felt this way since Kennedy was president or since Bobby Kennedy was killed. All those polls mean is people desperately want this country to work again.

We have to be optimistic in this. It kills this country to be pessimistic and cynical and out of it, and so people are beginning to permit themselves to have some hope again. And I think, for all kind of reasons, my asking Gore to join the ticket really reinforced that.

Thompson: If, like Brazil, we had a law that everybody had to vote, would your polls be different now? Or would your outlook be different?
No. Because what I've said is what I believe is best for all the people in this country, whether they vote or not. So I'd be running the same campaign, and I think the polls would be about the same. I wish we could open up the system and make it more accessible. But I wouldn't be running a markedly different campaign if that were so.

Greider: You were for the war in Iraq, and you supported some of the other U.S. interventions in the last ten years. You are now saying we need to use military force to intervene for different reasons. What's so different from what you're saying and what Bush is saying about a new world order?
There's a significant difference. I believe he prefers stability over ferment and democracy and freedom. That's why he was a little slow in dealing with the democracy movements in the republics of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and why, I think, he was so soft on China. I really disagree with him there. I think that's why, as soon as the gulf war was over, he was willing to let the Kurds and Shiites be subjected to some things that were unacceptable and which we could have stopped. He favored the stability of Saddam Hussein over the prospect of the breakup of the territory known as Iraq.

The end of the Cold War, the total devolution of central authority in what was the Soviet Union, an apparently good-faith relationship with Yeltsin and our attempts to substantially reduce nuclear arms give us the freedom that we have never had in my lifetime to stick up for those things we believe in — for freedom and democracy and human rights and free-market economics.

O'Rourke: Do you think we could be doing more in Yugoslavia, for instance?
Yeah. It's dicey. You may have seen the statement I put out last week about it — when Fitzwater jumped on me about it, said I was being reckless, and then Cheney and Dick Lugar said they agreed with me. I think that we ought to keep that airport relief effort open. We have to keep open the option of air strikes against Serbian installations. Going beyond that is somewhat dicey, because in Bosnia you have what is plainly a civil war, which is difficult to intervene in, as opposed to protecting territorial boundaries.

Greider: I don't hear you talking about the national-security state that grew up out of the Cold War. 
One of the things I called for in my defense budget was a reduction and redirection of intelligence spending. A lot of the things we justified because of the Cold War and the apparently always-imminent threat of conflict with the Soviets — a lot of that's just not there anymore. We need to redirect our intelligence efforts and open them up a little bit. You know, it's interesting what happened in Iraq. We overestimated their conventional military strength, but we underestimated their capacity in weapons of mass destruction — biological, chemical and nuclear.

Thompson: Who'd be your first appointee to the Supreme Court?
I don't want to get into that. I have said that Mario Cuomo was the sort of person I thought would be a good judge, somebody with an expansive view of the Constitution and passionate devotion to the Bill of Rights and a capacity to argue through to the end of things.

Thompson: Who on the current Supreme Court would you have appointed? 
Harry Blackmun. Wonderful man.


Greider: Do you feel fragile, confident or ordained at this moment of history to reverse the direction of the country? 
I feel confident that I can — if given the opportunity to be president, with the kind of people I would bring in and the new sense of energy I think would be unleashed in the country — I think we could do it. I feel confident about the election. I think we're on the right side of history. The time has come for America to change its policies fundamentally. But I don't feel ordained, and I don't think the results of this election are foreordained. I think it's going to be a very, very difficult election. I don't care what these polls say; the polls show the people want to hope.

Keep in mind, it still takes more courage to vote for change than it does to stay where you are. And it is not true that hope is always a stronger emotion than fear. In fact, you could argue that usually the reverse is the case.

O'Rourke: Thomas Paine did.
What?

O'Rourke: Thomas Paine argued that the reverse was usually the case.
I think we have an excellent chance to win. I believe if I do win, we would be well positioned to deal with some of these thorny problems and to have the mandate to deal with them. But I think that we're going to have over ninety days of real, real struggle to do this.

Thompson: Caligula argued that, too. Thomas Paine and Caligula.

O'Rourke: Yes. I don't know if we want to get Caligula in on this.

Greider: Congressional Democrats have colluded with the Republicans on a lot of the things you've criticized. What makes you think that beast is going to change just because you're in the White House?
Because we'll have an operative majority for a more progressive course, if there is a president who will take the lead. A lot of those things you're talking about weren't supported by a majority of the Democratic party but by just enough Democrats to have some sort of tax bill or some sort of economic package. I think it's clear that when you get this new blood coming in that the chances of change will be much greater than they've been in a very long time. Greater than they were when Carter was elected, after Watergate. Watergate was not a mandate for change; it was a mandate for good government.

O'Rourke: One very specific change.
You got it. Good government. This is not about good government; this is about doing different things.

Greider: One of Carter's big mistakes was that he wasn't willing to take on titans in his own party. He thought that somehow they would all cooperate. What about you? 
I don't want to pick a fight, but I think we're going to have some. I don't want to overstate the case, but it's almost like the rebirth of our resolve to do some very fundamental things, and to do them, you're going to have to have — everybody's going to have to change, including the interest groups of both parties. You cannot leave things the way they are now and expect to solve the problems we've got. All we're going to get is paralysis and more decline.

Greider: You're going to break some eggs within the Democratic party?
Well, we're going to make some nice omelets.
